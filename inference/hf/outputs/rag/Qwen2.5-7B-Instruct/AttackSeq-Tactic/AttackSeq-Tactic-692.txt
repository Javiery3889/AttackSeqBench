Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor program has already gathered host information and executed evasion techniques. The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.004-DNS

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (A)**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources and information within the target network. It does not align with the next step of establishing communication with a C2 server.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the actor gaining access to the target environment. While it is a crucial first step, the question already mentions that the backdoor program has been installed and is gathering information, so this is not the next step.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems. It is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 server via DNS tunneling.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the actor establishing and maintaining access to the target environment. The technique T1071.004-DNS specifically mentions using DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. This aligns perfectly with the question's description of establishing communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor program has already gathered host information and executed evasion techniques.
- The next step is to establish communication with the C2 server.
- DNS tunneling is a method used to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.
- The specific technique T1071.004-DNS is mentioned, which directly supports the use of DNS tunneling for Command and Control.

### Final Answer: D
