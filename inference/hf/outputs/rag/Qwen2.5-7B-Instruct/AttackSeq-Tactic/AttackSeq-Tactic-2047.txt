Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Iron Tiger's rshell backdoor collects OS information.
2. The collected information is transmitted to a C&C server.
3. The backdoor continues to receive and execute commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection (Tactic):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system.
- **Data from Local System (Technique T1005):** This technique involves collecting information from the local system.
- **System Information Discovery (Technique T1082):** This technique involves discovering information about the system, such as OS version, installed software, etc.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or countermeasures. While the backdoor might use defense evasion techniques, the question focuses on the sequence of actions after the collection and transmission of information.
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems. The question does not mention moving to other systems, so this is less likely.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying and classifying information about the target environment. The backdoor has already collected OS information, which is a form of discovery. However, the question asks what happens next, not what was done first.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The backdoor is transmitting collected information to a C&C server and continues to receive and execute commands, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor has already collected OS information (T1082 - System Information Discovery).
- The collected information is transmitted to a C&C server, which is a form of Command and Control (T1086 - Exfiltration over C2 Channel).
- The backdoor continues to receive and execute commands, which is also a form of Command and Control (T1056 - Server-Initiated Client Action).

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible next step is the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D**
