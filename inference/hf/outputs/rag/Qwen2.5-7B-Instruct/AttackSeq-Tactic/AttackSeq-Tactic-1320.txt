Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts (cookie stealers and webmail session key manipulators) leading to the injection of persistent JavaScript through XSS vulnerabilities. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system or network.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system.
- **T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**: This technique involves stealing or hijacking a user's session to gain unauthorized access to their browser.
- **T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (T1185-Browser Session Hijacking)**: This technique is related to stealing or hijacking a user's session, which could be a precursor to executing malicious scripts. However, it is more about stealing session information rather than directly leading to the execution of scripts.
- **Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript)**: This technique is directly related to executing JavaScript, which aligns with the question's description of injecting persistent JavaScript through XSS vulnerabilities. However, this is more about the execution phase rather than the initial step.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target system, which is a necessary step before any malicious activity can occur. It could involve techniques like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or other methods to gain initial access to the system.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary controlling the compromised system, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary gains access to the system, steals or hijacks a session, and then executes malicious scripts.
- The most logical sequence would be to first gain access to the system (Initial Access), then use that access to steal or hijack a session (Collection), and finally execute the malicious scripts (Execution).

Given the options and the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Initial Access** (to gain access to the system)
- **Collection** (to steal or hijack a session)
- **Execution** (to execute the malicious scripts)

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
