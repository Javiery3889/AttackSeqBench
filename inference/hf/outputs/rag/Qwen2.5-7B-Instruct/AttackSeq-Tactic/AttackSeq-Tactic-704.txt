Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) are exploited to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
2. The next step involves a Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server for additional actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is not directly relevant to the next step after privilege escalation.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This is also not directly relevant to the next step after privilege escalation.
- **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** This is relevant but does not describe the next step after gaining arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
- **Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server (Technique):** This is directly relevant to the next step after gaining elevated privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding detection, which does not align with the described sequence of actions.
- **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data, which is not the next step after gaining arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
- **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic is about gaining higher-level access, but it does not describe the next step after gaining arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
- **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing a channel for remote control, which aligns with the described sequence of actions (communicating with a C&C server for additional actions).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes gaining arbitrary memory read and write capabilities through privilege escalation.
- The next step involves a Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server for additional actions.
- The related TTPs mention a Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server, which is a Command and Control (C2) activity.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
