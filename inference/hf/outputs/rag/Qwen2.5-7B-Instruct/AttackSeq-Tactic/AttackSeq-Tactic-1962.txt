Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. KiraV2 used anti-analysis techniques such as encoding strings and changing process names to evade detection.
2. Registration of signal handlers to hide the C&C server address.
3. Communication with the C&C server using hard-coded IPs to receive commands for DDoS attacks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: 
  - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: Encoding strings and changing process names.
  - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is relevant to the deobfuscation of the encoded strings and process names.
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: 
  - **T1071.004-DNS**: This technique is related to using DNS for C&C communication, but the question specifies hard-coded IPs, not DNS.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is about identifying and classifying resources. This does not align with the described TTPs of evasion and communication.
- **Answer Choice B: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information. This also does not align with the described TTPs of evasion and communication.
- **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
  - Defense Evasion is directly related to the techniques mentioned in the question, such as encoding strings, changing process names, and registering signal handlers.
- **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
  - Credential Access involves stealing or using credentials. This does not align with the described TTPs of evasion and communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are primarily focused on evading detection and hiding the C&C server address.
- The related TTPs confirm that Defense Evasion (T1027 and T1140) are directly relevant to the described techniques.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question (anti-analysis techniques, registration of signal handlers, and communication with hard-coded IPs) fits best within the context of Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
