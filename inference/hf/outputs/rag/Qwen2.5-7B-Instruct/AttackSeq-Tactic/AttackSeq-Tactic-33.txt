Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. It is not the first step in the attack sequence but rather a step that occurs after initial access.
- **Reconnaissance (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. It is a logical step that would precede the initial access via phishing.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. It occurs after initial access and is not the first step.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the techniques used to initially compromise a system or network. The question already mentions this as the point of initial access via phishing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the adversary gaining initial access via phishing emails. This indicates that the adversary must have performed reconnaissance to identify potential targets and craft the phishing emails.
- Reconnaissance is a necessary step before the initial access via phishing, as the adversary needs to know the target and how to craft the phishing emails effectively.
- The other options (Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, and Initial Access) do not fit as the first step in the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
