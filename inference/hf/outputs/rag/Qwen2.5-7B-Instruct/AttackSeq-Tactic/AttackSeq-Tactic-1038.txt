Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the tactic used before macOS malware like Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CrateDepression could maintain persistent access on target systems. This implies that the tactic in question is one that would be used to deliver the initial payload or gain a foothold on the system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide information about tactics and techniques that are relevant to the question:
- **Persistence**: Techniques T1505.003 (Web Shell) and T1543.001 (Launch Agent) are mentioned.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Technique T1543.001 (Launch Agent) is mentioned.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to the target system. It is the first step in the attack lifecycle.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised system, which is not the initial step.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system over time, which is a later step after initial access.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic is about gathering information to better understand the target, which is also not the initial step.

Given that the question is asking about the tactic used before maintaining persistent access, we need to focus on the initial steps of the attack.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs mention "Persistence" and "Privilege Escalation," but these are not the initial steps.
- The question is specifically asking about the tactic used before maintaining persistent access, which means it must be the initial step.
- The most plausible initial step in the attack lifecycle is "Initial Access," as it is the first step in gaining control over the target system.

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
