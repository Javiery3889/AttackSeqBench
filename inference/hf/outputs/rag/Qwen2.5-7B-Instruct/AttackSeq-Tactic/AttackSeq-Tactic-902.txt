To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that WinDealer's persistence was achieved through the registry's RUN key after an initial method. It also asks about the tactic that involved delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention Persistence and specifically T1547.001, which involves Registry Run Keys and Startup Folder. This indicates that the malware was eventually installed to persist via these mechanisms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and data, which is not directly related to the delivery mechanism or persistence.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running the malware, which is a step after initial access but not specifically about the delivery mechanism.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target, which is also not directly related to the delivery mechanism.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry point into the target environment, which could be through the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications.

Given that the question is asking about the tactic that involved delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications, the most relevant tactic is the one that describes how the malware initially gains access to the system.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications is a method of initial access, as it involves the malware being delivered and executed through a trusted channel.
   - The persistence mechanism (Registry Run Keys) is a step that occurs after initial access.
   - The related TTPs do not directly mention the automatic update mechanism, but the context of the question points to the initial method of delivery.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
