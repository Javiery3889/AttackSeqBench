Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Attackers distributed spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
2. These attachments exploited vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158).
3. The malware added a registry entry to enable automatic execution at every system startup.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP aligns with the first part of the sequence, where spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments were distributed.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP aligns with the second part, where the malicious attachments exploited vulnerabilities to execute the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This TTP is not directly related to the initial distribution of the spear-phishing emails or the exploitation of vulnerabilities. It is more about obtaining credentials, which typically happens after the malware has gained a foothold.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This TTP is directly related to the first part of the sequence, where the attackers distributed spear-phishing emails. However, it does not cover the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Answer Choice C: Collection**: This TTP is about gathering data, which is not directly related to the initial distribution of the spear-phishing emails or the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Answer Choice D: Persistence**: This TTP is about ensuring the malware remains on the system, which aligns with the third part of the sequence, where the malware added a registry entry to enable automatic execution at every system startup.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with the attackers distributing spear-phishing emails (Initial Access).
- The emails contain malicious attachments that exploit vulnerabilities (Execution).
- The malware then adds a registry entry to ensure persistence (Persistence).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Initial Access to Execution, and then to Persistence.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
