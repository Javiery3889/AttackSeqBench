Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where JavaScript and Windows executable files are executed to install malware. The next step in the attack sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.015-Electron Applications**: This technique involves using Electron applications to evade detection. Electron applications are typically JavaScript-based applications that can be used to execute malicious code.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves executing JavaScript code, which aligns with the execution of 05sall.js mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to other systems. The question does not indicate any movement to other systems, so this is unlikely.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information to identify assets and resources. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the execution of files and installation of malware.
- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system. The question explicitly mentions the execution of JavaScript and Windows executable files, which aligns with this tactic.
- **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a connection to a remote server for control and data exfiltration. While this is a common step after malware installation, the question does not indicate any immediate connection to a remote server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the execution of JavaScript and Windows executable files to install malware.
- The related TTPs mention the execution of JavaScript, which aligns with the actions described in the question.
- The next logical step after executing files to install malware would be to ensure the malware is running and functioning as intended, which is best described by the "Execution" tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
