Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading up to the execution of TDrop2 malware using process hollowing.
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
   - The next step is the execution of TDrop2 malware using process hollowing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the T1055.012-Process Hollowing technique, which is associated with the Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation tactics.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs after reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This is the initial step where the attackers gather information about the target environment.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves the actor gaining access to the target network or system, which typically happens before reconnaissance.
   - **Execution (A):** This is the step where the malware is executed, which happens after the reconnaissance and initial access.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves the actor stealing data from the target, which happens after the malware has been executed and is likely to be used to gather more information or to move laterally.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most logical step after reconnaissance is the initial access, which would provide the necessary foothold to execute the malware.

**Final Answer: B - Initial Access**
