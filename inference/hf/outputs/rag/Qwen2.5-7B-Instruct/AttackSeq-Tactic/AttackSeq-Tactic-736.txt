Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT, downloading of a malware configuration file, and exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client. We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT and before the data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique is about deleting files to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is the final step in the sequence described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**: This is the final step in the sequence, as the question mentions the exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client. However, we need to identify the tactic that occurred before this.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry point into the network, which typically precedes the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT. However, the question specifies that the CARBANAK RAT has already been deployed.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which could occur after the initial access and before the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT. However, the question does not mention any discovery activities.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a C2 channel, which is a common step after the deployment of malware like the CARBANAK RAT. The SmartFTP Client is mentioned as the method for exfiltration, which suggests a C2 channel is already established.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CARBANAK RAT is deployed, which is a step in the attack sequence.
- The malware configuration file "anunak_config" is downloaded, which is likely a step in the initial setup of the RAT.
- The next logical step would be to establish a C2 channel to communicate with the malware and control it.
- After the C2 channel is established, the attacker can use it to exfiltrate data.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT and before the data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D**
