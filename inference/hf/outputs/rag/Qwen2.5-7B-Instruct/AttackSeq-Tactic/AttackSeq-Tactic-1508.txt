Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and password brute forcing to move laterally across networks. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.001-Password Guessing**: This indicates that the attackers used password guessing to gain access to credentials.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This indicates that the attackers performed network service discovery to gather information about the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The question mentions that the attackers moved laterally across networks, which aligns with this tactic.
- **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network or system. The question mentions port scanning and system reconnaissance, which aligns with this tactic.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The question does not mention any communication or command and control activities.
- **D: Impact**: This tactic involves causing harm or damage to the target system. The question does not mention any specific actions that would cause harm or damage.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers used Metasploit for port scanning and system reconnaissance, which aligns with the **Reconnaissance** tactic.
2. They then performed privilege escalation, which is a step in the **Lateral Movement** tactic.
3. After gaining access to credentials through password brute forcing, they moved laterally across the network, which is the **Lateral Movement** tactic.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial reconnaissance and privilege escalation is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement
