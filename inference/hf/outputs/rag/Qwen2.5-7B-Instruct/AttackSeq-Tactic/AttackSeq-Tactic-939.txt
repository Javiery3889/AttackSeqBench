Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tropic Trooper exploited Microsoft Office Equation Editor vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. An installer package was downloaded.
3. The backdoor installer created a BITSadmin job.
4. The normal sidebar.exe file was launched to execute malicious actions.

We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the backdoor installer created a BITSadmin job and launched the normal sidebar.exe file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution)**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities to run code on the target system.
- **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File)**: This technique involves executing a malicious file.
- **Defense Evasion (T1197-BITS Jobs)**: This technique involves using BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) to transfer and execute files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance might have occurred before the initial access, it is not directly related to the specific actions described (creating a BITSadmin job and launching sidebar.exe).

- **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. While persistence might be a goal after the initial access, it is not the immediate action before creating a BITSadmin job and launching sidebar.exe.

- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves running code on the target system. The related TTPs mention T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and T1204.002-Malicious File, which align closely with the actions of creating a BITSadmin job and launching sidebar.exe. This suggests that the execution of the malicious installer and the subsequent actions are part of the execution tactic.

- **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel to control the compromised system. While this might be a goal after the initial access, it is not the immediate action before creating a BITSadmin job and launching sidebar.exe.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access and the download of the installer package are part of the exploitation for client execution (T1203).
- The creation of a BITSadmin job and the launch of sidebar.exe are actions that directly execute the malicious payload.
- The related TTPs specifically mention techniques related to execution (T1203 and T1204.002).

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the backdoor installer created a BITSadmin job and launched the normal sidebar.exe file is Execution.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
