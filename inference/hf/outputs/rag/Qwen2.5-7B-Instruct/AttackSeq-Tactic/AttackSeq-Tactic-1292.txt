Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading up to the initial access by OceanLotus through spear-phishing emails. The sequence starts with the spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a link to a malicious site via email.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall operation, it is not directly related to the initial access through spear-phishing.
- **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing the resources needed to carry out the attack, such as tools and infrastructure. This is not directly related to the initial access through spear-phishing.
- **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target. While this could be a step after initial access, it is not directly related to the initial access through spear-phishing.
- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the target's systems. This is more closely related to the initial access through spear-phishing, as the spear-phishing emails are used to gain access to the target's systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial access through spear-phishing emails, which are a form of reconnaissance and initial access.
- The related TTPs specifically mention spear-phishing links and attachments, which are techniques used to gain initial access.
- The answer choices that could be related to initial access are "Reconnaissance" and "Initial Access" (which is not directly listed but implied by the TTPs).
- "Discovery" is more about identifying vulnerabilities after initial access, which is not the focus of the question.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the initial access through spear-phishing is "Reconnaissance."

### Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
