Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control (C2) server.
2. The agent used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is the overarching tactic that encompasses the actions of establishing communication with a C2 server.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for data encryption.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This choice aligns with the tactic of establishing communication with a C2 server, which is a core part of the described sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration typically involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker. While the use of encryption for HTTP POST requests could be part of exfiltration, the question does not explicitly mention data being exfiltrated.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying and classifying resources. The question does not mention any discovery activities.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information or data. While the use of a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests could be part of data collection, the question does not explicitly mention data being collected.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the establishment of communication with a C2 server and the use of encryption for HTTP POST requests.
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions fall under the Command and Control tactic.
- The use of a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests is a specific technique (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography) within the Command and Control tactic.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the establishment of communication with the C2 server, which is a core part of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
