Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Communicating with three command and control (C2) servers.
2. Downloading and executing the FinSpy payload.
3. Displaying a lure document to the victim.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing link to deliver the initial payload.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to the target system via C2 channels.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This TTP is related to the communication with C2 servers, but it does not directly describe the download and execution of the payload or the display of the lure document.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
  - This TTP is more about transferring data out of the target environment, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Collection**
  - This TTP is about gathering data, which could be part of the overall attack but does not directly describe the download and execution of the payload or the display of the lure document.
- **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
  - This TTP is about obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Based on the related TTPs and the actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Initial Access** (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) to deliver the initial payload.
- **Execution** (T1204.002-Malicious File) to download and execute the FinSpy payload.
- **Command and Control** (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer) to communicate with the C2 servers.

However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to download and execute the FinSpy payload and display the lure document. The most relevant TTP here is the execution of the malicious file.

**Final Answer: D**
