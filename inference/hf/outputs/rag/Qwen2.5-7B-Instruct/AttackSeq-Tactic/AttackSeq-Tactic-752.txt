Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the exfiltration of documents to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
- **Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for exfiltration, which is also related to the final step.
- **Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves the automated collection of data, which is likely the step that precedes the exfiltration of documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**: While C2 is involved in the exfiltration process, it is not the step that precedes the collection and exfiltration of documents. It is more related to the communication channel used for exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: Persistence**: Persistence is a tactic that allows an attacker to maintain access to a system over a long period. While it can be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the sequence of collecting and exfiltrating documents.
- **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**: This is the final step in the sequence, not the step that precedes it.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. It is a logical step that would precede the collection and exfiltration of documents.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server.
- The related TTPs indicate that the collection of data (T1119-Automated Collection) is a critical step that precedes the exfiltration of data.
- Among the given answer choices, **Reconnaissance** (D) is the most plausible tactic that would precede the collection and exfiltration of documents, as it involves gathering information about the target, which is necessary before any data collection and exfiltration can occur.

### Final Answer: D
