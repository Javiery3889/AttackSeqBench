Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that a PowerShell script was used to deploy LightNeuron on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - After deployment, LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic "Discovery" and the Technique "T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery."
   - The related TTPs also mention the Tactic "Execution" and the Technique "T1059.001-PowerShell."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking which tactic most likely occurred before LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the technique for discovering system network configurations is part of the "Discovery" tactic.
   - Therefore, the "Discovery" tactic must have occurred before LightNeuron executed the functions to discover the network configurations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used a PowerShell script (T1059.001) to deploy LightNeuron.
   - LightNeuron then executed functions to discover system network configurations (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery).
   - The "Discovery" tactic is the most logical step that would precede the execution of functions to discover network configurations.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B: Discovery
