Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tickusb infected systems via USB flash drives.
2. The infection occurred before evading detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This indicates that the initial access to the system was through removable media (USB flash drives).
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This suggests that the malware might spread laterally through removable media, but this is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB**: This indicates that data might be exfiltrated over USB, but it is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred after the initial infection via USB but before the evasion techniques.

- **A: Discovery**: This tactic is about the adversary discovering information on the network or system. It is not directly related to the sequence of infection and evasion.
- **B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The question states that Tickusb infected systems via USB, which is an initial access method. However, the question asks for what occurred after the initial infection.
- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. Given that Tickusb infected systems via USB, the next step would be to execute the malicious code.
- **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining higher-level access on the system. This would occur after the malware is executed and has some level of control, but it is not the immediate next step after infection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The infection via USB (Initial Access) is the first step.
- The next logical step is to execute the malicious code on the system.
- Evasion techniques (altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution) would occur after the malware is executed and has some level of control.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: C: Execution
