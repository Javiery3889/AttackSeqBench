Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Hellsing APT group:
1. They used spear-phishing documents with CVE-2012-0158 exploits to gain initial access to the target systems.
2. After gaining access, a backdoor connected to a server at `philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com` to perform file operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is directly related to the spear-phishing attack mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique is related to the exploitation of the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: Initial Access**: This tactic is relevant to the initial phase of the attack, which is the spear-phishing and exploitation. However, the question specifically mentions that the backdoor connected to a server to perform file operations, which is a different phase of the attack.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is directly related to the backdoor connecting to a server (`philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com`) to perform file operations. This aligns with the described actions in the question.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent activities. While it might be a step that occurs after gaining access, it is not directly related to the described actions.
- **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems. The question does not mention any movement to other systems, so this is not relevant.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spear-phishing and exploitation are part of the initial access phase.
- The backdoor connecting to a server to perform file operations is a command and control activity.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the command and control activity.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
