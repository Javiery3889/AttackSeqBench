Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Deployment of Industroyer2 using the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol.
2. Execution of malware that includes wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the malware execution involving these wipers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This suggests that the malware is designed to cause damage or destruction.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This indicates that the malware is designed to delete files, which is a form of data destruction.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. Given the context of deploying malware and causing destruction, this does not seem to be the immediate next step after the execution of wipers.
  
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. The question already mentions the execution of malware, so this is not the next step.
  
- **C: Impact**: This tactic involves causing harm or damage to the target. Given the context of deploying wipers and the related TTPs mentioning data destruction, this aligns well with the next step after the execution of the malware.
  
- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. This does not fit the context of the malware causing destruction.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the deployment and execution of Industroyer2 and wipers.
- The related TTPs mention data destruction and file deletion, which are forms of impact.
- The next logical step after executing malware that causes destruction is to observe the impact of that destruction.

**Final Answer: C: Impact**
