Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. TeamTNT downloaded and executed a coin miner payload.
2. An action occurred that happened after the payload execution but before tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Command and Control (Tactic):**
  - Technique T1102-Web Service
  - Technique T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP (Execution, Discovery, Command and Control, or Exfiltration) fits best in the sequence after payload execution but before tracking infected hosts.

- **Execution (A):** This TTP is about running the payload. The question states that the payload has already been downloaded and executed, so this cannot be the next step.
- **Discovery (B):** This TTP is about identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent activities. While it could be a step, it doesn't directly relate to the next action of tracking hosts.
- **Command and Control (C):** This TTP involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the capability to direct the compromised system. The related techniques (T1102-Web Service and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer) are directly related to Command and Control.
- **Exfiltration (D):** This TTP is about transferring data from the target system to the attacker. It doesn't fit the sequence as it comes after tracking infected hosts.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The payload has been downloaded and executed.
- The next logical step would be to establish a means of Command and Control to manage the compromised system.
- The related TTPs (T1102-Web Service and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer) are directly related to Command and Control.
- Tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org would come after establishing Command and Control.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C**
