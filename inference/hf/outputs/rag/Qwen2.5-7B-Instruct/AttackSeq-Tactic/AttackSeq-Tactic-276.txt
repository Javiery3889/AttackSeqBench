Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before FIN8 conducted domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and gathered system information with `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves discovering domain trust relationships, which is the action FIN8 is performing.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the gathering of system information using `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network. While persistence is crucial for long-term access, it is not directly related to the specific actions of domain trust discovery and system information gathering.
- **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. While lateral movement can be a part of an attack, it is not the initial step that precedes domain trust discovery and system information gathering.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources needed for an attack. It is not directly related to the specific actions of domain trust discovery and system information gathering.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying the target and its resources. The techniques T1482-Domain Trust Discovery and T1018-Remote System Discovery are both part of the Discovery tactic. Therefore, the actions of domain trust discovery and system information gathering are part of the Discovery tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks which tactic most likely occurred before the specific actions of domain trust discovery and system information gathering.
- The related TTPs indicate that these actions are part of the Discovery tactic.
- Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before these actions is also Discovery.

### Final Answer: D
