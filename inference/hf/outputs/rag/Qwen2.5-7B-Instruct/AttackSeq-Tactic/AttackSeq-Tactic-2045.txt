Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Iron Tiger gained access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers through a supply chain attack. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide information about the initial access technique used, which is a supply chain attack. The techniques mentioned are:
- T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
- T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
- T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence described:

- **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing resources to support their operations, such as tools, infrastructure, or stolen data. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the immediate actions after gaining access.
- **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the compromised system. Given that the question mentions compromising servers, exfiltration is a logical next step after gaining access.
- **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker's first step in gaining access to a network or system. Since the question states that Iron Tiger has already gained access, this is not the next step.
- **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the attacker avoiding detection by the defender. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after gaining access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where Iron Tiger has already gained access to the backend and compromised the servers.
- The next logical step after gaining access and compromising the servers would be to extract the data or information that was stolen.
- Exfiltration (Answer B) is the most plausible next step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
