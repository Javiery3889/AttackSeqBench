Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that the attacker has already established command and control (C2) channels. The next step in the attack sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur to complete the mission successfully.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple channels to maintain C2.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves having alternative communication channels in case the primary C2 channel is compromised.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the established C2 channels and the goal of completing the mission successfully.

- **A: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. While it is a critical step in many attacks, it is not directly related to maintaining C2 channels.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the attacker has established C2 channels. However, the question asks for the next step to complete the mission successfully.
- **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a crucial step, it is not directly related to maintaining C2 channels.
- **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. While it is important, it is not directly related to maintaining C2 channels.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given that the attacker has already established C2 channels, the next logical step to ensure the mission's success would be to ensure the reliability and resilience of these channels. The related TTPs mention techniques for maintaining C2 channels, such as using multi-stage and fallback channels.

- **A: Exfiltration** and **C: Collection** are not directly related to maintaining C2 channels.
- **D: Defense Evasion** is about avoiding detection, not maintaining C2 channels.
- **B: Command and Control** is already established, but the question asks for the next step to ensure the mission's success.

The most plausible next step to ensure the mission's success is to ensure the reliability and resilience of the C2 channels, which aligns with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
