Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before deploying Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to execute a .NET injector for command execution and privilege escalation in the WastedLocker ransomware campaign.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool** - This suggests that the attackers developed or obtained tools, which could include Cobalt Strike.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This indicates the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the question's mention of using PowerShell to execute a .NET injector.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Execution** - This tactic involves the use of tools and techniques to run malicious code. While PowerShell is used for execution, the question specifically asks about what occurred before deploying Cobalt Strike.
- **B: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While privilege escalation is a part of the overall attack, it is not the first step in the sequence described.
- **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. This is a logical first step before deploying any tools or executing malicious code.
- **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the actual damage or effect of the attack, such as data exfiltration or ransomware deployment. This is the final step, not the first.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions leading up to the deployment of Cobalt Strike and the execution of a .NET injector.
- The first step in this sequence would logically be gathering information about the target environment, which is the purpose of reconnaissance.
- After gathering the necessary information, the attackers would then deploy Cobalt Strike and use PowerShell to execute the .NET injector for command execution and privilege escalation.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
