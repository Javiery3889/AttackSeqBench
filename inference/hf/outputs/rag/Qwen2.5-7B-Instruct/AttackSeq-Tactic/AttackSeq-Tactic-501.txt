Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where TA505 first exploited a vulnerability (SolarWinds Serv-U) to gain initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence is the hijacking of the RegIdleBackup scheduled task for maintaining persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic is relevant as it describes the method used to gain initial access to the network, which is the first step mentioned in the question.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** This tactic is relevant as it describes the method used to maintain access to the network, which is the second step mentioned in the question (hijacking the RegIdleBackup scheduled task).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution** - This tactic is not directly related to the sequence described. Execution typically involves running code or scripts, which is not the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This is the first step mentioned in the question, but the question asks for the tactic that followed initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development** - This tactic is not directly related to the sequence described. Resource development typically involves gathering information and resources, which is not the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic is not directly related to the sequence described. Command and control involves establishing a channel for communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is not the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice E: Persistence** - This tactic is directly related to the sequence described. After gaining initial access, the next step is to maintain that access, which is exactly what the hijacking of the RegIdleBackup scheduled task represents.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the first step is gaining initial access, and the next step is maintaining that access through persistence.
   - The related TTPs confirm that the tactic of Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) is relevant to the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the tactic of Persistence follows Initial Access.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
