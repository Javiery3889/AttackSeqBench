Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Attackers used the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes.
2. They prepared collected intellectual property for exfiltration.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials**: This technique involves dumping cached domain credentials, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the second part of the question (preparing intellectual property for exfiltration).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which tactic describes maintaining communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data loss or system damage. It does not describe maintaining communication.
- **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic is about transferring data from the target to an external location. While it involves data transfer, it does not describe maintaining communication.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining a channel to control the compromised system. This aligns with the need to receive commands and retrieve binary code.
- **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While it can involve communication, it does not specifically describe the channel for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on maintaining communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
- The related TTPs do not directly mention maintaining communication but align with the initial steps of the attack.
- Among the answer choices, **Command and Control** (C) is the most relevant tactic as it directly describes the need to maintain a channel for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
