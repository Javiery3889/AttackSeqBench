Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Darkhotel APT:
1. Evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors.
2. Encrypting gathered data in log files.
3. Targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique is directly related to the third action in the question, which is targeting stored secrets and credentials from browsers.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique is related to the first action in the question, which is evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique is related to the second action in the question, which is encrypting gathered data in log files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs:

- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems. While it could be part of an APT campaign, it does not directly align with the specific actions described in the question.
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. The question mentions evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypting data, which aligns with this tactic. However, it does not fully capture the third action of targeting stored secrets and credentials.
- **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a network or system over time. While persistence could be a part of the campaign, it does not directly align with the specific actions described in the question.
- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or data. The question specifically mentions targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include evading detection, encrypting data, and targeting stored secrets and credentials.
- The related TTPs confirm that the third action (targeting stored secrets and credentials) is part of the Credential Access tactic.
- The other actions (evading detection and encrypting data) are part of the Defense Evasion tactic, but they do not fully capture the third action.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
