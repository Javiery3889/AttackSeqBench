Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the KerrDown DLL is dropped in a directory and executed in memory. The next step involves downloading the final payload from a URL. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to be associated with this action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a DLL into memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with the execution of the KerrDown DLL in memory.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for execution, which is not directly related to the download of the final payload from a URL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic is not directly related to downloading a payload from a URL.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: While this tactic is mentioned in the related TTPs, it does not directly address the download of the final payload.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is relevant to downloading a payload from a URL.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying and gathering information about the target environment, which is not directly related to downloading a payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the download of a final payload from a URL, which is a key action in the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
- The related TTPs do not provide direct evidence for Credential Access, Defense Evasion, or Discovery.
- Command and Control (C2) is the most relevant tactic for the described action of downloading a payload from a URL.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
