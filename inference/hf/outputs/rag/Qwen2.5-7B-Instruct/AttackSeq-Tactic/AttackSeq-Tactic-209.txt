Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already used defense evasion techniques such as switching external templates and using digitally signed payloads. The next step involves the Bandook loader injecting a malicious payload and establishing communication with the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**, **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** (Technique)
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**, **T1221-Template Injection** (Technique)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic is already mentioned in the question and is not the next step in the sequence.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves the establishment of a channel for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system. The question states that the next step is the Bandook loader establishing communication with the C2 server, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the compromised system over time. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after the injection of a malicious payload.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It is not directly related to the immediate next step of establishing communication with the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already used defense evasion techniques.
- The next step involves the Bandook loader injecting a malicious payload, which is a step towards establishing a channel for communication.
- The immediate next step after the injection of a malicious payload is the establishment of communication with the C2 server, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: B**
