Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attack group conducted reconnaissance through phishing domains and before they established alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This indicates that the attack group was gathering information about the victim.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link in a phishing email to gain initial access to the victim's system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which typically occurs after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information, which is already mentioned as having occurred through phishing domains.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the victim's system, which is also mentioned as having occurred through spearphishing.
- **Answer Choice D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system, which is mentioned as occurring after the initial access.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attack group conducted reconnaissance through phishing domains, which is already covered by the related TTPs.
2. **Initial Access**: The attack group used spearphishing to gain initial access to the victim's system, which is also covered by the related TTPs.
3. **Persistence**: The question asks for the tactic that occurs after initial access and before persistence. Credential access is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs provided, and persistence is the final step in the sequence.

### Final Answer: 
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the tactic that occurs after initial access and before persistence. Given the options and the context, the most appropriate answer is:

Final Answer: C: Persistence
