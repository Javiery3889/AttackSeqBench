Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers first gain initial access through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - The attackers then manage three separate campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over their victims.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and specifically mention "Spearphishing Link" as a technique under Initial Access.
   - This indicates that the initial phase of the attack involves gaining access through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of extracting data from a network or system. While it is a critical step in many cyber attacks, it does not directly follow the initial access phase described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the tactic that describes the methods used to initially gain a foothold in a network. The question mentions spear-phishing and targeted Facebook attacks, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about the target. While it is a crucial step, it typically follows the initial access phase and does not directly describe the maintenance of control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that describes the methods used to maintain control over a compromised system. The question mentions managing three separate campaigns with different C&C/IPs, which aligns with the C2 tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question starts with gaining initial access through spear-phishing and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - The attackers then manage multiple campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control.
   - The related TTPs confirm that Initial Access is the tactic that includes spear-phishing, which is the first step in the sequence.
   - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that describes maintaining control, which is the final step in the sequence.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
