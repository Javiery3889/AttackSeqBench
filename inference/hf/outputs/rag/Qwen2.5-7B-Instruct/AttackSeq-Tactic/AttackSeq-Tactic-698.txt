Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
1. They used dumpers on victim machines to retrieve credential-related databases.
2. They scanned the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.

We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the credential-related databases were retrieved but before the scanning of the local system, network shared drives, and removable media.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide the following information:
- **Collection**: T1005-Data from Local System, T1119-Automated Collection
- **Credential Access**: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is not directly related to the actions described. It involves identifying and classifying resources and capabilities, which does not align with the specific actions of retrieving credential-related databases and scanning for file extensions.

- **Answer Choice B: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information and data from various sources. The actions of using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases and scanning for specific file extensions are both forms of data collection. However, the question specifies that the scanning occurred after the credential-related databases were retrieved, so Collection is a plausible tactic but not the most specific one.

- **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
  - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials from a target. The use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases is a clear example of Credential Access. This tactic directly aligns with the first action described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining the operational security of a command and control channel. This does not align with the actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases, which is a clear example of Credential Access.
- The scanning of the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions is a form of Collection.
- The Credential Access tactic (T1003-OS Credential Dumping) directly aligns with the first action described in the question.

### Final Answer: C: Credential Access
