Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting vulnerabilities via malicious RTF documents or Excel spreadsheets to gain initial access.
2. Using AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 host and hide their identity.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making the C2 infrastructure appear as legitimate to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using malicious attachments (like RTF documents or Excel spreadsheets) to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - The question mentions using AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to the C2 host, which aligns with the T1665-Hide Infrastructure technique under the Command and Control tactic.
- **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
  - While persistence is a common tactic, the question focuses on the initial actions and the C2 infrastructure, which align more closely with Command and Control.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
  - The initial access part of the question is covered by the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique, but the question asks about the actions after gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes actions after gaining initial access, which is covered by the Command and Control tactic.
- The use of AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to the C2 host and hide the identity aligns with the T1665-Hide Infrastructure technique.
- The related TTPs confirm that Command and Control is the relevant tactic for the described actions.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
