Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. Anti-analysis techniques were used.
2. Data was gathered on the victim's computer, including kernel information and anti-virus presence.
3. The backdoor's capabilities were not yet utilized to collect extensive system data like file and process information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about security software on the target system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the question's mention of extensive system data like file and process information.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the question's mention of kernel information and anti-virus presence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which aligns with the actions described in the question (gathering kernel information and anti-virus presence).
  - However, the question specifies that the backdoor's capabilities have not yet been utilized to collect extensive system data, which suggests that the next step would be to use the backdoor to gather more detailed information.

- **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
  - This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources needed to execute the attack, which does not directly align with the actions described in the question.

- **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
  - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system, which also does not directly align with the actions described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system, which aligns with the question's mention of extensive system data like file and process information. However, the question specifies that the backdoor's capabilities have not yet been utilized, so this is likely the next step after the initial data gathering.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers first used anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection.
- They then gathered data on the victim's computer, including kernel information and anti-virus presence, which aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.
- The next logical step would be to use the backdoor's capabilities to collect more extensive system data, which aligns with the **Collection** tactic.

### Final Answer: D
