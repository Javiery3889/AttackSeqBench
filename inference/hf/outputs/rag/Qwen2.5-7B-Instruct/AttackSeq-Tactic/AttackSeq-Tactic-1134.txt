Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious MFC Dialog application is executed, and it uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with the execution of a DLL file into memory.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process's address space without the need for the DLL to be present on the disk, which is relevant to the execution of a DLL file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the execution of a DLL file.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. It is not directly related to the execution of a DLL file.
- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target system. It is a prerequisite for any further actions, including the execution of a DLL file.
- **D: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The question already describes the execution of a DLL file, so this is not the preceding step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of a DLL file (described in the question) is a result of the attacker gaining initial access to the system.
- The techniques mentioned (T1620-Reflective Code Loading and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) are used to load the DLL into memory, which is a step in the execution process.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access occurred before the execution of the DLL file.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
