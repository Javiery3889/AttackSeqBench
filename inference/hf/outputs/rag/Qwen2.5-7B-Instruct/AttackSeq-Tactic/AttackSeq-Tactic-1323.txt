Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies.
2. This manipulation happened before intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This technique involves stealing web session cookies, which aligns with the manipulation of session keys and cookies.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking browser sessions, which could be a method to intercept HTTPS POST requests.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the manipulation of session keys and cookies but before intercepting HTTPS POST requests.

- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about avoiding defensive measures, which doesn't fit the sequence described.
- **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the network or system, which would be the first step, not after manipulating session keys and cookies.
- **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the network or system, which could be relevant but doesn't fit the sequence as well as Collection.
- **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which aligns well with intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Manipulation of Session Keys and Cookies**: This is a technique under Credential Access.
2. **Collection of Data**: Intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials is a technique under Collection.
3. **Sequence Analysis**: The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the manipulation but before the collection. Collection is the most logical step after manipulating session keys and cookies to intercept and steal credentials.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
