Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Credential dumping using Mimikatz.
2. Executing reconnaissance commands to discover remote systems, user accounts, and network topology.
3. Leveraging the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems using webshells.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access** - This includes techniques like T1003.001 (LSASS Memory) and T1003.006 (DCSync), which are related to obtaining credentials.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement** - This involves moving from one system to another using the obtained credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving from one system to another using the obtained credentials. The question mentions using the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems, which aligns with the definition of Lateral Movement.
- **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
  - This tactic involves gathering information about the target network. While reconnaissance is part of the initial phase, the question focuses on the use of credentials to execute commands on other systems, which is more aligned with Lateral Movement.
- **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
  - This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While this is a part of the initial phase, the question moves beyond just obtaining credentials to using them to execute commands on other systems.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying the network and systems. While discovery is part of the reconnaissance phase, the question focuses on the use of credentials to execute commands on other systems, which is more aligned with Lateral Movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that starts with credential dumping and reconnaissance, but the core action is using the obtained credentials to execute commands on other systems.
- The related TTPs specifically mention Lateral Movement as the tactic that involves moving from one system to another using the obtained credentials.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement
