Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer are exploited for execution. After this initial exploitation, the attackers conduct an extensive search within the compromised networks for intellectual property and vulnerable systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique is directly related to the initial exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique is related to gaining higher privileges, which is a step that might occur after the initial execution but before the discovery of intellectual property.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
  - Persistence is about maintaining access to the network. While it is a common tactic after gaining access, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation or the search for intellectual property.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
  - Defense Evasion is about avoiding detection by the defender. This could be a tactic used at various points in the attack, but it is not directly related to the search for intellectual property.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) is about establishing and maintaining channels for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is important, it is not directly related to the search for intellectual property.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - Discovery is about identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. This aligns well with the described action of searching for intellectual property and vulnerable systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer (T1203) is a clear step in the sequence.
- After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to escalate their privileges (T1068) to have more capabilities within the network.
- The next logical step would be to discover and search for intellectual property and other valuable assets (T1033, which is a sub-technique of Discovery).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes the discovery of intellectual property and vulnerable systems.

**Final Answer: D**
