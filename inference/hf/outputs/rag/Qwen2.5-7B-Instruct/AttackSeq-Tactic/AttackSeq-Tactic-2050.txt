Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an XAgent app is executed on iOS devices, collects data (such as geo-location and text messages), and then sends this data via HTTP POST requests to a C2 server. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining perishable channels with the target to deliver commands and exfiltrate data.
- **Exfiltration (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary extracting and moving data from the target environment.
- **Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel.
- **Technique T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted protocol that is not a command and control channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (A):** This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the network and systems. It does not directly relate to the data exfiltration process.
- **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials. While this could be a precursor to data exfiltration, it is not directly related to the data collection and exfiltration process described.
- **Privilege Escalation (C):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining higher-level access to the system. It is not directly related to the data exfiltration process.
- **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels to deliver commands and exfiltrate data. The question mentions that the data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a C2 server, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the data being sent via HTTP POST requests to a C2 server, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
- The related TTPs specifically mention Command and Control techniques, such as T1071.001-Web Protocols, which align with the HTTP POST requests.
- The exfiltration techniques (T1041 and T1048) are related to the data being sent, but they do not describe the initial setup of the channel.

### Final Answer: D
