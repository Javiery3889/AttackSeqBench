Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold in victim networks. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial deployment.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence** - This tactic involves the methods an attacker uses to maintain access to a network or system.
- **Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell** - This technique involves the use of web shells to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods an attacker uses to initially gain access to a network or system.
- **Technique: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique involves the use of external remote services to gain access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: After deploying web shells and custom malware, the next logical step would be to ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the network. Persistence techniques are designed to keep the attacker's presence undetected and ongoing.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the methods used to run or install malware. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the deployment of web shells and malware.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the methods used to find and identify assets and data of interest. This would likely occur before the initial deployment of web shells and malware.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves the methods used to obtain credentials. While this is important, it is also a step that would typically occur before the initial deployment of web shells and malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the deployment of web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold. This is a step in the attack lifecycle.
- After establishing a foothold, the next logical step is to ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the network. This aligns with the Persistence tactic.
- The related TTPs mention T1505.003-Web Shell, which is a persistence technique.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
