Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events:
1. Malicious emails containing trojaned attachments were sent to Tibetan organizations.
2. An unknown tactic occurred after the emails were sent.
3. 'Surtr' malware was executed by injecting itself into a newly created explorer or iexplore process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This suggests that the malware is delivered via a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This indicates that the malware is executed by injecting itself into a process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred after the emails were sent and before the malware was executed by process injection.

- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is about gathering resources for an attack, which does not fit the sequence as it would occur before the initial access.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**
  - This tactic aligns with the sequence as it involves the execution of the malware. However, the question specifies that the execution involves process injection, which is a sub-technique under Execution.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Impact**
  - This tactic is about the effects of the attack, which would occur after the malware is executed. It does not fit the sequence as it comes after the execution.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
  - This tactic involves gaining access to the target environment, which would occur before the emails are sent. It does not fit the sequence as it comes before the emails.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The emails containing trojaned attachments are a form of Initial Access, but this occurs before the emails are sent.
- The emails are sent, and then the malware is delivered via a malicious file, which is part of the Execution tactic.
- The malware is then executed by injecting itself into a process, which is a sub-technique under Execution.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the emails were sent and before the malware was executed by process injection is Execution.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
