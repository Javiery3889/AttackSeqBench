To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where Cobalt Strike beacon is used to map the internal network and compromise additional endpoints. The next step is to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely preceded the lateral movement efforts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally within a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic is about developing resources to support the adversary's objectives. It does not directly relate to the immediate actions of mapping the network and compromising additional endpoints.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic is about avoiding detection by the defender. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly precede the mapping and compromising of endpoints.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is a common precursor to lateral movement as it allows the adversary to move to other systems.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target environment. This is closely related to mapping the network and identifying additional endpoints.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Mapping the Network**: The adversary uses Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network, which is a form of discovery.
- **Compromising Endpoints**: After mapping, the adversary compromises additional endpoints. This could involve credential access to gain initial footholds.
- **Lateral Movement**: The next step is to move laterally to other workstations, which is facilitated by credential access and discovery.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that precedes the lateral movement efforts is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer: C
