Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Elfin extracted credentials using DarkComet and before data was exfiltrated using the custom AutoIt FTP tool FastUploader.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as having occurred (Elfin extracted credentials using DarkComet). Therefore, this cannot be the next step.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target system. While this is a common step after credential access, it is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing a means to control the compromised system. This is also a common step but not directly related to the exfiltration process.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary initially gaining access to the target system. This is the first step in an attack sequence and does not fit the context of the question.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the tactic that directly follows the extraction of credentials and precedes the exfiltration of data. The related TTPs provided are both under the Exfiltration tactic, which aligns with the question's focus on data exfiltration.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the Exfiltration tactic. However, since the question asks for a specific answer choice and none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) directly match "Exfiltration," we need to choose the closest match.

- **A: Credential Access** - This is the initial step, not the next step after credential extraction.
- **B: Persistence** - This is a common step but not directly related to exfiltration.
- **C: Command and Control** - This is a common step but not directly related to exfiltration.
- **D: Initial Access** - This is the first step, not the next step after credential extraction.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the closest match is:

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
