Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Persistent collection of credentials.
2. Preparation of credentials for transmission every hour.
3. Establishment of a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Exfiltration (Tactic)**: This is relevant because the question mentions uploading stolen credentials to an external FTP server.
- **Collection (Tactic)**: This is relevant because the question mentions persistent collection of credentials.
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic)**: This is less directly relevant to the specific actions described in the question.
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: This is relevant because it involves the mechanism to upload the stolen credentials, which can be seen as a form of C2.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
  - This is not directly related to the actions described in the question. Resource Development typically involves the development of tools, techniques, or resources, which is not the focus here.
- **Answer Choice B: Collection**
  - This is directly related to the persistent collection of credentials, which is the first part of the sequence.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
  - While reconnaissance might be involved in gathering initial information, it is not the primary tactic in the sequence described.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - This is relevant because it involves the mechanism to upload the stolen credentials, which can be seen as a form of C2. However, the primary focus is on the exfiltration of data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves persistent collection of credentials (Collection TTP) and then uploading them to an external FTP server (Exfiltration TTP).
- The most relevant tactic here is **Exfiltration** because it directly addresses the action of uploading the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.
- While Command and Control is also involved, the primary focus of the question is on the exfiltration of data.

### Final Answer: D (Command and Control) is the most plausible answer, but the primary tactic is Exfiltration. However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and Command and Control is the closest match among the given choices, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D (Command and Control)
