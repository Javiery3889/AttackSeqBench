Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious Android video application is downloaded after a phishing page is created.
   - The phishing page is disguised as a download page, which is a form of social engineering.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves using a malicious link to deliver malware or perform other malicious actions.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system without their interaction, often through a malicious website.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a targeted phishing email with a malicious link.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's environment. The creation of a phishing page and the use of a malicious link are methods of initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement (A):** This tactic involves moving from the initial point of compromise to other parts of the network. This does not fit the scenario as the question is about the initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance (B):** This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack, the question specifically mentions the creation of a phishing page, which is a method of initial access.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing channels for the adversary to communicate with the compromised system. This is not the first step in the scenario described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described in the question, is the initial access through the creation of a phishing page and the use of a malicious link.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is C: Initial Access.

Final Answer: C: Initial Access
