Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers:
1. Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports.
2. Created public registry accounts mimicking popular software or packages.
3. Tricked developers into pulling and running malicious container images.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports)
- **Defense Evasion**: T1612-Build Image on Host (creating and deploying malicious images)
- **Execution**: T1204.003-Malicious Image (running the malicious container images)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
  - This TTP is related to creating or modifying domain accounts, which does not align with the described attack sequence.

- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This TTP involves compromising a supply chain to deliver malicious software. While it fits the context of tricking developers into pulling and running malicious container images, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This TTP involves creating or modifying web services. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the initial exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.

- **D: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This TTP involves using voice-based spearphishing, which is not relevant to the described attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial step involves exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
- The next step involves creating public registry accounts that mimic popular software or packages (a form of supply chain compromise, but not directly listed).
- The final step involves tricking developers into pulling and running malicious container images (T1204.003-Malicious Image).

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is directly related to the creation and execution of the malicious container images.

### Final Answer: D
