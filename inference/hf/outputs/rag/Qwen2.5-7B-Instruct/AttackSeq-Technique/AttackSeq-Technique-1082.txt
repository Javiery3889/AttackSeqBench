Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery using SMBMap and system commands like `net user` and `tasklist.exe`.
2. Lateral movement by leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement**: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares
- **Privilege Escalation**: T1078.002-Domain Accounts
- **Discovery**: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
  - This technique involves using remote management protocols, which is not directly related to the described actions of discovery and leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

- **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, which is not directly related to the described actions of discovery and leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

- **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
  - This technique involves manipulating accounts, which could be related to leveraging compromised privileged accounts. However, it does not directly address the lateral movement aspect.

- **D: T1137.001-Office Template Macros**
  - This technique involves using Office template macros, which is not directly related to the described actions of discovery and leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described actions of discovery and leveraging compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement is:

- **T1078.002-Domain Accounts** (for privilege escalation) and **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares** (for lateral movement).

However, since the question asks for a single answer choice, the closest match to leveraging compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement is:

**Final Answer: C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
