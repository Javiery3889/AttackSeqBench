### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Welcome Chat app exfiltrated various types of data (SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recorded calls, and GPS data) from a victim device.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the exfiltration of various types of data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is relevant to the exfiltration process.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves using messaging applications to collect data, which is relevant to the use of the Welcome Chat app.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1614-System Location Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the location of a system, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of the described data types.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of the described data types.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which could be relevant to the exfiltration process but is not the most direct follow-up to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves tunneling data through a protocol, which is relevant to the exfiltration process, especially if the data is being sent over a C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the exfiltration of various types of data, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the use of a protocol to tunnel the exfiltrated data. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after the exfiltration is T1572-Protocol Tunneling.

**Final Answer: D**
