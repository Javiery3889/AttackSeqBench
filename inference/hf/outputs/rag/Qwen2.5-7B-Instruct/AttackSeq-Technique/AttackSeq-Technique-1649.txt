### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PurpleFox uses an MSI package to install a rootkit driver and blocks incoming connections via a firewall rule.
   - The goal is to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**: This technique involves modifying or disabling the system firewall to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. However, the question specifically asks about bidirectional communication, and web services are not typically used for this purpose.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to control the flow of traffic, which is not directly related to establishing a bidirectional communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, it does not directly establish a bidirectional communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1014-Rootkit**: This technique involves using a rootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection. However, it does not directly establish a bidirectional communication channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**.

**Final Answer: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
