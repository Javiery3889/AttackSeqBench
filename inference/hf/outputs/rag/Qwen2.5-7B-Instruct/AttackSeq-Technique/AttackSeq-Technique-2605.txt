### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where NanHaiShu establishes persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry to autostart `network.js`.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to evade defensive mechanisms and process obfuscated or encoded data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques related to persistence and evasion, specifically:
     - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves using registry keys to ensure a malicious process starts automatically.
     - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring a malicious process starts automatically at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
     - This technique involves using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to boot a system. It does not directly relate to evading defensive mechanisms or processing obfuscated data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using protocols other than those typically used for application data to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to evading defensive mechanisms or processing obfuscated data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it can be used to execute malicious code, it does not specifically address evading defensive mechanisms or processing obfuscated data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding from files or information to make them usable. This directly addresses the scenario of processing obfuscated or encoded data, which is likely to be part of evading defensive mechanisms.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the technique that directly addresses the processing of obfuscated or encoded data to evade defensive mechanisms.

**Final Answer: D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
