### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers gather detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collect system details for assessment during the discovery phase.
   - The focus is on the surveillance objectives related to data acquisition from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," and the technique is "T1082-System Information Discovery."
   - This indicates that the attackers are gathering information about the victim's system during the initial reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1070.003-Clear Command History**
     - This technique involves clearing command history to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to data acquisition or surveillance.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves removing obfuscation from files or information. It is not directly related to the initial data collection phase but rather to processing or analyzing collected data.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which is a step that might occur after data has been gathered. However, it is not the immediate action following the data collection.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves acquiring data from the local system, which aligns with the initial data collection phase described in the question. It directly relates to the surveillance objectives of gathering system details.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **T1005-Data from Local System**.

Final Answer: D
