### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying a backdoor component (`advstoreshell.dll`) during data collection.
   - The key aspects are:
     - Secure communication
     - Post-deployment (after data collection)
     - C&C servers

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**:
     - This technique involves transferring data at a scheduled time, which is relevant to data collection but not directly to secure communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**:
     - This technique involves maintaining a bidirectional communication channel, which is relevant to secure communication with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**:
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is compromised, which is also relevant to secure communication but not as directly related to the post-deployment secure communication as T1102.002.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**:
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers, which is directly about secure communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1569-System Services**:
     - This technique involves using system services for persistence, which is not directly related to secure communication.
   - **B: T1071.001-Web Protocols**:
     - This technique involves using web protocols for data exfiltration, which is more about exfiltration than secure communication.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**:
     - This technique directly involves using encrypted channels for secure communication, which aligns well with the question's requirement for secure communication with C&C servers.
   - **D: T1218.014-MMC**:
     - This technique involves using Management and Monitoring Console (MMC) for command and control, which is not as directly related to secure communication as T1573.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll` during data collection is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

Final Answer: C
