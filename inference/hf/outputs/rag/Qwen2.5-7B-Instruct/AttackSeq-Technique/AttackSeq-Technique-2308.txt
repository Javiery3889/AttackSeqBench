### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary first attempts to clean up traces of their intrusions (clearing Windows event logs) and then uses PsLogList for discovery.
   - We need to identify the TTP that logically occurs between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" and specifically "T1070-Indicator Removal" and "T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs."
   - T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs is the action of cleaning up traces, which aligns with the question's first part.
   - T1070-Indicator Removal is a broader category that includes T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access** - This technique is not directly related to the actions of cleaning up traces or using PsLogList for discovery.
   - **B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft** - This technique involves stealing or impersonating tokens, which is not directly related to the described actions.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** - This technique involves exploiting remote services, which is not directly related to the described actions.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique is a broader category that includes the action of clearing Windows event logs (T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs). It also encompasses other actions that might be taken to remove indicators of compromise, which could logically precede the use of PsLogList for discovery.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
