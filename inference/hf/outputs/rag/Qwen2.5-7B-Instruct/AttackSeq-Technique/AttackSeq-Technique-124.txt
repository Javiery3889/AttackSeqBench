Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. Wipers (destructive malware) like 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' were deployed.
2. Agrius used the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP for coordinating further actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This is relevant as it involves communication with C2 servers.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the HTTP communication mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Impact**: This is relevant as it involves destructive actions.
- **Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves destroying data, which aligns with the use of wipers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This technique involves using the `regsvcs` or `regasm` command to register or unregister COM+ components. It does not directly relate to the C2 communication or data destruction mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**: This technique involves flooding a service with requests to exhaust its resources. While it can be a form of impact, it does not directly relate to the C2 communication or data destruction mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to make it unusable, which aligns with the data destruction aspect but does not directly relate to the C2 communication.
- **D: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to perform actions, which aligns with the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for C2 communication over HTTP, which aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.
- The related TTPs also mention the Tactic: Command and Control, which is relevant to the C2 communication.
- The question also mentions the use of wipers, which aligns with the T1485-Data Destruction technique.
- Among the answer choices, T1021-Remote Services (D) is the most relevant to the C2 communication aspect of the question.

### Final Answer: D
