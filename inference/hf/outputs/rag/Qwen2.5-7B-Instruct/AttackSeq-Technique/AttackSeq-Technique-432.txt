Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an AutoIt downloader uses WMI objects to perform reconnaissance and gather process lists during victim system discovery. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial reconnaissance phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering services running on the target system.
- **Tactic: Execution**
  - **Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**: This technique involves using WMI to execute code or gather information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering peripheral devices on the target system. It is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance using WMI and process lists.
- **Option B: T1547.015-Login Items**
  - This technique involves adding items to the list of items that are executed when a user logs in. It is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance using WMI and process lists.
- **Option C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance using WMI and process lists. After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to further discover more details about the system.
- **Option D: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
  - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains. It is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance using WMI and process lists.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial TTP involves using WMI to gather process lists and perform reconnaissance.
- The next logical step after gathering system information would be to further discover more details about the system, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.

### Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery
