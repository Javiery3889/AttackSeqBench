### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique used by the CostaRicto Campaign, which involves creating remote tunnels via SSH tools and executing payload stagers with scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "External Remote Services," which aligns with the use of SSH tools for remote tunneling.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves using legitimate identities to perform actions that are not typically associated with initial access or remote tunneling.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be part of an initial access strategy, it does not directly relate to the use of SSH tools for remote tunneling.
   - **C: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering running processes on a system. It is more relevant to post-exploitation activities rather than initial access.
   - **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing to gain access to a system. However, the question specifically mentions the use of SSH tools, which is not directly related to spearphishing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for the initial access technique that involves creating remote tunnels via SSH tools is not directly listed in the provided answer choices. However, the closest and most relevant technique to the use of SSH tools for remote tunneling in the context of initial access is not explicitly listed. Given the options, none of the choices perfectly match the described TTPs, but if we must choose the most plausible based on the provided options, **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service** (D) is the closest, as it involves a method of gaining initial access, even though it does not directly involve SSH tools.

### Final Answer: D
