Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Visitors to compromised websites were exposed to browser fingerprinting exploits.
2. Malicious scripts communicated with C&C servers using HTTPS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains**: This technique involves acquiring domain names.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This technique involves setting up a drive-by target, which can be a compromised website.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to visitors.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly involve acquiring domain names or setting up infrastructure.
- **Answer Choice B: T1561-Disk Wipe**: This technique involves erasing data from a disk. It is not relevant to the attack sequence described.
- **Answer Choice C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique involves acquiring or setting up infrastructure to support the attack, which aligns with the context of acquiring domain names and renting servers.
- **Answer Choice D: T1584.006-Web Services**: This technique involves using web services to support the attack, but it does not directly involve acquiring domain names or setting up infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the setup of a drive-by attack, where domain names and servers are acquired to support the attack.
- The related TTPs mention acquiring domain names (T1584.001-Domains) and setting up a drive-by target (T1608.004-Drive-by Target).
- The technique that best fits the context of acquiring domain names and setting up infrastructure is T1583-Acquire Infrastructure.

### Final Answer: C
