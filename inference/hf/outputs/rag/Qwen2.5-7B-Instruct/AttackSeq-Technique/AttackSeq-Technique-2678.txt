Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ZoxPNG establishes communication with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files.
2. ZoxPNG then registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control. This aligns with the part of the question where ZoxPNG uses HTTP GET and POST requests.
- **T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data (like hiding commands within PNG files). This also aligns with the part of the question where PNG files are used to contain commands.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
The question asks about the technique that occurs when ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch. This part of the sequence is more about the actual communication and handling of commands, rather than the initial establishment of the communication channel.

- **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native system APIs to perform actions. While it could be relevant, it is not directly related to the communication and command dispatch part of the sequence.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique is directly related to the communication part, but it is more about the initial establishment of the channel rather than the command handling.
- **T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique is more relevant to the part where commands are hidden within PNG files, which is a part of the initial establishment of the communication channel.
- **T1106-Native API**: This technique is not directly related to the communication and command dispatch part of the sequence.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the command handling and dispatch part of the sequence is T1106-Native API, as it involves the actual execution and handling of commands.

### Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
