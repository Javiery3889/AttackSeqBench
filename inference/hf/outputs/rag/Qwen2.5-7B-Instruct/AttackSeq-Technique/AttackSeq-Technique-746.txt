### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a fraudulent website.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and techniques such as "T1189-Drive-by Compromise" and "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link."
   - These techniques are consistent with the scenario of gaining initial access through a fraudulent website and tricking users into downloading a fake app.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves creating or modifying system services to maintain persistence. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial access or the immediate actions after gaining access.
   - **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. It is a common step after gaining access but is not the most immediate action after initial access.
   - **C: T1569.002-Service Execution:** This technique involves executing a service to maintain persistence. It is a step that could follow gaining access but is not the most immediate action.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It is a step that could follow gaining access, but it is more about transferring tools rather than the immediate actions after gaining access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining initial access through a fake app, the next immediate action would likely be to discover and understand the environment to maintain access and move further.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** (B) is the most immediate and relevant technique after gaining access, as it involves understanding the environment and identifying potential targets or tools.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
