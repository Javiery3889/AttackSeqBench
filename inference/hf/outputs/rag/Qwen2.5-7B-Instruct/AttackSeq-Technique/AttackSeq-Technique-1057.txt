Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Darkhotel APT has already used advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations and stay details. The next step is to enable the maintenance of a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the target network.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to IP addresses, which is crucial for maintaining a dynamic network infrastructure.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1608.001-Upload Malware**: This technique involves uploading malware to a system. While this is a critical step in an attack, it does not directly address the maintenance of a dynamic network infrastructure.
- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate, which is important for maintaining stealth but does not directly address the dynamic network infrastructure.
- **C: T1584.002-DNS Server**: This technique involves compromising a DNS server, which can be used to redirect traffic and maintain control over the network. However, it is more about control over DNS rather than the dynamic network infrastructure itself.
- **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure to maintain long-term access. This aligns well with the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the APT has already gathered detailed information about the victims' locations and network details. The next step is to maintain a dynamic network infrastructure.
- The related TTPs indicate that the APT is focused on gathering network information and maintaining command and control.
- Among the answer choices, **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure** (D) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need to maintain a dynamic and global network infrastructure.

### Final Answer: D
