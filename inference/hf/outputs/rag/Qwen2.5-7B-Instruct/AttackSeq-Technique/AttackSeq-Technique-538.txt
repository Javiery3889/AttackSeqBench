Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a renamed `rundll32.exe` (as `ActiveFlash.exe`) is used for malicious actions.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is directly related to ensuring malware starts automatically during system boot or user logon. This technique is specifically designed to persist on the system.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32** is a technique used to execute code through the `rundll32.exe` utility, which is mentioned in the question. However, this technique alone does not ensure persistence.
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** and **T1546.002-Screensaver** are not directly related to ensuring automatic startup during system boot or user logon.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question asks for the technique that ensures the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.
   - The related TTPs mention T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, which is explicitly about ensuring malware starts automatically during system boot or user logon.
   - The other techniques do not align with the requirement of ensuring automatic startup.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
