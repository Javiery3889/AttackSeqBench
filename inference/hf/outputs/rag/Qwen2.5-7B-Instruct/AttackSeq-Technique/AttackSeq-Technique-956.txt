Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after exploiting vulnerabilities CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-21956 to achieve system-level access. The attackers then implemented Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules to facilitate communications with their C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation
- Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided information:

- **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain persistence and avoid detection. It aligns with the use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules to facilitate communications with the C&C server.

- **B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification**
  - This technique involves changing file and directory permissions to maintain persistence or hide malicious files. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware. It does not align with the described sequence of actions after achieving system-level access.

- **D: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding payloads to avoid detection by signature-based detection mechanisms. While it could be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not directly describe the use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions after achieving system-level access, which aligns with the Tactic of Privilege Escalation.
- The use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules to facilitate communications with the C&C server is a common technique for maintaining persistence and evading detection.
- Among the given choices, T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (A) best describes the use of multiple stages of communication to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
