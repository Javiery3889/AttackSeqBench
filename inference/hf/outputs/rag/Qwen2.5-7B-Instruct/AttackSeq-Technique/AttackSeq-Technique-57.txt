Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first use Emotet to send phishing emails to deliver Trickbot spyware. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the further delivery of malicious payloads after the initial phishing emails.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- T1566-Phishing

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending phishing emails, which is the initial step in the sequence described in the question. However, it does not specify the method of attachment or link, which is needed to deliver the payload.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a phishing email with an attachment. This is a plausible method for delivering a payload like Trickbot spyware.
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a phishing email with a link. While this can also be used to deliver a payload, the question does not specify a link, and the attachment method is more direct for delivering a file like spyware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attackers used Emotet to send over 500,000 phishing emails daily, which implies a large-scale operation.
- The subsequent step is the delivery of Trickbot spyware, which is a file-based malware.
- Among the options, T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is the most direct and plausible method for delivering a file-based payload like Trickbot spyware.

### Final Answer: B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
