Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FlowCloud has established persistence by installing components to a specified directory and configuring registry keys for keylogger drivers and malware configuration. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification**
  - This technique involves modifying code signing policies to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
  - This technique involves using registry run keys or startup folders to ensure the malware starts automatically when the system boots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the described sequence of actions:

- **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports to communicate with the C2 server. This is more related to communication and not directly related to the persistence or evasion techniques described.
  
- **B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, such as C2 servers or command and control (C2) channels. While this can be part of defense evasion, it is not directly related to the persistence or the actions described.
  
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules to reduce the footprint and evade detection. This can be part of defense evasion but is not directly related to the persistence or the actions described.
  
- **D: T1127.002-ClickOnce**
  - This technique involves using the ClickOnce deployment mechanism to deploy malware. This is more related to the initial compromise and not directly to the persistence or the actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve actions that directly follow the establishment of persistence. The related TTPs suggest that the next step could be related to further evading detection or ensuring the malware remains undetected.

- **T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification** (Defense Evasion) is a plausible next step as it helps the malware evade detection by modifying system policies.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** (Persistence) is already mentioned in the question and does not need to be the next step.

Among the given choices, **T1571-Non-Standard Port** (A) is the most plausible as it aligns with the tactic of evading detection by using non-standard ports for communication.

### Final Answer: A
