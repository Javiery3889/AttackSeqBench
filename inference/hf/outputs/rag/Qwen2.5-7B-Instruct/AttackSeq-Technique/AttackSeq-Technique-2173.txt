### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where spear phishing emails were sent to exploit Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the victim opened the OLE2 format attachments, leading to gaining initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is the technique used to send the spear phishing emails with OLE2 format attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's host, which is not directly related to the initial access or the spear phishing process.
   - **Option B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a broader category that includes T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. However, it does not specifically refer to the initial access phase.
   - **Option C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
     - Similar to T1592, this technique involves gathering network information, which is not directly related to the initial access or the spear phishing process.
   - **Option D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, which is not related to the initial access or the spear phishing process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that the attackers used T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment to send the spear phishing emails with OLE2 format attachments, which led to the victim opening the attachment and gaining initial access.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is already mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: B (T1566-Phishing)**

Note: While T1566 is the broader category, the specific spear phishing technique (T1566.001) is implied in the question. Thus, B is the most appropriate answer choice.
