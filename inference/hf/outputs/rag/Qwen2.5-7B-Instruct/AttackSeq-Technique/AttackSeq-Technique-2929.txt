Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT41:
1. Moving laterally within targeted networks.
2. Pivoting between Windows and Linux systems.
3. Collecting source code and digital certificates from game production environments.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic)**: This is directly related to moving between systems.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This includes code signing (T1553.002) which is relevant for collecting digital certificates.
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic)**: This includes credential harvesting (T1589.001) which is relevant for collecting source code and digital certificates.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before the collection of source code and digital certificates.

- **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves extracting data from information repositories. While it could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not directly related to the lateral movement or pivoting between systems.
- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots. It is not directly related to the collection of source code and digital certificates.
- **C: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to the collection of source code and digital certificates.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is a common method for credential harvesting, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: APT41 moves laterally within the network.
- **Step 2**: APT41 pivots between Windows and Linux systems.
- **Step 3**: APT41 needs to gather credentials and possibly other sensitive information to access game production environments.
- **Step 4**: Phishing (T1566) is a common method for gathering credentials, which fits the reconnaissance phase before collecting source code and digital certificates.

### Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
