### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious Firefox browser extension (FriarFox) is delivered via a phishing email.
   - The extension then contacts a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred when the extension contacted the server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence** and **Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions** indicate that the attacker is using a browser extension to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** and **Technique: T1036-Masquerading** suggest that the attacker is using techniques to avoid detection, such as disguising the extension as a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the communication between the extension and the server.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which is not directly related to the communication between the extension and the server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a remote server. This is directly relevant to the communication between the extension and the server.
   - **D: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking a session to a remote service, which is not directly related to the communication between the extension and the server.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: C
