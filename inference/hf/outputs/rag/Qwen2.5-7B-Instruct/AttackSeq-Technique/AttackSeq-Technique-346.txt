Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the threat actors have gained initial access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique. The next step in the attack sequence is to execute code using system services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying and enumerating processes to discover information about the system. While it could be a step in the attack, it does not directly involve executing code using system services.

- **B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**
  - This technique involves establishing persistence by modifying system services or scheduled tasks. This could be a step after gaining access, but it does not directly involve executing code using system services.

- **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**
  - This technique involves using scripting languages like AutoHotKey and AutoIT to execute code. While it is related to executing code, it does not specifically mention using system services.

- **D: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves using system services to execute code. This directly aligns with the question's requirement of executing code using system services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes gaining initial access through a compromised software update, which aligns with the related TTPs of Supply Chain Compromise.
- The next step is to execute code using system services, which is directly addressed by the T1569-System Services technique.

### Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services
