Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where CosmicDuke establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred beforehand to gain initial access through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a PDF file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which of the given answer choices aligns best with the initial access technique that would lead to the exploitation of a PDF file vulnerability.

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not directly relate to gaining initial access through a PDF file.
- **B: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable** - This technique involves modifying the PATH environment variable to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to exploiting a PDF file.
- **C: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves tricking a user into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious files, often through emails or malicious websites. Exploiting a PDF file to gain initial access could be a form of phishing.
- **D: T1566-Phishing** - This is the same as C, so it is redundant.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the initial access technique that involves exploiting a PDF file. Phishing is a common method to trick users into opening malicious PDF files, which can then exploit vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
- The related TTPs mention techniques related to persistence and execution, which align with the subsequent steps after initial access but do not directly address the initial access method.
- Therefore, the most plausible initial access technique that involves exploiting a PDF file is phishing.

### Final Answer: C
