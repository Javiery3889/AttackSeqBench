Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT42:
1. Reconnaissance: Browsing compromised user contacts and accessing organizational collaborative spaces.
2. An unknown step.
3. Privilege Escalation: Using custom malware for keylogging and cookie data theft.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher-level access.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: This technique involves searching for information on websites owned by the victim.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically follows the reconnaissance phase and precedes the privilege escalation phase.

- **A: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic. While it can be used for reconnaissance, it does not directly lead to privilege escalation.
- **B: T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate**: This technique involves installing a digital certificate to establish trust. It is more related to establishing a foothold or maintaining persistence rather than directly leading to privilege escalation.
- **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying or creating accounts. It can be a step towards privilege escalation but is not as direct as using custom malware.
- **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes. This is a direct method for keylogging and can be used to steal cookie data, which aligns with the described privilege escalation step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The reconnaissance phase involves browsing compromised user contacts and accessing organizational collaborative spaces.
- The next step should be a method that directly leads to the use of custom malware for keylogging and cookie data theft, which is a form of privilege escalation.
- Among the given options, T1056-Input Capture (D) is the most direct method for keylogging and stealing cookie data, which aligns with the described privilege escalation step.

### Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
