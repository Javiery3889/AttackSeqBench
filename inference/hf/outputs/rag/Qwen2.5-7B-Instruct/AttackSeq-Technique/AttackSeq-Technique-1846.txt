### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the TAIDOOR RAT decrypts and executes the main malware in memory. The next step is to establish communication with its C2 servers.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to establish this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols to establish C2 communication.
     - **Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves maintaining a bidirectional communication channel with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - This technique is not directly related to establishing C2 communication. It is more about exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which can be a method to evade detection but is not specifically about establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053.003-Cron**
     - This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks, which is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code in a user context, which is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique directly involves maintaining a bidirectional communication channel with the C2 server, which aligns with the question's requirement to establish communication with C2 servers.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication
