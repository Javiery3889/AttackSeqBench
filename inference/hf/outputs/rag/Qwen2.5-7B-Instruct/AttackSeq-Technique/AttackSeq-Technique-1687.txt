### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where credentials from compromised systems are used to access servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.
   - The final step in the sequence is the establishment of communications with a C&C server using the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to maintain or enhance access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves using chat messages to exfiltrate or transfer credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness:** This technique is about exploiting weak permissions in the Windows registry to gain elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to establishing communications with a C&C server.
   - **Option B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data or maintain access. While it could be relevant, it does not directly describe the method of communication with a C&C server.
   - **Option C: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection. This could be a plausible method for establishing communications with a C&C server.
   - **Option D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate, such as biometric data or hardware tokens. It does not directly describe the method of communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of establishing communications with a C&C server using the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan, is **T1571-Non-Standard Port**.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
