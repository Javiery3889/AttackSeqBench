Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Exported saved passwords from Chrome browsers were used for Credential Access.
2. StellarParticle demonstrated persistence using credential hopping.
3. New O365 Service Principals were created.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves using cloud accounts for persistence.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique involves accessing credentials from web browsers.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique is similar to the persistence technique but is related to initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1136-Create Account**
  - This technique involves creating new user accounts. While it could be part of persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the credential access or the creation of O365 Service Principals.

- **Answer Choice B: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
  - This technique involves using domain accounts. While it could be part of persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the credential access or the creation of O365 Service Principals.

- **Answer Choice C: T1560.002-Archive via Library**
  - This technique involves archiving data via a library. It doesn't directly relate to the credential access or the creation of O365 Service Principals.

- **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid accounts. This could be part of the credential access phase, where valid accounts are used to access credentials from web browsers (T1555.003). It also aligns with the persistence phase, where valid accounts might be used to maintain access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Access**: The question mentions using exported saved passwords from Chrome browsers, which aligns with T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers.
2. **Persistence**: The question mentions persistence using credential hopping, which aligns with T1078-Valid Accounts, as valid accounts are used to maintain access.
3. **O365 Service Principals**: The question mentions creating new O365 Service Principals, which aligns with T1078.004-Cloud Accounts.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Credential Access (T1555.003)**
- **Persistence (T1078)**
- **O365 Service Principals (T1078.004)**

The answer choice that best fits the persistence phase, which is crucial for the sequence described, is **T1078-Valid Accounts**.

### Final Answer: D
