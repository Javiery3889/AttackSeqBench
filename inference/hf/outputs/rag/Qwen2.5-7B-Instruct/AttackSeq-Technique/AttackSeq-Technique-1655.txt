Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. An unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability is exploited for initial access.
2. A group then customizes Android backdoors to collect SMS messages and call information for command and control purposes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: Techniques T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) and T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) are relevant.
- **Collection**: Technique T1560.003 (Archive via Custom Method) is relevant.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1552.007-Container API**: This technique is not directly related to the initial access or the collection of SMS and call information. It is more about using container APIs, which is not a common technique for the described scenario.
- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which could be a precursor to the collection of SMS and call information. However, it is not directly related to the initial access or the customization of Android backdoors.
- **C: T1547.012-Print Processors**: This technique is about using print processors to exfiltrate data, which is not directly related to the initial access or the collection of SMS and call information.
- **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could be a method to gather SMS and call information. However, it is not directly related to the initial access or the customization of Android backdoors.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is clearly described as exploiting an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, which aligns with T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application).
- The customization of Android backdoors to collect SMS and call information for command and control purposes is a form of data collection, which aligns with T1560.003 (Archive via Custom Method).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Initial Access (T1190)
2. Collection (T1560.003)

Among the given answer choices, none directly match the sequence, but the closest in context is:
- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** could be a precursor to the collection of SMS and call information, but it is not the most direct match.

However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence and none of the choices perfectly fit, the best answer based on the provided choices and the context is:

**Final Answer: B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
