Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Websites are compromised through watering hole tactics.
2. Exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 are injected.
3. The next step involves executing custom shellcode, de-obfuscating strings, initializing a network connection, and downloading the payload 'dropper.dll'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access to a system. This aligns with the initial compromise of websites and the injection of exploits.
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web browser or other client application without user interaction. This also aligns with the watering hole attack and the injection of exploits.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the next step after exploiting the websites would be to execute the payload and perform the subsequent actions (executing custom shellcode, de-obfuscating strings, initializing a network connection, and downloading the payload 'dropper.dll').

- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the client system. This aligns well with the actions described in the question, as it involves executing custom shellcode and downloading additional payloads.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
