### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 first dumps the LSASS process memory and then uses network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after these actions but before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Credential Access," which aligns with the actions of dumping LSASS memory and network sniffing.
   - The technique "T1003.001-LSASS Memory" is directly related to the dumping of LSASS process memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
     - This technique is about using or bypassing multi-factor authentication, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **B: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is more about compromising the authentication process rather than directly obtaining credentials.
   - **C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**
     - This technique involves using unsecured credentials, which could be a result of the actions described (e.g., credentials obtained from network sniffing), but it does not directly follow the actions of dumping LSASS memory and network sniffing.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which logically follows the actions of obtaining credentials through network sniffing and LSASS memory dump. It provides context for the internal reconnaissance that would follow.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is that after FIN13 dumps the LSASS process memory and employs network sniffing to obtain credentials, the next step would be to gather victim identity information to facilitate further internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
