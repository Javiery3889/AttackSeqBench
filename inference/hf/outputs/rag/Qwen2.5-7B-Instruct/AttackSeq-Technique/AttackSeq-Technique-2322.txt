### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in abilities (SMB and PsExec) for Lateral Movement to deploy beacons on additional systems.
   - The sequence continues with the adversary collecting data from information repositories and user mailboxes for exfiltration.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows the deployment of beacons but precedes the data collection and exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB or Windows Admin Shares for Lateral Movement.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to other systems for Lateral Movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1021.007-Cloud Services** - This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs, as it involves using cloud services for Lateral Movement, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Option B: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions** - This technique involves gaining additional permissions through email, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Option C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** - This technique involves exploiting remote services, which could be a step in the sequence but is not as directly relevant as the next step in the described sequence.
   - **Option D: T1005-Data from Local System** - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which logically follows the deployment of beacons and precedes the exfiltration of data from information repositories and user mailboxes.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **D: T1005-Data from Local System**.

Final Answer: D
