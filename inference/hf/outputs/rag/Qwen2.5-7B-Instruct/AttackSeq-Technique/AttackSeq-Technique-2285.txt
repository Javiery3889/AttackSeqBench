### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Regin (a malware) has already gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic during its discovery phase.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique aligns with the initial gathering of information on processes, memory utilization, and network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique is about evading detection, which is a step that could follow the initial discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique is about discovering processes, which is part of the initial discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server:** This technique is not directly related to the initial discovery phase or the subsequent steps that would follow.
   - **B: T1110.001-Password Guessing:** This technique involves attempting to guess passwords, which is not directly related to the initial discovery phase or the subsequent steps that would follow.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which could be a step after the initial discovery phase to gain further access.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over an alternative protocol, which is a step that would likely occur after gaining access and possibly after stealing credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first gather information (T1082-System Information Discovery), then potentially steal credentials (T1555-Credentials from Password Stores), and finally exfiltrate the data (T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol).
   - Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred after the initial discovery phase is T1555-Credentials from Password Stores, as it is a logical step in the sequence of actions that would follow the initial discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
