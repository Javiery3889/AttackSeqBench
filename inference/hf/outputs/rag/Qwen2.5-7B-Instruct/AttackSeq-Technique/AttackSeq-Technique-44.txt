Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host.
2. An action occurred after this execution.
3. The stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- **Collection**: T1113-Screen Capture
- **Command and Control**: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP logically follows the execution of arbitrary code and precedes the exfiltration of stolen screenshots.

- **A: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of arbitrary code or the collection of screenshots.
- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which aligns with the stolen screenshots mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This technique involves monitoring user activity, which doesn't directly relate to the execution of arbitrary code or the collection of screenshots.
- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring malware runs at boot or logon, which precedes the execution of arbitrary code, not follows it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of arbitrary code by KONNI malware is a prerequisite for any subsequent action.
- The stolen screenshots need to be captured before they can be exfiltrated.
- T1113-Screen Capture (B) is the most logical TTP that fits between the execution of arbitrary code and the exfiltration of stolen screenshots.

### Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture
