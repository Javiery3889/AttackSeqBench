### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an implant named 'NewPass' is executed using a dropper with an exported function 'LocalDataVer'.
   - The implant then communicates with a command-and-control (C2) server using a stealthy POST request mechanism.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and the Techniques: T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1008-Fallback Channels.
   - T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to using web protocols for command and control.
   - T1008-Fallback Channels refers to using alternative communication channels in case the primary C2 channel is detected or blocked.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the communication mechanism (POST request) or the stealthiness of the communication.
   - **Option B: T1543.003-Windows Service**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services, which is also not directly related to the communication mechanism or stealthiness.
   - **Option C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows search order to intercept and execute malicious code. While it can be used to execute code, it does not directly relate to the communication mechanism or stealthiness.
   - **Option D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel. However, the question is about the technique that occurred before the implant began communicating, not the exfiltration itself.
   - **Option D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique directly relates to using web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the stealthy POST request mechanism mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: T1071.001-Web Protocols
