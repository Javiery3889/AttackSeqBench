Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. TG-3279 gathers information on targets through open source research or network scanning.
2. The next step is gaining initial access using tools like 's' or 'rdp_crk'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the initial gathering of information.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections, which is also part of the reconnaissance phase.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses**: This technique involves gathering email addresses, which is another form of reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices logically follows the initial gathering of information and the use of tools like 's' or 'rdp_crk' for gaining initial access.

- **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports, which could be a method to avoid detection but does not directly follow the gathering of information and gaining initial access.
- **B: T1543.002-Systemd Service**: This technique involves using systemd services, which is more about maintaining persistence and not directly related to the initial access phase.
- **C: T1583.008-Malvertising**: This technique involves using malicious advertisements, which is a method to deliver malware but does not directly follow the initial access phase.
- **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure to maintain access and control, which logically follows gaining initial access and is a step that would be taken after initial access has been achieved.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gathering Information**: TG-3279 uses open source research or network scanning (T1018 and T1049).
2. **Gaining Initial Access**: TG-3279 uses tools like 's' or 'rdp_crk' to gain initial access.
3. **Compromise Infrastructure**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to compromise infrastructure to maintain access and control.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
