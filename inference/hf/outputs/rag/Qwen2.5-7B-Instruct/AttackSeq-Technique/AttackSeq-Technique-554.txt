Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where MuddyWater attackers used Meterpreter and Mimikatz to evade defenses and then facilitated communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique best fits this scenario.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1083)**: This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to maintain access to the target network.
- **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves the use of proxy servers to route traffic and evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1027)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender.
- **Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves hiding the true nature of an actor, tool, or activity.
- **Tactic: Resource Development (T1588)**: This tactic involves the development and maintenance of tools and resources used in the attack.
- **Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves the use of tools to support the attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves the use of traffic patterns to communicate with the attacker. While it can be used for command and control, it does not specifically mention the use of domains and proxy URLs.
- **B: T1564.005-Hidden File System**: This technique involves hiding files to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the use of domains and proxy URLs for communication.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control. While it can be used for communication, it does not specifically mention the use of domains and proxy URLs.
- **D: T1548.004-Elevated Execution with Prompt**: This technique involves gaining elevated privileges to execute commands. It does not directly relate to the use of domains and proxy URLs for communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the use of domains and proxy URLs for communication, which aligns with the T1090-Proxy technique.
- T1090-Proxy is specifically about using proxy servers to route traffic and evade detection, which fits the scenario of using domains and proxy URLs to facilitate communication with compromised systems.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol (This is incorrect based on the analysis, the correct answer should be T1090-Proxy)

Given the analysis, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: T1090-Proxy
