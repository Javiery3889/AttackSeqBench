Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the initial technique used to establish communication with the C2 domain "judystevenson[.]info" before additional C2 domains were identified through pivoting on Googlebot-like user agent strings.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains** - This suggests the attacker was developing or using domains.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer** - This is about transferring data at a scheduled time, which is not directly relevant to the initial C2 domain establishment.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS** - This is about using DNS for C2 communication, which is relevant to the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1001.001-Junk Data** - This technique is about using junk data to obfuscate the payload or communication. It doesn't directly relate to establishing C2 communication.
- **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks** - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to find vulnerable targets. It is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. While it is related to C2, it is more general and doesn't specifically address the initial domain establishment.
- **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware. It is a common method to establish initial access, which can then be used to establish C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is specifically about establishing communication with the initial C2 domain "judystevenson[.]info" before pivoting on Googlebot-like user agent strings.
- The most plausible initial technique to establish this C2 communication would be a method that directly involves tricking the user into providing access or downloading malware, which can then be used to establish the C2.
- Among the given options, **T1566-Phishing** (D) is the most relevant and plausible technique for establishing initial access and C2 communication.

### Final Answer: D
