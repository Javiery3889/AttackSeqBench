Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access was gained through exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
2. The next step is to establish persistence.
3. The persistence method mentioned is using a Run key and the `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique is relevant to the initial access via exploiting a vulnerability.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique is directly related to establishing persistence using a Run key.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is also related to persistence but is more general and could include other methods of autostart execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the question and related TTPs:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is related to the initial access but does not fit the sequence as it is not the next step after initial access.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique is not directly related to the persistence methods mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique is related to using Visual Basic for scripting, which could be part of the persistence mechanism. However, it is not the most direct or specific technique for the given context.
- **D: T1218.014-MMC**: This technique is related to using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for persistence, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is clearly through exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882).
- The next step is to establish persistence.
- The persistence method mentioned is using a Run key and the `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` file, which aligns with the T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder technique.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly addresses the persistence method mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: C**
