Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Decrypting the data.res file.
2. Preparing the payload to inject into a chosen process.
3. Setting file attributes to "hidden" and "system" using kernel32.dll timestamps for evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1070.006-Timestomp**: This technique involves modifying the timestamps of files to evade detection.
- **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**: This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the actions described in the question.
- **B: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**: This technique involves using the Terminal Services Remote Procedure Call (TS-RPC) protocol to load a DLL into a remote process. It does not directly relate to the actions described in the question.
- **C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique involves using resource forks to hide data. It does not directly relate to the actions described in the question.
- **D: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to execute it. The question mentions preparing a payload to inject into a chosen process, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Setting file attributes to "hidden" and "system" using kernel32.dll timestamps for evasion (T1070.006-Timestomp and T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories).
- Injecting the payload into a chosen process (T1055-Process Injection).

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection**
