Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence on the system.
2. It downloaded a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
3. It communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is relevant to the communication with control servers.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This is specifically about using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Persistence**: This is relevant to the implant ensuring persistence.
- **Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This is about ensuring persistence by placing a binary in the startup folder.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred after the implant ensured persistence and before the HTTP POST communication.

- **Option A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This TTP is about discovering network connections, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
  
- **Option B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This TTP involves using a command and scripting interpreter, which could be part of the implant's behavior but is not directly related to the sequence described.
  
- **Option C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This TTP is about discovering network configurations, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
  
- **Option D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
  - This TTP involves network poisoning and relaying, which is not directly related to the sequence described.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that occurred after ensuring persistence and before the HTTP POST communication is the one that involves the actual execution or interaction with the second-stage binary. The TTP that best fits this description is:

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

This TTP aligns with the execution of the second-stage binary, which is a logical step after ensuring persistence and before communicating with the control servers.
