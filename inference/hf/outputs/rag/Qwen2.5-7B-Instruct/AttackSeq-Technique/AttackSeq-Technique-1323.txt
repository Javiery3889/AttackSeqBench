Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial TTPs**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and configuring a Windows service named 'javamtsup'.
- **Subsequent TTP**: The malware searches hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns, including targeting non-English filenames.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence**: This is relevant as persistence is a key aspect of the initial TTPs.
- **Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This is directly mentioned in the question and is a part of the initial persistence mechanism.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard**
  - This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs. It involves using cloud service dashboards, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
  - This technique involves planting a list of files or directories to be monitored or acted upon. It could be relevant as the malware is searching for specific file patterns, but it does not directly align with the search for non-English filenames.
- **Answer Choice C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. It aligns well with the malware's action of searching hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns, including non-English filenames.
- **Answer Choice D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves using scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malware. While it is related to the initial persistence mechanism, it does not describe the subsequent action of searching for specific file patterns.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial TTPs involve achieving persistence through a scheduled task.
- The subsequent TTP involves searching for specific file patterns, including non-English filenames.
- Among the given choices, T1083-File and Directory Discovery (C) best aligns with the described action of searching for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.

### Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
