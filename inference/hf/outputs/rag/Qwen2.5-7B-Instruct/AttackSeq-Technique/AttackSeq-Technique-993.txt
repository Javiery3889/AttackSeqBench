Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access through a phishing email.
2. Using a VBS script to drop a JavaScript backdoor.
3. Executing an obfuscated script.
4. Loading a DLL file in memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the techniques involved:
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is relevant to the obfuscation of the script.
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is relevant to loading a DLL file in memory.
- **T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique is relevant to the use of JavaScript.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is not directly related to the obfuscation of scripts or loading DLLs in memory.
- **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This technique is related to hiding emails, which is not directly relevant to the obfuscation of scripts or loading DLLs.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique is related to the use of shared libraries, which could be relevant to loading a DLL in memory. However, it does not specifically address the obfuscation of the script.
- **D: T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM)**: This technique is related to the use of COM objects, which can be used to load DLLs in memory. It also aligns with the obfuscation of scripts, as COM objects can be used to execute obfuscated code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question involves obfuscating a script and loading a DLL in memory.
- T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM) is the most relevant technique because it can be used to both load a DLL in memory and execute obfuscated code.
- T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is also relevant but does not directly address the loading of a DLL.
- T1129-Shared Modules is relevant to loading a DLL but does not address the obfuscation of the script.

### Final Answer: D: T1559.001-Component Object Model
