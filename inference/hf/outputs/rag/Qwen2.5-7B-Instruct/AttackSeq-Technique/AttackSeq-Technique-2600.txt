Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where credit card data is intercepted at store checkout pages. The data is then sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server. We need to identify which TTP occurred before the stolen data was sent to the collection server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves monitoring network traffic to discover sensitive information.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique is similar to the above but focuses on accessing credentials.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the interception or collection of data.
- **B: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into web pages. While it can be used to intercept data, it is not directly related to the collection of data after interception.
- **C: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**: This technique involves using a network logon script to gain access to network resources. It is not directly related to the interception or collection of data.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is not directly related to the interception or collection of data.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurred before the stolen data was sent to the collection server is **T1040-Network Sniffing**. This technique involves monitoring network traffic to discover sensitive information, which aligns with the scenario of intercepting credit card data at store checkout pages.

**Final Answer: B (T1659-Content Injection)**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most accurate and relevant TTP from the provided list is **T1040-Network Sniffing**. Therefore, the correct answer should be:

**Final Answer: T1040-Network Sniffing**
