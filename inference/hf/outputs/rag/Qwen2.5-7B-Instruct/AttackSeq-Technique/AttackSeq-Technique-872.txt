Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy operators have already used tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials. The next step in the sequence is to redirect requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using external proxies for command and control.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves developing or using tools, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz and PsExec.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using proxies for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**: This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote management. While it can be used for command and control, it does not directly relate to the redirection through internal C&C proxies.
- **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services, which could be part of the initial compromise but does not directly relate to the redirection through internal C&C proxies.
- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting public-facing applications, which could be part of the initial compromise but does not directly relate to the redirection through internal C&C proxies.
- **D: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files, which is not relevant to the redirection through internal C&C proxies.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the operators have already gained credentials and are now redirecting requests through internal C&C proxies.
- The related TTPs mention T1090.002-External Proxy and T1090-Proxy, which directly relate to the redirection through internal C&C proxies.
- None of the other techniques (A, B, C) directly align with the redirection through internal C&C proxies.

### Final Answer: T1090-Proxy (Technique: T1090-Proxy) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question. However, since the question provides specific answer choices, the closest match is:

Final Answer: T1090-Proxy (Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy)
