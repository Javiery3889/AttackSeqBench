### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Earth Wendigo used a Service Worker script to intercept HTTPS POST requests and steal webmail login credentials.
   - The key elements are:
     - Intercepting HTTPS POST requests
     - Stealing webmail login credentials
     - Using a Service Worker script

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves sniffing network traffic to capture credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique is similar to the above, focusing on discovering credentials through network sniffing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1557.004-Evil Twin**
     - This technique involves setting up a fake network to capture credentials. While it can be used for credential access, it is not directly related to intercepting HTTPS POST requests.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an alternative protocol. It is not directly related to the initial interception of credentials.
   - **C: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
     - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management for command and control. It is not directly related to intercepting HTTPS POST requests.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which can be used to intercept credentials. It aligns well with the need to capture webmail login credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the need to intercept HTTPS POST requests and steal webmail login credentials, is best aligned with the technique of capturing user input.
   - **Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
