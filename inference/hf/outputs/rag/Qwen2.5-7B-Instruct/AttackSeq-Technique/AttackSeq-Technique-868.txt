### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by GreyEnergy's operators, starting with spearphishing and server compromise.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they attempted lateral movement to other workstations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a service or feature of a remote system to gain access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using spearphishing within the target network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be a part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the lateral movement described in the question.
   - **Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it could be a step in the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the initial compromise or lateral movement.
   - **Option C: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering information about the browser to tailor attacks. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the lateral movement.
   - **Option D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to gain access to the target network. This could be a plausible technique that could occur before lateral movement, as it would provide a foothold within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that a supply chain compromise (T1195) could be the technique that occurred before the lateral movement to other workstations.

**Final Answer: D**
