Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where:
1. Sayad malware is executed.
2. It drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
3. The malware needs to ensure it runs at startup using `rundll32.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
- **Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using `rundll32.exe` to execute code.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
- **Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**
  - This technique is not directly related to ensuring the malware runs at startup using `rundll32.exe`. It is more about asynchronous communication, which is not relevant to the startup execution context.

- **Answer Choice B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking COM objects, which is not directly related to the use of `rundll32.exe` for startup execution.

- **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves automated data collection, which is not directly related to the startup execution context.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique directly involves ensuring that malware runs at startup. It is the most relevant to the question as it aligns with the need to ensure the malware runs at startup using `rundll32.exe`.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware needing to run at startup using `rundll32.exe`.
- The related TTPs mention `rundll32.exe` and `T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution`.
- `T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution` is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the need to ensure the malware runs at startup.

### Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
