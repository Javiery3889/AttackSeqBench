### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through a watering hole attack and exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next in the sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "T1189-Drive-by Compromise."
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a technique where attackers use a malicious website to deliver malware to a user's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** - This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial access method. It is unlikely that the same technique would be used again immediately after gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data** - This technique involves storing or archiving data collected from the target. It is a step that could occur after gaining access but is not directly related to the initial compromise.
   - **C: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves the use of cloud services to maintain access or exfiltrate data. It is a plausible step after gaining initial access, but it is not directly related to the initial compromise.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts** - This technique involves the use of default credentials to gain access. It is not directly related to the initial compromise through a watering hole attack and exploiting CVE-2018-8174.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve actions that occur after the initial compromise. T1560-Archive Collected Data is a logical step that follows the initial access and could be used to store or exfiltrate data collected from the target.

**Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
