Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT42 initially gains access through spear phishing and bypasses MFA. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to complement their credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1566-Phishing, T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- **Reconnaissance**: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**
  - This technique involves installing a root certificate to bypass security controls. While it can be used for credential harvesting, it doesn't directly complement lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

- **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing custom tools and capabilities. It aligns well with the need for lightweight tools and custom backdoors, which are mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**
  - This technique involves using social media accounts for reconnaissance or other malicious activities. While it can be part of the initial access, it doesn't directly complement lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

- **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - This technique involves using spearphishing to gain access within an organization. While it is part of the initial access, it doesn't directly complement lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question emphasizes the need for lightweight tools and custom backdoors after gaining initial access via spear phishing.
- T1587-Develop Capabilities (B) directly addresses the development of custom tools and capabilities, which aligns with the need for lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

### Final Answer: B: T1587-Develop Capabilities
