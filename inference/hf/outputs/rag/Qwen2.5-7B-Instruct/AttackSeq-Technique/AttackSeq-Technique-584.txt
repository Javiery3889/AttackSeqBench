Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gaining credential access through Mimikatz and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.
2. Using webshells to execute commands on other systems within the network.
3. Dumping credentials to further execute commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to extract credentials.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.002-Security Account Manager (SAM)**: This technique involves accessing the SAM database to extract credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique is not relevant to the described sequence of actions. It involves collecting email addresses locally, which is not related to credential access or lateral movement.

- **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not directly related to the described sequence of actions involving webshells and credential dumping.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to gain access to a system. It can be used for lateral movement, but it is not directly related to the described sequence of actions involving webshells and credential dumping.

- **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services to gain access to a system. It is not directly related to the described sequence of actions involving webshells and credential dumping.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves gaining credential access, using webshells, and dumping credentials to execute commands on other systems.
- The related TTPs indicate that the actors used techniques for credential access (T1003.001 and T1003.002) and lateral movement (T1550.002).
- The technique that best fits the described sequence of actions is **T1021-Remote Services**, as it involves using remote services to gain access to a system, which aligns with the use of webshells and dumping credentials to execute commands on other systems.

### Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
