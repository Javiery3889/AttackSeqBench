### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious Excel document 'Circular.xls' is delivered, and then a Downloader 1 is used to execute another executable.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique enabled the execution step after the delivery of the malicious Excel document.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves executing a malicious file that is delivered to the target.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.004-Compile After Delivery** - This technique involves compiling or executing a file after it has been delivered to the target, often to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using a web service to deliver or execute malware. It does not directly relate to the execution of a malicious file delivered via an Excel document.
   - **Option B: T1012-Query Registry** - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information. It is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file.
   - **Option C: T1648-Serverless Execution** - This technique involves executing code in a serverless computing environment. It is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file delivered via an Excel document.
   - **Option D: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client system. It is more aligned with the execution of a malicious file delivered via an Excel document, as it involves the exploitation of a vulnerability to run the malicious payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is that the execution step after the delivery of the malicious Excel document 'Circular.xls' was enabled by the exploitation of a vulnerability to execute the malicious payload.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **D: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

**Final Answer: D**
