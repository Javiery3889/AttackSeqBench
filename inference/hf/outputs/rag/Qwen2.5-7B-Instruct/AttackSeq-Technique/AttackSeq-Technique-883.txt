Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attackers used spear phishing with customized documents containing exploits for known vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. After gaining initial access, they deployed modules capable of scanning the local network and accessing hosts using admin credentials for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique aligns with the spear phishing attack using customized documents containing exploits.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique aligns with the scanning and accessing hosts using admin credentials for lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access**: This technique is not directly related to the initial access or lateral movement described in the question. It involves temporary access to cloud resources, which is not the focus here.
- **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to the initial access or lateral movement described.
- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which aligns with the use of admin credentials for lateral movement. However, it does not directly describe the scanning and exploitation of remote services.
- **D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique involves managing application domains, which is not directly related to the initial access or lateral movement described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is described as spear phishing with customized documents containing exploits, which aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
- The subsequent action is scanning the local network and accessing hosts using admin credentials for lateral movement, which aligns with T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurs after the initial access and before the lateral movement is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

### Final Answer: D
