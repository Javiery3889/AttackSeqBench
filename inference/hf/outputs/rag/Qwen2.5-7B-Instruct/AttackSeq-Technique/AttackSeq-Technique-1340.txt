### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already used anti-analysis techniques (custom packer and virtual machine) to execute code.
   - The next step in the sequence is downloading second-stage shellcode from a specified URL for further control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments, which aligns with the use of a virtual machine for execution.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This is the same as the previous one, emphasizing the evasion of virtualization and sandbox environments.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to establish or maintain access, which aligns with downloading second-stage shellcode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves using protocols to tunnel data through a network, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts on the system to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **Option C: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into a system, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **Option D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system, which aligns with the next step in the sequence of downloading second-stage shellcode.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
