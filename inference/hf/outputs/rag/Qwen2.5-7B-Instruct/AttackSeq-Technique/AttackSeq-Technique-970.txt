### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Aria-body backdoor has already collected detailed host and network information.
   - The next step in the sequence is gathering data on installed software as part of the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the "Discovery" tactic.
   - Specifically, they include:
     - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
     - T1082-System Information Discovery
     - T1518-Software Discovery

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system. While it is part of the discovery phase, it does not directly lead to the discovery of installed software.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system itself, such as the operating system version, hardware details, and other system information. This is also part of the discovery phase but does not directly lead to the discovery of installed software.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying software installed on the target system. This is the most direct step towards discovering installed software, which is the next step in the sequence described in the question.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots of the target system's screen. While it can be part of the discovery phase, it is not directly related to gathering information about installed software.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the Aria-body backdoor collected detailed host and network information, the next step would be to gather information about the software installed on the system. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery
