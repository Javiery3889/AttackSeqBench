### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where KerrDown is delivered via malicious Office documents or DLL side-loading methods.
   - After delivery, base64 blobs are decoded and executed based on the victim's system architecture.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the decoding and execution of the base64 blobs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the following techniques:
     - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is relevant to the delivery method (DLL side-loading).
     - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is relevant to the decoding and execution of the base64 blobs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique is not directly related to the delivery method or the decoding process described in the question.
   - **B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique is related to scheduling tasks, which is not directly relevant to the delivery and decoding process.
   - **C: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to the delivery and decoding process.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves convincing a user to execute a file or script. Given that the base64 blobs are decoded and executed based on the victim's system architecture, this technique is closely related to the initial action that leads to the execution of the decoded payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that the user was convinced to execute the malicious payload, leading to the decoding and execution of the base64 blobs.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **D: T1204-User Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution**
