### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware (Grabit) has already established persistence by modifying common registry entries with startup configurations.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this persistence was established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is Persistence, and the specific technique is T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.
   - This confirms that the malware has already established persistence through registry modifications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to persistence or registry modifications.
   - **B: T1003.003-NTDS**
     - This technique involves accessing the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit), which is more related to lateral movement and data exfiltration rather than persistence.
   - **C: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**
     - This technique involves changing file associations, which can be used to maintain persistence by ensuring that certain files are opened with the malware's payload. This aligns well with the context of persistence and registry modifications.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is a method of initial compromise, not a persistence technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the malware has established persistence through registry modifications is to change default file associations to ensure the malware's payload is executed whenever certain files are opened.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: C"
