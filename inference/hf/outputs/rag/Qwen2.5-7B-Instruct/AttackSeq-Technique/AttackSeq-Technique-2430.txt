Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already used coordinated command and control to facilitate ATM withdrawals with physical mules. The final step involves manipulating the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves attackers moving laterally within a network by exploiting remote services. This is relevant as it suggests the attackers are moving within the bank's internal systems.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique involves the theft of funds or financial data. Given the context of the question, this is a relevant technique as it directly aligns with the goal of enabling unauthorized financial gains.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves deploying software to a target system. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly align with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.
- **Answer Choice B: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**: This technique involves inhibiting the recovery of a system, which could be a step in preventing detection. However, it does not directly align with the goal of enabling unauthorized financial gains.
- **Answer Choice C: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique directly aligns with the goal of enabling unauthorized financial gains. Given the context of the question, this is the most relevant technique.
- **Answer Choice D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**: This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets, which could be used to gain unauthorized access. However, it does not directly align with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have already facilitated ATM withdrawals and are now focusing on the final step to enable unauthorized financial gains.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are moving laterally within the network and are focused on financial theft.
- Among the answer choices, T1657-Financial Theft (Answer Choice C) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the goal of enabling unauthorized financial gains.

### Final Answer: C
