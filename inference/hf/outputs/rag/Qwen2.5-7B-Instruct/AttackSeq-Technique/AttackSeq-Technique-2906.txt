Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Tickusb's malicious activities were triggered by opening specific programs instead of running at system startup. This implies that the malicious activities were not set to run at system startup but were triggered by user actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which could be triggered by opening a specific program.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the DLL search order to execute malicious code.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up malware to run at system startup.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This is not a valid ATT&CK technique. It seems to be a typo or misinterpretation.
- **Option B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**: This technique involves removing or disabling persistence mechanisms, which is not relevant to the question.
- **Option C: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code in the context of a user, which aligns with the scenario where the malicious activities are triggered by opening specific programs.
- **Option D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow, which could be relevant but is more about hijacking the execution flow rather than the initial trigger.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the malicious activities were triggered by opening specific programs, not running at system startup.
- T1204-User Execution (C) directly aligns with the scenario where the malicious activities are triggered by user actions, such as opening specific programs.
- The other options do not fit the context as well as T1204-User Execution.

### Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution
