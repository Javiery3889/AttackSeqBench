### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Pierogi backdoor is downloaded and executed via an embedded macro in a Microsoft Word document.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure the backdoor runs upon user login.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Persistence" and the technique is "T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution."
   - This technique is specifically designed to ensure that malware or malicious software runs automatically when a user logs into their system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
     - This technique involves using the Windows Terminal Services (RDP) to load a DLL. It is not directly related to ensuring something runs at login.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique directly aligns with the requirement to ensure the backdoor runs upon user login. It involves adding a file to the system's startup folder or registry keys to run automatically at logon.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
     - This technique is about exfiltrating data over a network, which is not relevant to the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1098.005-Device Registration**
     - This technique involves registering a device with a management system, which is not related to ensuring something runs at login.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
