### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the OceanLotus Group harvested credentials and then used Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks for further network infection.
   - The focus is on the technique that facilitated the expansion within the network during Operation Cobalt Kitty.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique is used to harvest credentials by poisoning network protocols (LLMNR/NBT-NS) and relaying SMB requests.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to perform pass-the-hash attacks to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:**
     - This technique is also about using stolen credentials to evade detection and move laterally.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1546.008-Accessibility Features**
     - This technique is not directly related to credential harvesting or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique is about removing indicators of compromise, which is more about evading detection rather than the initial credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions, which is not directly related to the credential harvesting and pass-the-hash attacks mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The related TTPs specifically mention LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay (T1557.001) for credential harvesting and Pass the Hash (T1550.002) for lateral movement.
   - The question asks for the technique that facilitated the expansion within the network, and the most relevant technique from the provided list is T1557.001, which is directly related to the initial credential harvesting.

### Final Answer: C (T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay)
