Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM:
1. Conducting reconnaissance.
2. Targeting Indian government and military personnel.
3. Using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the initial access and reconnaissance techniques:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is directly related to the use of spear-phishing emails.
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique is related to the use of watering hole sites.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided TTPs:

- **A: T1543.005-Container Service**: This TTP is not directly related to the initial access or reconnaissance techniques mentioned in the question. It is more about using container services, which is not a primary focus of the described attack sequence.

- **B: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This TTP is related to network devices, which is not directly relevant to the initial access or reconnaissance techniques described.

- **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This TTP is about developing capabilities, which could be a logical next step after initial access and reconnaissance. It aligns well with the sequence of actions described in the question.

- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This TTP is about gathering victim identity information, which is a step that could occur after initial access and reconnaissance but is not the primary focus of the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include reconnaissance and initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole sites.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of spear-phishing (T1566.002) and drive-by compromise (T1189) as part of the initial access.
- The next logical step after gaining access and conducting reconnaissance would be to develop the capabilities to maintain and expand the foothold.

### Final Answer: C: T1587-Develop Capabilities
