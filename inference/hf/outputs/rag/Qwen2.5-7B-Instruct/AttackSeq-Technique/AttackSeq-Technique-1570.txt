### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Turla used its RPC backdoor plugins to monitor USB drives and gather file and directory information within the local environment.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial collection and discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
     - This technique involves the collection of data from removable media, which aligns with the monitoring of USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is consistent with the gathering of file and directory information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is not directly related to the specific context of monitoring USB drives and gathering file and directory information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1557.004-Evil Twin**
     - This technique involves setting up a fake network to intercept and manipulate communications, which is not directly related to the described scenario.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1593.002-Search Engines**
     - This technique involves using search engines to gather information, which is not directly related to the described scenario.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the initial phase involved monitoring USB drives and gathering file and directory information, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data to the attacker's server.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
