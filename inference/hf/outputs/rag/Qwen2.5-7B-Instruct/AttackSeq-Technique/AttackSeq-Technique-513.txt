Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Milum Trojan transmitted compressed and encrypted JSON data via HTTP POST requests for C2 communication. This implies that the technique in question should be a preparatory step for the C2 communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. It is directly related to the C2 communication via HTTP POST requests.
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to bypass security measures. It is related to data manipulation but not directly to the C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves ensuring the malware runs automatically when the system boots or when a user logs on. While this is a common initial step for malware, it does not directly relate to the C2 communication via HTTP POST requests.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
  - This technique is directly related to the C2 communication via HTTP POST requests. However, the question asks for a technique that occurred before the C2 communication, not during or after it.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves compromising a system or network to establish a foothold. While this is a preparatory step, it is too broad and not specifically related to the C2 communication via HTTP POST requests.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to bypass security measures. While this is related to data manipulation, it is not directly related to the C2 communication via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Milum Trojan needs to establish a C2 channel via HTTP POST requests. The related TTPs indicate that the technique should be related to the C2 communication.
- T1071.001-Web Protocols is directly related to the C2 communication via HTTP POST requests, but it does not fit the "before" requirement.
- T1132-Data Encoding is related to data manipulation but not specifically to the C2 communication.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a preparatory step that ensures the malware runs automatically, which is a common initial step but not directly related to the C2 communication.
- T1584-Compromise Infrastructure is a broader technique that could be a preparatory step, but it is too broad and not specifically related to the C2 communication.

Given the context and the need for a preparatory step that is directly related to the C2 communication, the most plausible answer is a technique that ensures the malware is ready to communicate, which is best represented by T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

### Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
