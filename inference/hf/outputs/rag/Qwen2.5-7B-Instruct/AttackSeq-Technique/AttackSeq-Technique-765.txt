Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Derusbi server variant ensures its persistence by installing itself as a service using the `DllRegisterServer` function. It also mentions that the execution of this service is dependent on `svchost`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence
- Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided related TTPs.

- **A: T1543.002-Systemd Service**
  - This TTP is related to Linux systems and not Windows, which makes it irrelevant to the question.

- **B: T1569-System Services**
  - This TTP is broader and could potentially cover the installation of a service, but it does not specifically mention the `DllRegisterServer` function or the dependency on `svchost`.

- **C: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
  - This TTP is related to delivering malware via a malicious link, which is not directly related to the installation of a service using `DllRegisterServer`.

- **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - This TTP is more general and could cover the creation or modification of a system process, but it does not specifically mention the installation of a service using `DllRegisterServer`.

- **T1543.003-Windows Service (related TTP)**
  - This TTP specifically mentions the creation of a Windows service, which aligns with the question's description of the Derusbi server variant installing itself as a service.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the Derusbi server variant installing itself as a service using `DllRegisterServer`.
- The related TTP, T1543.003-Windows Service, directly aligns with this description.
- None of the other answer choices provide a specific match to the `DllRegisterServer` function or the installation of a service dependent on `svchost`.

### Final Answer: B
