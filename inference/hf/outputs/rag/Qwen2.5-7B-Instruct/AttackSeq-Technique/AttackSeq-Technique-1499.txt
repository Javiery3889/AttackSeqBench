### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where RogueRobin executed a PowerShell script that was obfuscated using the COMPRESS technique from the Invoke-Obfuscation tool and used sandbox detection methods for Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" and "Command Obfuscation" (T1027.010). This indicates that the attack sequence involves techniques to evade detection and obfuscate commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1555.002-Securityd Memory**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows Security Center service to hide malicious activity. While it is related to Defense Evasion, it does not directly follow the obfuscation and sandbox detection steps described.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves compromising or subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or privileges. It is a broad technique and does not specifically follow the obfuscation and sandbox detection steps.
   - **C: T1564.011-Ignore Process Interrupts**
     - This technique involves ensuring that a process can continue to run even if it is interrupted. It is more about process persistence and not directly related to the obfuscation and sandbox detection steps.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable or to bypass detection mechanisms. Given that the PowerShell script was obfuscated using the COMPRESS technique, this technique aligns well with the obfuscation step described.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding
