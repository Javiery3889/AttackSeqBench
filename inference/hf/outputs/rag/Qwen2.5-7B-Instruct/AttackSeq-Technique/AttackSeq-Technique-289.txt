### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where "Before Dropping Elephant" gained Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before the initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a target system. It is relevant to the exploitation phase but not directly to gathering information.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spear-phishing email to gain initial access. This is relevant to the initial access phase but not directly to gathering information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to gathering information.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it is not specifically about gathering information about high-profile entities.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the target, such as names, roles, and other details. This is directly relevant to the question as it involves gathering information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
   - **D: T1074-Data Staged:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration or other actions. It is not directly related to gathering information.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that the technique used to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails is **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**.

**Final Answer: C**
