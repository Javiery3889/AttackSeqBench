Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Gaining initial access through document-based exploits.
2. Executing malware using an updated MiniDuke loader.
3. Stealing credentials from various software.
4. Exporting certificates with private keys.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys**: This technique involves stealing private keys from certificates.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials from various sources.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**: This technique involves filtering passwords through a DLL. It does not directly relate to stealing credentials or exporting private keys.
- **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. It fits well with the step of stealing credentials from various software.
- **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks. It does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**: This technique involves establishing one-way communication. It does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves gaining access, executing malware, stealing credentials, and exporting private keys.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for stealing credentials and private keys.
- Among the answer choices, **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** (B) is the most relevant to the step of stealing credentials from various software.

### Final Answer: B
