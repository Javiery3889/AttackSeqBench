### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where targeted individuals are organized using campaign codes, credentials are stolen through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros, and the stolen credentials are transmitted to C2 servers.
   - The specific TTP of interest is the method used to capture user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending malicious files (like documents with embedded macros) to the target to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending malicious links to the target to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using spearphishing to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token:** This technique involves stealing access tokens from applications, which is not directly related to the spearphishing method described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the spearphishing method described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules, which is not directly related to the spearphishing method described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the spearphishing method described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros, is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is directly related to the method used to capture user credentials through such emails.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the technique that aligns with the spearphishing method described.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture** (Note: This is a misinterpretation in the context of the question. The correct technique should be T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, but based on the provided choices, B is the closest match to the context of capturing credentials through spearphishing.)

However, if we strictly adhere to the provided choices and the context of the question, the most plausible answer would be:

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture** (This is a misinterpretation, the correct answer should be T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, but based on the provided choices, B is the closest match to the context of capturing credentials through spearphishing.)
