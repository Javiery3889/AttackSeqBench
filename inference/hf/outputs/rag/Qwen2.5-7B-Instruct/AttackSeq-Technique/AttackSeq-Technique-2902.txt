### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs under the Collection tactic, specifically mentioning the use of 'yty' framework plugins 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots and 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Collection tactic and the technique T1113-Screen Capture, which aligns with the use of 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This technique is related to the exfiltration of data, but it does not directly follow the collection of screenshots and system information.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories** - This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, which is not directly related to the collection of screenshots and system information.
   - **C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** - This technique is also related to exfiltration, but it does not follow the collection of screenshots and system information.
   - **D: T1542.003-Bootkit** - This technique involves the use of a bootkit to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to the collection of screenshots and system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the technique that follows the collection of screenshots and system information. Since the question does not explicitly mention exfiltration or persistence, and the related TTPs do not provide a direct next step, the most logical next step in the attack sequence would be to use the collected data for further analysis or decision-making.

   - **Final Answer: None of the provided options directly follow the sequence of TTPs as described. However, if we must choose the closest option, T1113-Screen Capture (related to the use of 'dspcheck.exe') is the most relevant, but it does not have a direct next step in the provided options.**

Given the constraints and the provided options, the most plausible sequence would be to consider the next logical step in the attack lifecycle, which is not explicitly provided in the options. However, if we must choose, the closest related TTP is T1113-Screen Capture, but it does not have a direct next step in the provided options.
