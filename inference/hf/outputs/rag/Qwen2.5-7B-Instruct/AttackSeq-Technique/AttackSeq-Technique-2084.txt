Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. RIG EK fetches malware from the C&C infrastructure.
2. The malware is delivered using an obfuscated PowerShell script.
3. The malware is then transmitted securely using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques involved:
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique is relevant to the obfuscation of the PowerShell script.
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is relevant to the use of PowerShell for execution.
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is relevant to the deobfuscation or decoding of the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to communicate with the C&C server. Given that the malware is transmitted securely using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm, this technique aligns well with the secure transmission aspect of the question.

- **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is about signaling to establish a connection or to indicate the presence of malicious traffic. It does not directly relate to the secure transmission of the exploit code.

- **C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the system's search order to load malicious code. It does not align with the secure transmission of the exploit code.

- **D: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the traffic. While it can be used for secure transmission, it is not specifically mentioned in the question and does not directly relate to the use of the RC4 algorithm.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a secure transmission of the exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.
- Among the given choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** (A) is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the secure transmission aspect using encryption.

### Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
