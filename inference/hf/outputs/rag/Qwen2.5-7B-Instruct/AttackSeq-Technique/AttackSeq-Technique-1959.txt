Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where stolen credentials are used to persist via a VPN access, and then the threat actor configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence. We need to identify which TTP occurred before the persistence via WMI.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid user accounts to gain access to the system.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to the target network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique is directly related to using stolen credentials, which aligns with the question's mention of stolen credentials.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves establishing a connection to the target network, which could be via a VPN.

Given the sequence of events:
1. The threat actor uses stolen credentials (T1078-Valid Accounts).
2. The threat actor then uses these credentials to establish a persistent connection via a VPN (T1133-External Remote Services).
3. Finally, the threat actor configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The threat actor uses stolen credentials (T1078-Valid Accounts).
- **Step 2**: The threat actor uses these credentials to establish a persistent connection via a VPN (T1133-External Remote Services).
- **Step 3**: The threat actor then configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.

Based on this reasoning, the TTP that most likely occurred before the threat actor achieved persistence by configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence is the establishment of a persistent connection via a VPN.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
