### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon has gained user execution of malicious email attachments, and they need to ensure that the malicious modules execute at every reboot.
   - The key point here is ensuring that the malicious modules run persistently after reboots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Execution" as the tactic and "Malicious File" as the technique.
   - This indicates that the focus is on ensuring the malicious files (or modules) are executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious file at a specific time or on a schedule.
     - While this can ensure persistence, it is not the most direct method for ensuring execution at every reboot.
   - **B: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**
     - This technique involves adding a malicious DLL to the Windows logon process, which ensures the DLL is loaded every time a user logs on.
     - This method is more direct for ensuring execution at every reboot.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files to make them harder to detect and analyze.
     - This does not directly address the need for persistence or execution at every reboot.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This is a sub-technique of T1053, which involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks.
     - Similar to T1053, this can ensure persistence but is not the most direct method for every reboot.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the malicious modules execute at every reboot is **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**.

**Final Answer: B**
