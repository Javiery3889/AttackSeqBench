Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The adversary used discovery commands like PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log.
2. This was followed by exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, including logs, to understand the environment.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves collecting data from the system, which aligns with the extraction of log contents.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique involves clearing logs to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing data from a web portal, which does not align with the described sequence of extracting log contents and exfiltrating data.
- **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the extraction of log contents. However, it does not specify the method of exfiltration.
- **C: T1218.014-MMC**: This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to manage and view system information. While it could be part of the discovery phase, it does not directly align with the extraction and exfiltration of log contents.
- **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. The question states that the data is exfiltrated using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The adversary used discovery commands (PsLogList) to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log. This aligns with T1654-Log Enumeration.
2. The next step is to collect the extracted data, which aligns with T1119-Automated Collection.
3. The data is then exfiltrated using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services. This aligns with T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Discovery (T1654-Log Enumeration)
- Collection (T1119-Automated Collection)
- Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)

Therefore, the final answer is:
Final Answer: D
