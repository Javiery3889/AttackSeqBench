### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first exploited misconfigured Docker API ports to gain initial access, then deployed malicious container images that mimic popular packages.
   - The focus is on the initial access and the deployment of malicious content.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** The related TTPs mention "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application," which aligns with the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Execution (Tactic):** The related TTPs also mention "T1610-Deploy Container" and "T1204.003-Malicious Image," which align with the deployment of malicious container images.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**
     - This technique is not directly related to the initial access or the deployment of malicious content via Docker API ports.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique directly aligns with the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports, which is the first step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique is more about altering the execution flow of a process, which is not the first step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique is about gaining access to cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the misconfigured Docker API ports.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports, which is best represented by the technique "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application."

**Final Answer: B**
