Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Context**: PyFlash gathers system information and communicates with a hardcoded C&C server via HTTP while encrypting communication with AES-128 in CBC mode.
- **Key Points**:
  - System information gathering (T1082-System Information Discovery)
  - Communication with a C&C server (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography)
  - Encryption method (AES-128 in CBC mode)

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is relevant to the initial gathering of system information.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about decrypting or decoding information, which is relevant to the encryption method used.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique is about using symmetric cryptography for communication, which aligns with the encryption method mentioned (AES-128 in CBC mode).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or scripts, which is not directly related to the communication and encryption described.
- **Answer Choice B: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification**: This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions, which is not directly related to the communication and encryption described.
- **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy for communication, which is not mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where PyFlash gathers system information and then communicates with a C&C server using encrypted communication.
- The related TTPs indicate that the communication involves encryption (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography).
- The question specifically mentions AES-128 in CBC mode, which is a form of symmetric cryptography.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves the use of symmetric cryptography for communication.

**Final Answer: D**
