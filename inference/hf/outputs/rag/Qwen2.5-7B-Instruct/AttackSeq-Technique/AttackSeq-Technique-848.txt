### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where critical systems have been discovered, and valid credentials have been obtained to enable legitimate access within the target network.
   - The adversaries then move across the network to further their objectives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique involves using valid accounts to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique is similar to T1078.002 and involves using valid accounts to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** - This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with the command and control server. It does not directly relate to moving across the network after gaining access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification** - This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies to gain additional privileges or access. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly describe the movement across the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021.007-Cloud Services** - This technique involves using cloud services to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It does not directly describe the movement across the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to the network. While it can be part of the initial access, the question specifically mentions moving across the network after gaining access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**, as it aligns with the movement across the network after gaining access.

**Final Answer: D**
