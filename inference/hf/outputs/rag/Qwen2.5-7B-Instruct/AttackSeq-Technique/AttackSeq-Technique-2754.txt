Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malware is deployed and configured for persistence.
2. The malware evades detection.
3. Sensitive user activity data is collected.
4. The data is exfiltrated via HTTP GET posts and email to a compromised server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1115-Clipboard Data**
  - This technique involves stealing data from the clipboard. While it could be a method to collect sensitive data, it does not directly align with the exfiltration method (HTTP GET posts and email) mentioned in the question.

- **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which is not directly related to collecting and exfiltrating sensitive user activity data.

- **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing new capabilities, which is more about the development process rather than the specific TTPs related to data collection and exfiltration.

- **D: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
  - This technique involves accessing data from cloud storage. While it could be a method to collect data, it does not directly align with the exfiltration method (HTTP GET posts and email) mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the exfiltration methods mentioned (HTTP GET posts and email), the most relevant TTPs are:
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**

The question specifically mentions exfiltration via HTTP GET posts and email, which aligns more closely with **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
Final Answer: D
