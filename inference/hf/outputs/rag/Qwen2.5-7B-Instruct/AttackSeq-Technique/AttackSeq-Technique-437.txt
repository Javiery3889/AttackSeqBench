Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deceptive email campaigns and malicious attachments for initial access.
2. An AutoIt downloader that performs sandbox detection, retrieves installed software lists, and gathers system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and listing software installed on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing to gain initial access to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the target host, which is a broad category and does not specifically align with the detailed actions described (software discovery and sandbox detection).

- **Answer Choice B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
  - This technique involves determining the physical location of the target, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

- **Answer Choice C: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This technique directly aligns with the actions described in the question, as the AutoIt downloader is performing software discovery (retrieving installed software lists and gathering system information).

- **Answer Choice D: T1218.014-MMC**
  - This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to perform administrative tasks, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where initial access is gained through deceptive email campaigns and malicious attachments.
- The AutoIt downloader then performs specific actions such as sandbox detection, software discovery, and system information gathering.
- Among the given answer choices, **T1518-Software Discovery** (Answer Choice C) is the most specific and directly aligns with the actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: C
