### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving lightSpy malware, legitimate Apple developer certificates, payload.dylib, and CVE-2019-8605 for root privileges.
   - The key aspect is identifying the technique that most likely occurred before the malware employed these certificates and payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This involves the methods an attacker uses to get into a network.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This involves techniques used to avoid detection or analysis.
   - **Code Signing (Technique):** This involves using legitimate certificates to sign malicious code to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a system's integrity protection mechanisms. While it can be a part of defense evasion, it doesn't directly relate to the initial access or the exploitation of a specific vulnerability.
   - **B: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification:** This technique involves changing file and directory permissions. While it can be used for defense evasion, it is not directly related to the initial access or the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page or other publicly accessible content. This could be a plausible initial access method for exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **D: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution:** This technique involves executing a binary through a proxy or wrapper. While it can be used for defense evasion, it is not directly related to the initial access or the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of initial access and exploiting a public-facing application, is **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**. This technique aligns with the initial access tactic and could be the method used to exploit CVE-2019-8605.

**Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
