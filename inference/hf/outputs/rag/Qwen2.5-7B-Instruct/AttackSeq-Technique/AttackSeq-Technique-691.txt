### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WMI queries are used to identify installed antivirus products for defense evasion.
   - The next step in the sequence is gathering information such as the computer name, username, and operating system version.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Discovery" and the technique "T1082-System Information Discovery."
   - T1082-System Information Discovery involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the question's description of gathering system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery** - This technique involves identifying user accounts on a system. While it is related to discovery, it does not directly align with the specific information being gathered (computer name, username, OS version).
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing information or clicking on malicious links. It does not align with the technical gathering of system information.
   - **C: T1218.007-Msiexec** - This technique involves using the `msiexec` command to install or uninstall software. It does not align with the gathering of system information.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** - This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which could include gathering the computer name and username. However, it does not cover the operating system version.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is T1082-System Information Discovery, which directly aligns with the gathering of system details such as the computer name, username, and operating system version.

**Final Answer: T1082-System Information Discovery**
