### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a RAT (Remote Access Tool) variant, specifically Poison Ivy, uses DLL sideloading to evade defenses and then starts communicating with its C2 (Command and Control) servers using modified configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is already mentioned in the question and is about using DLL sideloading to evade defenses.
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is a repetition of the same technique, reinforcing its importance.
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding information, which could be part of the process of preparing for communication with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process, which is not directly related to communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data, which is not directly related to communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication, which is not directly related to communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the question's description of the RAT starting to communicate with its C2 servers.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
