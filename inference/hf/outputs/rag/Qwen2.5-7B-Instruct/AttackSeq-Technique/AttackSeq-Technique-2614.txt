### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already gained maximum privileges on a victim's machine through a Windows local privilege escalation exploit.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next to maintain access on the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Privilege Escalation" and "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" (T1068). This indicates that the focus is on maintaining access after the initial privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a social engineering technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is not directly related to maintaining access after privilege escalation.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run malicious code. This can be a method to maintain persistence and access after gaining privileges.
   - **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
     - This technique involves modifying user accounts to gain or maintain access. While it can be used to maintain access, it is more about changing account permissions rather than maintaining access through a scheduled task.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique involves compromising cloud accounts. It is not directly related to maintaining access on a local machine after privilege escalation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique to maintain access on the victim's machine after gaining maximum privileges is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, as it provides a method to ensure the attacker's code runs persistently.

**Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
