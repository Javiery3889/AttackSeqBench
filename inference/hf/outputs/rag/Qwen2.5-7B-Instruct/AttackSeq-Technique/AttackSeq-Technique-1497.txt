### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a PowerShell script named RogueRobin was executed and checked for sandbox environments using WMI queries and process enumeration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely supported the evasion of detection prior to establishing persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI to execute code or commands.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the environment to determine if it is a sandbox or other controlled environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**
     - This technique involves modifying or clearing the command history to avoid detection. However, the question does not mention any command history being modified or cleared, so this is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While this can be a part of evasion, the question does not specifically mention data encoding.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1497.001-System Checks**
     - This technique involves checking the environment to determine if it is a sandbox or other controlled environment. The question mentions that the script checked for sandbox environments using WMI queries and process enumeration, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**
     - This technique involves loading kernel modules or extensions to gain privileges or modify system behavior. The question does not mention any kernel-level actions, so this is less likely.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described actions is **T1497.001-System Checks**.

**Final Answer: C: T1497.001-System Checks**
