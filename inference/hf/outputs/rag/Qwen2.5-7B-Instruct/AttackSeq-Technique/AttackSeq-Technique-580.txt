### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: exploiting a vulnerability in SharePoint, installing the AntSword webshell, and using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - The next step in the sequence is to assess the content of the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique is about exploiting a service to gain access to a system. It aligns with the initial exploitation of SharePoint.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to extract credentials, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on a system. It is a common step after gaining access to assess the system's content.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control. It is not directly related to assessing the system's content.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves accessing cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1036.006-Space after Filename**
     - This technique involves using a space after a filename to bypass certain security mechanisms. It is not directly related to assessing the system's content.

### Final Answer:
Based on the described sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step in assessing the content of the compromised system would be to discover files and directories. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
