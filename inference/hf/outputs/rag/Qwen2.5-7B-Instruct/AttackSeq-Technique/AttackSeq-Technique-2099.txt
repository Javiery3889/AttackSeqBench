### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial step is exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files via spear phishing.
   - The next step in the sequence is to facilitate communication between the malware and the framework's cloud infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Exploit Public-Facing Application" as part of the T1190 technique.
   - The related TTPs also mention "Spearphishing Attachment" as part of the T1566 technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is related to the initial spear phishing attack but does not describe the communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.
   - **B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
     - This technique is about modifying file paths, which is not directly related to facilitating communication with a cloud infrastructure.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the communication path, which could be used to facilitate communication with a cloud infrastructure.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure, which aligns well with facilitating communication with a cloud infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
Based on the attack sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is facilitated by the use of a web service to communicate with the cloud infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
