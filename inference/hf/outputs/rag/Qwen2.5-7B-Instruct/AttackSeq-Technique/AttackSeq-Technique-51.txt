### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where initial access to target systems was achieved via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the gathering of information about potential victims before the initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and two specific techniques: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - These techniques are related to the initial access via phishing, which aligns with the question's context.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation** - This technique involves altering data to mislead or manipulate the victim. It does not directly relate to the gathering of information about potential victims.
   - **B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates** - This technique involves the use of digital certificates to establish trust. It is not directly related to the gathering of information about potential victims.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using phishing to gather information about the target. This aligns well with the question as it directly relates to the gathering of information about potential victims before the initial access.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases** - This technique involves searching open technical databases for information. While it can be used to gather information, it is not as directly related to the context of phishing as T1598-Phishing for Information.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is that the gathering of information about potential victims occurred through phishing. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information
