### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT41 has already deployed malware to execute operations within compromised systems.
   - The malware has been used to capture credentials through credential stealers and keyloggers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection** and **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** are directly related to the use of keyloggers to capture credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** and **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** further confirm the use of keyloggers for credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**
     - This technique is about generating multi-factor authentication requests, which is not directly related to the use of keyloggers or credential stealers.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the use of keyloggers to capture keystrokes and thus credentials.
   - **C: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking COM objects, which is not directly related to the use of keyloggers or credential stealers.
   - **D: T1565-Data Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating data, which could be relevant in the context of credential access but is not as directly aligned with the use of keyloggers as T1056-Input Capture.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that follows the use of malware to capture credentials through keyloggers is **T1056-Input Capture**.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
