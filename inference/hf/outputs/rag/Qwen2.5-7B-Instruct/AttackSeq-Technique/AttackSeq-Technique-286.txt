### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through spear-phishing documents or watering hole attacks.
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of the Elephant backdoor, which drops encoded blobs to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access techniques include spear-phishing links (T1566.001) and spear-phishing attachments (T1566.002).
   - Drive-by compromise (T1189) is also mentioned, which could be a method of initial access through a malicious website.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique is relevant to the execution of the Elephant backdoor, as it involves decoding the blobs dropped by the backdoor.
     - However, it does not directly relate to the initial access phase.
   - **B: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**
     - This technique is about using file transfer protocols to transfer files, which is not directly related to the initial access or the execution of the backdoor.
   - **C: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**
     - This technique involves smuggling data in HTML content, which could be relevant to a drive-by compromise (T1189) but not directly to the spear-phishing methods mentioned.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other actions. It is not directly related to the initial access or the execution of the backdoor.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the execution of the Elephant backdoor.
   - Given the context of initial access through spear-phishing, the most relevant technique would be one that directly supports the initial access phase.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the initial access through spear-phishing, is the technique that supports the initial delivery of the payload. Since the question does not directly mention a technique for initial access through spear-phishing, we need to infer the most relevant technique from the given options.

- **A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** is the most relevant to the execution phase but not the initial access phase.
- **B: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols** and **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** are not directly related to the initial access phase.
- **C: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling** is the most plausible for a drive-by compromise, but it is not directly related to the spear-phishing methods mentioned.

Given the context and the options provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the initial access through spear-phishing is:

**Final Answer: C: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**
