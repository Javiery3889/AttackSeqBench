### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Regin utilized its collection capabilities, which included features like capturing screenshots, stealing passwords, and crawling the file system.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Collection" and the technique "T1113-Screen Capture."
   - T1113-Screen Capture is directly related to the activity of capturing screenshots, which is one of the collection capabilities mentioned.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through a third party. It does not directly follow the collection activities described.
   - **B: T1090.004-Domain Fronting** - This is a sub-technique of T1090 and involves using domain fronting to hide the true destination of network traffic. It is not directly related to the collection activities.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to reduce the footprint of malware. It is not directly related to the collection activities.
   - **D: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication** - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to evade detection. It is not directly related to the collection activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be an activity that directly follows the collection of data, such as using the data collected for further malicious actions.
   - Since the question specifically mentions capturing screenshots (T1113-Screen Capture), the next logical step would be to use this data, which aligns with the use of shared modules (T1129-Shared Modules) to hide the data or use it in a way that is not easily detected.

However, the question asks for the most likely technique that occurred after the collection, and the most direct continuation of the collection activities would be to use the collected data in a way that is not easily detected or hidden. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules**
