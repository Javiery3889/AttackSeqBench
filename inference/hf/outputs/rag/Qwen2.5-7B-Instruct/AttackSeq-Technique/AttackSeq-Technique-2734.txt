### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group used a credential harvesting tool named Responder to acquire login credentials from a victim machine.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the credential harvesting.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques under the "Credential Access" tactic:
     - T1040-Network Sniffing
     - T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to extract credentials. It is a method to gather credentials after they have been harvested.
   - **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic and potentially steal credentials. It is a method to gather credentials but is more focused on the initial phase of credential harvesting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the credential harvesting, T1040-Network Sniffing is the most appropriate choice. It directly follows the harvesting of credentials and is a method to further extract and use the harvested credentials.

### Final Answer: A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding

**Note:** There seems to be a discrepancy in the provided answer choices. The correct answer based on the analysis should be T1040-Network Sniffing, but the closest matching choice provided is T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding, which is not directly related to the scenario described. If T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding is the closest match among the given choices, it would be the best answer, but ideally, T1040-Network Sniffing would be the correct choice.
