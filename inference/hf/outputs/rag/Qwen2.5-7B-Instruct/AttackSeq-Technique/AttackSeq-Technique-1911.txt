Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Reconnaissance with open-source pentesting tools.
2. Lateral movement using stolen MSP credentials.
3. Ensuring the malware remains active despite system reboots.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence.
- T1053.002-At: This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to run commands or scripts at a specified time.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique ensures the malware remains active despite system reboots.

- **Option A: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**
  - This technique is about using pluggable authentication modules to bypass authentication mechanisms. It does not directly address ensuring malware remains active after reboots.

- **Option B: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. While it can help in maintaining persistence, it does not specifically address the issue of ensuring the malware remains active after reboots.

- **Option C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from the system. While it can help in lateral movement, it does not directly address ensuring the malware remains active after reboots.

- **Option D: T1588.002-Tool**
  - This technique involves using a tool to maintain persistence. It is not a specific technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework and does not directly address the issue of ensuring the malware remains active after reboots.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the related TTPs, the most plausible technique for ensuring the malware remains active despite system reboots is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, as it directly addresses the issue of ensuring malware is executed at boot or logon.

Final Answer: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Option D)
