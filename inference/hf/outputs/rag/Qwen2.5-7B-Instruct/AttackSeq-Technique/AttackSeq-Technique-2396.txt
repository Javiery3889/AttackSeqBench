### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware first performs discovery activities, then communicates with compromised websites in South Korea and Europe to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Exfiltration" and the techniques are:
     - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
     - T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling (A):** This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols. It is not directly related to the exfiltration over a C2 channel or an unencrypted non-C2 protocol.
   - **T1574.014-AppDomainManager (B):** This technique is not related to exfiltration or communication with compromised websites.
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information (C):** This technique is about gathering information about the victim organization, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel (D):** This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication. However, the related TTPs mention exfiltration over a C2 channel and an unencrypted non-C2 protocol, which suggests that the communication is not necessarily encrypted.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves exfiltration over a C2 channel or an unencrypted non-C2 protocol. The answer choice that best fits this context is **T1573-Encrypted Channel (D)**, even though the related TTPs suggest unencrypted communication, the encrypted channel is the closest match among the given options.

**Final Answer: D**
