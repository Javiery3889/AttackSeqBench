Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The malware uses scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
2. It communicates with its C2 server using HTTP requests.
3. It employs a covert mechanism to ensure communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is relevant as the communication with the C2 server is part of the command and control process.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication.
- **Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels to ensure persistence and reliability of C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves using user execution to run malicious code. While it might be part of the initial infection vector, it does not directly address the communication aspect described in the question.
- **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. It is not directly related to the communication aspect described in the question.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. T1071.001 specifically mentions using web protocols (like HTTP), which aligns with the question's description of using HTTP requests.
- **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves tunneling data through a protocol to evade detection. While it could be a part of the covert mechanism, it is not directly mentioned in the question and is more about the method of communication rather than the protocol used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware using HTTP requests for C2 communication, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols as a relevant technique for C2 communication.
- T1071.001 specifically mentions using web protocols (like HTTP), which matches the question's description.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
