Let's break down the question and the related TTPs to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where TeamTNT compromised an exposed Weave Scope service to gain initial access. This initial access led to the deployment and execution of a coin miner payload. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial access and led to the deployment and execution of the payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves the attacker using a system service to execute malicious code.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves the attacker using a remote service to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves the attacker using a remote service to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves the execution of code in a serverless computing environment. While it is related to execution, it does not directly align with the context of deploying a coin miner payload through a compromised service.
- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the attacker using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This could be a plausible technique for executing a payload, but it is more general and does not specifically align with the context of a system service.
- **Answer Choice C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This technique involves the attacker injecting code into the memory of a process. This is a specific and targeted technique that could be used to deploy a coin miner payload, but it is more about memory manipulation rather than execution through a system service.
- **Answer Choice D: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves the attacker actively scanning for targets. While it is related to initial access, it does not align with the deployment and execution of a payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access technique (T1133-External Remote Services) is used to gain access to the system.
- The next step would be to use a technique that allows for the execution of the payload. Among the given choices, T1569-System Services (related to Tactic: Execution) is the most specific and relevant to deploying a coin miner payload through a system service.

### Final Answer: T1569-System Services
