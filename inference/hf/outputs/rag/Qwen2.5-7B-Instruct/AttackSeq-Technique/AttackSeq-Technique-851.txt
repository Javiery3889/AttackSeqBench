### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already collected relevant data and is preparing to exfiltrate it.
   - The key aspect is maintaining control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Collection Tactic:** T1074.002-Remote Data Staging: This technique involves staging data remotely, which is relevant to the data collection phase.
   - **Command and Control Tactic:** T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple channels for communication, which is crucial for maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1218.015-Electron Applications:** This technique is not directly related to maintaining control over the infrastructure through multiple communication stages. It is more about using Electron applications for persistence.
   - **B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique directly aligns with the need to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages. It involves using multiple channels for communication, which is a common method to ensure persistence and maintain access.
   - **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** While this technique involves bidirectional communication, it does not necessarily imply multiple stages or channels. It is more about the direction of communication.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access or perform actions. It does not directly address maintaining control through multiple communication stages.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitates keeping control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages is **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**.

Final Answer: B
