### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an embedded DLL file is decoded using a 10-byte XOR key. The next step in the sequence is to maintain the malware's presence for configuration updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence** - This is relevant as the malware needs to maintain its presence.
   - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** - This technique is related to loading a DLL file, which aligns with the decoding and execution of the DLL mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is relevant as the malware is trying to avoid detection.
   - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** - This technique is related to the decoding process described in the question.
   - **Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads** - This technique is related to embedding payloads, which aligns with the initial decoding of the DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring the malware runs when the system boots or when a user logs on. While this is a form of persistence, it does not directly relate to the decoding and execution of the DLL.
   - **B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution** - This technique involves resolving a resource at runtime, which is not directly related to the persistence aspect of maintaining the malware's presence.
   - **C: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery** - This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks, which is not related to maintaining the malware's presence.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts** - This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to maintaining the malware's presence through persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, as it directly relates to the loading of the decoded DLL and maintaining the malware's presence.
   - **Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** (Note: The correct answer choice should be T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, but based on the given choices, A is the closest match in context.)

Given the choices provided, the most plausible answer is:
**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
