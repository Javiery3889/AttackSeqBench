Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlueDelta gained initial access to a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (CVE-2020-35730). The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK technique was used to access credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Exploit Public-Facing Application" (T1190). This indicates that the attackers used an exploit to gain initial access to the system via a public-facing application.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client machine. While it could be part of the initial access, it doesn't directly relate to accessing credentials.
  
- **B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
  - This technique directly involves using an exploit to access credentials. Given that the question is about accessing credentials after gaining initial access, this seems to be the most relevant technique.
  
- **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which is not directly related to the immediate access and credential theft described in the question.
  
- **D: T1552.007-Container API**
  - This technique involves using container APIs to gain access or execute code. It is not directly related to the immediate credential access described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (T1190).
- The next step would logically be to use the gained access to exploit the system further to access credentials.
- Among the given options, T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access (B) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the question's requirement to access credentials after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer: B
