Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability through phishing campaigns.
2. Delivering payloads like SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT.
3. Enabling continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC addresses.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or control over the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing link to deliver malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a covert channel or exfiltrate data. While it could be relevant for maintaining communication, it doesn't directly address the continuous communication with hardcoded CnC addresses.
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial access. It is not relevant for maintaining continuous communication.
- **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel traffic through another protocol. It could be used to maintain communication, but it is not specifically about hardcoded CnC addresses.
- **D: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves creating a task or service that masquerades as a legitimate system process to maintain persistence. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it does not directly address the continuous communication with hardcoded CnC addresses.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on maintaining continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC addresses.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol (A) is the most relevant technique for establishing and maintaining communication over application layer protocols.
- T1566-Phishing (B) is already mentioned and is not relevant for maintaining communication.
- T1572-Protocol Tunneling (C) can be used for communication but does not specifically address hardcoded CnC addresses.
- T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service (D) is about maintaining persistence but not specifically about communication.

### Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
