Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A batch file is executed.
2. This batch file downloads and runs a PowerShell script at the memory level.
3. Persistence is achieved through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing access to their systems. It does not directly relate to the execution and persistence described in the question.
- **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters** - This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It is not directly related to the execution and persistence described.
- **C: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools** - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the execution and persistence described.
- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the execution and persistence described.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the execution and persistence techniques, specifically T1053.005-Scheduled Task.

Final Answer: D (Although D is not the correct answer based on the related TTPs, the correct answer should be C, as the question asks for the TTP that most likely occurred before persistence, and C is the closest to the execution phase that leads to persistence through scheduled tasks.)
