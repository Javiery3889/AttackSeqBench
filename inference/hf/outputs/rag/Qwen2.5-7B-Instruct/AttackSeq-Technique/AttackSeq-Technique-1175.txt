### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already exploited vulnerable services for initial access.
   - The next step is to maintain access before deploying custom malware (WellMess or WellMail) for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique is about moving laterally within the network after initial access, but it doesn't directly relate to maintaining access post-initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access, which aligns with the need to maintain access after initial compromise.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services for initial access, which is not directly relevant to maintaining access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1137.002-Office Test:** This is not a valid ATT&CK technique and does not fit the context.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** While phishing can be used for initial access, it is not typically used for maintaining access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity:** This technique involves using hybrid identities to maintain access, which is a plausible method for maintaining access after initial compromise.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique directly involves using valid accounts to maintain access, which is a common and effective method for maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to maintain access before deploying custom malware is using valid accounts. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
