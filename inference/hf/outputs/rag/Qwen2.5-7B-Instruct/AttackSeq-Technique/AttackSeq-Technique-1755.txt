Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that Shuckworm utilized malicious documents to execute their Pterodo backdoor and scheduled tasks to support their foothold. The next step is to determine which ATT&CK technique ensured the backdoor remained active across system reboots.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to ensure the backdoor remains active.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed at system boot or logon. While this is a valid persistence technique, the question specifically mentions that the backdoor was scheduled to remain active, which aligns more closely with scheduled tasks.
- **Answer Choice B: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves manipulating user or system accounts. This is not directly related to ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.
- **Answer Choice C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This technique involves using malicious images to execute malware. This is not directly related to ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute malware. While this can be part of the attack, it does not directly address the persistence aspect of ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that the backdoor was scheduled to remain active, which aligns with the use of scheduled tasks.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1053.005-Scheduled Task, which is directly related to ensuring the backdoor remains active across system reboots.
- The other answer choices do not directly address the persistence aspect of the backdoor remaining active across reboots.

### Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

However, upon re-evaluation, the most accurate and relevant TTP from the provided list is T1053.005-Scheduled Task, which is not listed as an answer choice. Given the options, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
