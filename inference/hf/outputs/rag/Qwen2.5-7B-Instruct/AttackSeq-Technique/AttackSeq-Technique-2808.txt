### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Grandoreiro first collected information about its victims and then used RealThinClient SDK over HTTP for Command and Control.
   - The specific information collected includes the computer name, username, operating system version, and bitness.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," which aligns with the information-gathering phase.
   - The technique "T1082-System Information Discovery" is directly related to the collection of system information, which matches the question's description.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools** - This technique is about deploying software, which is not directly related to the information collection phase.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is relevant to the Command and Control phase but not the information collection phase.
   - **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning** - This technique is about manipulating network traffic, which is not directly related to the information collection phase.
   - **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** - This technique involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to the information collection phase described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The technique that most likely occurred after the collection of information about the victims is "T1082-System Information Discovery."

### Final Answer: B
