Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. TG-3279 performed network scanning.
2. An action occurred after the network scanning.
3. The group then established persistence for the Conpee plugin framework.
4. The persistence was done without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery** (This is the network scanning mentioned in the question.)
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** (This is one form of persistence, but it involves modifying the Windows Registry or startup items, which is not what the question specifies.)
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** (This is another form of persistence that does not involve modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically follows network scanning and leads to persistence without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.

- **Option A: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique involves using external services, which does not directly follow network scanning and does not align with the persistence requirement.
- **Option B: T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs** - This technique is about clearing logs, which does not align with the persistence requirement.
- **Option C: T1205-Traffic Signaling** - This technique involves signaling traffic, which does not align with the persistence requirement.
- **Option D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves using cloud accounts, which could be a method of persistence without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the persistence was done without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.
- Among the given options, only **T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** fits this requirement as it involves using cloud accounts for persistence, which does not require modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.

### Final Answer: D
