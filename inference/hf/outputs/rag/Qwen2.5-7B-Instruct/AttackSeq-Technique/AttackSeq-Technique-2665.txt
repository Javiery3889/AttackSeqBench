### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol with encrypted communication.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique supports the campaign's ability to maintain communication if a primary server becomes unavailable.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic "Command and Control" and the Technique "T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol," which aligns with the custom TCP-based protocol.
   - Additionally, the related TTPs also mention "T1008-Fallback Channels," which is directly related to maintaining communication in the event of a primary server becoming unavailable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels** - This technique is specifically designed to maintain communication by having alternative communication channels in place if the primary channel is unavailable. This directly addresses the question's requirement.
   - **B: T1124-System Time Discovery** - This technique is about discovering the system time on a target system, which is not related to maintaining communication in the event of a server becoming unavailable.
   - **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution** - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names, which is more about DNS resolution and not about maintaining communication in the event of a server becoming unavailable.
   - **D: T1574.012-COR_PROFILER** - This technique is about profiling the target environment, which is not related to maintaining communication in the event of a server becoming unavailable.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels
