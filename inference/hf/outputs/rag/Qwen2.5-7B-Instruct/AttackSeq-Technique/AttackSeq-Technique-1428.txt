Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Leveraging exploits on Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.
2. Strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website.
3. Leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the initial access and execution phases:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves executing code on the client machine.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page or other public-facing application.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**: This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute code. It does not directly relate to the exploitation of Internet Explorer or the web compromise of the Daily NK website.
- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which aligns with the exploitation of Internet Explorer through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.
- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts on the system to avoid detection. It is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase rather than the initial access and execution phases.
- **D: T1003.003-NTDS**: This technique involves accessing NTDS.dit files, which are specific to Windows domain controllers and are not directly related to the described attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial access through exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is relevant to this phase.
- The sequence of TTPs should logically follow the initial access and execution phases.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting Internet Explorer through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411).
- Execution: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (executing code on the client machine).

Therefore, the answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: B
