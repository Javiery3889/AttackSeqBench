### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where the actors developed a toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs, after a certain technique occurred.
   - The key point is to identify which technique most likely happened before the development of the toolset.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development**
     - **T1588.002-Tool:** This technique involves the development of custom tools.
     - **T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring and using domains.
     - **T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves the use of malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. However, it does not directly relate to the development of a toolset.
   - **B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure, which could be a precursor to developing a toolset, but it is more about setting up the infrastructure rather than the development of tools.
   - **C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
     - This technique involves splitting resources, which is not directly related to the development of a toolset.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting public-facing applications, which is a common initial step but does not directly relate to the development of a toolset.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where the actors developed a toolset after a certain technique, is likely to be a technique that involves the initial setup or resource development. Among the given options, **T1588.002-Tool** (development of custom tools) is the most relevant to the development of a toolset.
   - The technique that most likely occurred before the development of the toolset would be a technique that involves acquiring or setting up the necessary resources or infrastructure, which aligns with **T1583.001-Domains** (acquiring and using domains).

### Final Answer: B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure
