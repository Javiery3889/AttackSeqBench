Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that before StellarParticle accessed data from Information Repositories (T1213), they used AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory. We need to determine which technique most likely occurred after the initial gathering of information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which is not directly relevant to the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves discovering system owners or users, which is also not directly relevant.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This is the final technique mentioned, which involves accessing data from information repositories.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a technique that logically follows the use of AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the gathering of information from Active Directory.
- **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services, which is not directly related to the gathering of information from Active Directory.
- **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache, which is not directly related to the gathering of information from Active Directory.
- **D: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**: This technique involves using unsecured credentials, which could be relevant if the gathered information from Active Directory included credentials that were not secured.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets are used to gather information from Active Directory.
- The next logical step would be to ensure that the credentials used are not unsecured, as this would be a critical step in securing the data gathered.
- T1552-Unsecured Credentials (D) is the most plausible technique that would follow the gathering of information from Active Directory, as it ensures that the credentials used are secure.

### Final Answer: D
