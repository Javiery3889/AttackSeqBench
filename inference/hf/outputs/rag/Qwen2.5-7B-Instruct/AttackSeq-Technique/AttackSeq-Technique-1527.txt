Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus Group:
1. Initial access via a spear-phishing campaign with macro-embedded documents.
2. An unknown technique that occurs after initial access.
3. Persistence achieved by dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
  - This TTP is related to the initial access via a spear-phishing campaign.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
  - This TTP is related to persistence, specifically the modification of shortcuts to achieve persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the technique that logically follows the initial access and precedes persistence.

- **Answer Choice A: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process. It is not directly related to the spear-phishing campaign or persistence via LNK files.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**
  - This technique involves stealing or impersonating tokens to gain elevated privileges. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly follow the spear-phishing campaign or lead to persistence via LNK files.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering running processes. While it can be used to identify and manipulate processes, it does not directly follow the spear-phishing campaign or lead to persistence via LNK files.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process, which can be used to execute malicious code. This technique can logically follow the initial access via a spear-phishing campaign and can lead to persistence via LNK files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spear-phishing campaign (T1566.002) provides initial access.
- The next step would be to execute the malicious payload, which can be done through various techniques, but T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is a plausible method to execute the payload.
- Finally, the persistence is achieved by dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder (T1547.009).

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial access via spear-phishing (T1566.002)
- Execution of the payload (T1574-Hijack Execution Flow)
- Persistence via LNK file (T1547.009)

### Final Answer: D
