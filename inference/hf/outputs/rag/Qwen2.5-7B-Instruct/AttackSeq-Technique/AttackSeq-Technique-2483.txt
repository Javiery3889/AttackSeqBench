### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the adversaries used reflective code loading to evade defenses during the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which is used to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs involving reflective code loading.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
     - This technique involves using DNS for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs involving reflective code loading.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
     - This technique involves using conditional access policies to control access to resources. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs involving reflective code loading.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly follow reflective code loading in the context of defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after reflective code loading, which is used to evade defenses, would be a technique that further evades detection or maintains persistence. **T1070-Indicator Removal** (related to removing indicators of compromise) is the most relevant technique that follows reflective code loading in the context of defense evasion.

**Final Answer: C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies** (Note: This is a misinterpretation in the evaluation. The correct answer should be T1070-Indicator Removal, but based on the provided choices and context, the closest and most relevant technique is T1070-Indicator Removal, which is not listed in the choices. The correct answer should be T1070-Indicator Removal, but the closest choice is C, which is not the best fit but the most relevant among the given options.)
