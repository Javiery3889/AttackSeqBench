Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Dridex uses obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection. The next step is to communicate data such as computer name and botnet ID number with its Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**: This technique involves using time-based methods to evade detection, which is not directly related to the communication aspect.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication, but the question specifies encrypted POST requests, not DNS.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection, which aligns with the obfuscation mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Encrypted POST requests are a form of application layer protocol communication, making this a strong candidate.
- **Answer Choice B: T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique involves evading debuggers, which is already mentioned in the question and does not directly relate to the communication aspect.
- **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding, which could be part of the obfuscation but does not directly address the communication method.
- **Answer Choice D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique involves determining physical locations, which is not relevant to the communication aspect described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection, which aligns with the obfuscation mentioned in T1001-Data Obfuscation.
- The next step is to communicate data via encrypted POST requests, which is a form of application layer protocol communication.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique for this communication method.

### Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
