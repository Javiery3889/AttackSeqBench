Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the initial access technique used by Mustang Panda, which involved deploying malicious payloads using embedded '.lnk' files. This indicates that the technique used for initial access should be related to the use of malicious links.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique is about creating a web shell to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to the initial access using '.lnk' files.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using malicious links to execute code. This is directly related to the use of '.lnk' files for initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly involve the use of '.lnk' files.
- **B: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making the attacker's presence appear legitimate. It does not directly involve the use of '.lnk' files.
- **C: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**: This technique involves modifying cloud configurations to gain unauthorized access. It is not related to the use of '.lnk' files.
- **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default or weak credentials. It does not directly involve the use of '.lnk' files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies the use of embedded '.lnk' files for initial access.
- The related TTPs mention T1204.001-Malicious Link, which directly involves the use of malicious links.
- None of the other techniques (A, B, C, D) are related to the use of '.lnk' files for initial access.

### Final Answer: D
