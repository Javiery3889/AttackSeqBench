### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT10 staged data for exfiltration using multi-part archives in the Collection phase, leveraging remote command execution scripts.
   - The key points are:
     - The data staging is for exfiltration.
     - The exfiltration uses multi-part archives.
     - Remote command execution scripts are involved.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - T1074.001-Local Data Staging
     - T1074.002-Remote Data Staging
   - Both of these techniques are under the Collection tactic and involve data staging, which aligns with the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving a domain name to an IP address. It does not directly relate to data staging or exfiltration.
   - **B: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules, which is not directly related to data staging or exfiltration.
   - **C: T1074-Data Staged**
     - This technique involves the act of staging data, which is directly related to the question. However, it is a general term and does not specify the method of staging.
   - **D: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**
     - This technique involves using a virtual private server, which could be used for remote data staging but is not specifically about data staging or exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of data staging for exfiltration, is T1074.001-Local Data Staging or T1074.002-Remote Data Staging. Since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the exfiltration, and both 001 and 002 are related to data staging, the most specific and relevant technique is T1074.002-Remote Data Staging, as it directly involves remote data staging, which aligns with the use of remote command execution scripts.

**Final Answer: D**
