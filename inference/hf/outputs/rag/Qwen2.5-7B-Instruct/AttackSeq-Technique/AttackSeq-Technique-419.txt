### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus Group first exploited known vulnerabilities and used password spraying to gain initial access to cryptocurrency trading platforms.
   - Before these actions, the question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred as adversaries targeted users and their systems during the gathering of information for their attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.003-Password Spraying:** This technique is directly mentioned in the question and is used after gaining initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is also mentioned and is used to gain initial access to the systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging:** Keylogging is a technique used to capture keystrokes, which can be used to gather credentials. However, it is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and is not the most likely technique for gathering information before gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1110-Brute Force:** Brute force is a method of gaining access by trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. While it can be used to gather information, it is not the most likely technique in the context of the question.
   - **C: T1596.005-Scan Databases:** This technique involves scanning databases to gather information. While it can be used, it is not the most direct or common method for gathering information before gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim, such as names, addresses, and other personal details. This is a common and direct method for adversaries to gather information before launching more targeted attacks.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is that the adversaries gathered victim identity information before exploiting vulnerabilities and using password spraying. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
