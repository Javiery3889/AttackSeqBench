Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Welcome Chat app ensures persistence by auto-starting at device boot.
2. An action occurs after persistence but before exfiltrating data.
3. The data exfiltrated includes GPS location and user photos.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data locally before exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring persistence by auto-starting at boot or logon.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1546.011-Application Shimming**
  - This technique involves modifying an application to perform additional actions, which could be related to persistence. However, it does not directly align with the sequence described in the question.

- **B: T1614-System Location Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering system location information. While it could be a step in the data collection process, it does not directly follow persistence and precede exfiltration.

- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering system information, which could be a step in the data collection process. However, it does not directly follow persistence and precede exfiltration.

- **D: T1123-Audio Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing audio data. While it could be part of the data collection process, it does not directly follow persistence and precede exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the action occurs after persistence (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) and before exfiltration.
- The related TTPs mention T1074.001-Local Data Staging, which involves staging data locally before exfiltration.
- Among the given choices, T1082-System Information Discovery is the closest to the described sequence, as it involves discovering system information, which could be part of the data collection process.

### Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery
