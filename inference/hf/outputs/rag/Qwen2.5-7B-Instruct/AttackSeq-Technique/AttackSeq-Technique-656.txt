Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory and gained initial access to the victim's device using malicious Office documents. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange** - This technique involves the use of the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves using malicious Office documents to gain initial access to the victim's device.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy** - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It does not directly follow the exploitation of DDE and gaining initial access via malicious Office documents.
- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it is related to execution, it does not directly follow the exploitation of DDE and gaining initial access via malicious Office documents.
- **Answer Choice C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium** - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium. It does not directly follow the exploitation of DDE and gaining initial access via malicious Office documents.
- **Answer Choice D: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange** - This technique involves the use of the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory. It directly follows the exploitation of DDE and gaining initial access via malicious Office documents.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of DDE to execute commands in memory and gaining initial access via malicious Office documents.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange is the technique used for executing commands in memory.
- The sequence of TTPs should logically follow the initial access and execution steps.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly follows the exploitation of DDE and gaining initial access via malicious Office documents.

**Final Answer: D: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
