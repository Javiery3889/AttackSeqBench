Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Stolen digital certificates are used to make kernel-mode drivers appear legitimate.
2. Stuxnet then propagates laterally through networks using vulnerabilities like MS08-067 RPC.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Lateral Movement** techniques:
  - T1210: Exploitation of Remote Services
  - T1091: Replication Through Removable Media
  - T1570: Lateral Tool Transfer

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the TTP that best fits the sequence described in the question.

- **Stolen Digital Certificates for Legitimate Drivers**: This suggests a technique that involves making malicious activities appear legitimate. This is closely related to **T1014-Rootkit**, which involves hiding or disguising malicious activities.
- **Propagation Using MS08-067 RPC**: This is a specific vulnerability that Stuxnet used for lateral movement. This aligns with **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Stolen Digital Certificates for Legitimate Drivers**: This is a form of hiding or disguising malicious activities, which aligns with **T1014-Rootkit**.
2. **Propagation Using MS08-067 RPC**: This is a specific method of lateral movement, which aligns with **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **T1014-Rootkit** (to make the kernel-mode drivers appear legitimate)
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** (to propagate laterally using MS08-067 RPC)

However, the question asks for a single answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence. Given the options provided, the best fit is:

Final Answer: A: T1014-Rootkit
