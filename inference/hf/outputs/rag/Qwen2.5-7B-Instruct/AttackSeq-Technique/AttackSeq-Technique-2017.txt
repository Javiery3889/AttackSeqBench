Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Welcome Chat app targeted Arabic-speaking Android users through a dedicated website.
2. An action occurred after this targeting but before ensuring the app's functionality was activated every time the device started.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a malicious website or drive-by download.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malware or malicious software is executed every time the device starts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTPs fit the sequence described in the question:
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique aligns with the initial targeting through a dedicated website.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique aligns with ensuring the app's functionality is activated every time the device starts.

Given the sequence in the question, the action that occurs after the initial targeting (through a website) but before ensuring the app's functionality is activated every time the device starts must be a step that enables the app to run automatically.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This is the initial action where the app is downloaded and installed through a malicious website.
2. **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This is the final action where the app is configured to run automatically every time the device starts.

The TTP that fits between these two is likely to be a step that ensures the app is installed and ready to be activated automatically. However, the question does not explicitly mention the installation step, but it is implied.

Given the choices provided:
- **A: T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **B: T1593.001-Social Media**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is related to exploiting a public-facing application, which could be part of the initial compromise but does not fit the sequence as well as T1547.
- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This is the same as C, so it is not a valid choice.

The most plausible TTP that fits the sequence is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**, as it ensures the app's functionality is activated every time the device starts, which is the final step in the sequence.

### Final Answer: D
