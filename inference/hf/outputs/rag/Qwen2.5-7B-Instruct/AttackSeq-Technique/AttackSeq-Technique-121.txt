### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled them to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is Lateral Movement.
   - The technique mentioned is T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique involves using chat messages to exfiltrate data or deliver malicious content. It does not align with the described scenario of tunneling RDP traffic for lateral movement.
   - **Option B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. While it could be relevant for maintaining stealth, it does not directly address the exploitation of systems via RDP.
   - **Option C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. Given that the question mentions tunneling RDP traffic, this technique is highly relevant as it directly addresses the exploitation of a remote service (RDP) for lateral movement.
   - **Option D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using SMB or Windows admin shares to access files or execute code. While it is a valid technique for lateral movement, the question specifically mentions RDP, making T1021.002 less directly relevant compared to T1210.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
