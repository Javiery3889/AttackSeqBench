Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Infamous Chisel's netd component collects files from the local system.
2. Files are exfiltrated at regular intervals.
3. Exfiltration uses a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated exfiltration of data.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing network traffic. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration process described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564.003-Hidden Window**
  - This technique involves creating a hidden window to hide the attacker's presence. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration process.

- **Answer Choice C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
  - This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data. Given that the question mentions exfiltration at regular intervals, this technique aligns well with the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
  - This technique involves exfiltration over a webhook. While it is related to exfiltration, the question specifies exfiltration over a Tor hidden service and SSH connections, which is more specific and aligns better with T1041.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where files are collected from the local system and then exfiltrated at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
- T1029-Scheduled Transfer (Answer Choice C) fits well with the regular interval exfiltration.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (related TTP) aligns with the use of a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Given the context and the specific details provided in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes scheduled transfer for regular exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
