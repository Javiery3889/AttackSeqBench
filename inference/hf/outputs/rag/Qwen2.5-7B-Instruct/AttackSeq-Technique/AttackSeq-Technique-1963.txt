Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exporting saved passwords from Chrome browser installations.
2. Utilizing renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.
3. Maintaining persistence in the environment.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves renaming files or processes to match legitimate names or locations to evade detection.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves using legitimate-looking files or processes to hide malicious activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique aligns best with the described sequence of actions, particularly focusing on maintaining persistence.

- **T1205.002-Socket Filters**: This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of actions.
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to maintain persistence. While it can be a method of persistence, it does not directly relate to the described sequence of actions.
- **T1136-Create Account**: This technique involves creating new user accounts to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of actions.
- **T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**: This technique involves using a helper DLL with the `netsh` command to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of actions.

### Step 4: Reasoning
The sequence of actions described in the question involves:
1. Exporting saved passwords (likely to gather credentials).
2. Renaming utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries (to evade detection).

Given the related TTPs, **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** and **T1036-Masquerading** are the most relevant. However, the question specifically asks about maintaining persistence after the described actions. 

- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** is a sub-technique of **T1036-Masquerading** and focuses on renaming files or processes to match legitimate names or locations.
- **T1036-Masquerading** is a broader technique that includes renaming files or processes to hide malicious activities.

### Final Answer
The most plausible technique for maintaining persistence after the described actions is **T1036-Masquerading**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services (Note: This is a misinterpretation in the provided choices. The correct choice should be T1036-Masquerading, but since it's not listed, the closest related technique is B: T1021-Remote Services, which is a broader persistence technique.)
