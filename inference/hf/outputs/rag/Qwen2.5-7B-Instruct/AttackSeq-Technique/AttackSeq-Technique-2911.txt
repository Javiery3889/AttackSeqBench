Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT15 evaded policy settings by copying and patching `cmd.exe` to facilitate the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor. This indicates a sequence of techniques that involve both evasion and persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.002-Disable Windows Event Logging**: This technique is about evading detection by disabling event logging.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**: This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table, which is not directly related to the described evasion and persistence techniques.
- **B: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves impairing or degrading the effectiveness of defensive measures. While it is related to defense evasion, it is a broader category and does not specifically address the copying and patching of `cmd.exe`.
- **C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**: This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not directly related to the described evasion and persistence techniques.
- **D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not directly related to the described evasion and persistence techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes APT15 evading policy settings by copying and patching `cmd.exe` to facilitate the installation of a backdoor. This indicates a specific technique related to modifying the system to evade detection and maintain persistence.
- The related TTPs mention techniques such as modifying the registry (T1112) and disabling event logging (T1562.002), which are consistent with the described evasion techniques.
- Among the answer choices, **T1562-Impair Defenses** (B) is the most relevant as it encompasses the broader category of impairing defenses, which includes the specific technique of disabling event logging (T1562.002).

### Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses
