Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A fake document is executed using the RichEdit function.
2. The malware then prepares and protects shellcode in memory using `localAlloc` and `VirtualProtect`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves loading code into memory without using the Windows loader.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves hiding the true nature of a file or process.
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding to reveal the true nature of a file or information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - This technique involves intercepting file paths that are not quoted, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves redirecting the execution flow of a process. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the execution of a fake document using RichEdit.

- **Answer Choice C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves using resource forks in files to hide malicious code. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the execution of a fake document using RichEdit.

- **Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It is more about the initial transfer of tools and does not directly follow the execution of a fake document using RichEdit.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible technique that follows the execution of a fake document using the RichEdit function and leads to the preparation and protection of shellcode in memory is **T1620-Reflective Code Loading**. This technique is directly related to loading code into memory, which aligns with the next step in the sequence.

**Final Answer: B**
