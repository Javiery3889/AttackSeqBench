### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the BlackEnergy 3 malware communicated with its C2 server via HTTP, sending localization data and keyboard layout details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1071.001-Web Protocols." This indicates that the malware is using web protocols to communicate with its C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 communication. While it could be a step in the process, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for the malware to communicate via HTTP.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication. Since the question specifies that the malware communicates via HTTP, this technique is directly relevant.
   - **C: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access**
     - This technique involves temporary access to cloud resources. It is not directly related to the communication method (HTTP) or the data being sent (localization and keyboard layout details).
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves the user executing a malicious payload. While this is a common initial step in many malware attacks, it is not specifically related to the communication method or the data being sent.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first uses an application layer protocol (HTTP) to communicate with its C2 server. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the malware communicated via HTTP is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
