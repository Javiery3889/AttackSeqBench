### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Infamous Chisel malware collects files based on predefined criteria and uses a Tor hidden service for exfiltration.
   - It also mentions that SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) functionality and SSH relays are used for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel to exfiltrate data.
   - **Hidden Files and Directories (T1564.001):** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the exfiltration or communication methods mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols for command and control, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for command and control, which could be relevant to using a Tor hidden service.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**
     - This technique involves inhibiting system recovery, which is not directly related to the exfiltration or communication methods mentioned.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of using a Tor hidden service for exfiltration and implementing SSH relays for communication, aligns best with **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**.

### Final Answer: C
