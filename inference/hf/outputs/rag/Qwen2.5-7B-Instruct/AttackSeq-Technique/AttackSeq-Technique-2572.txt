Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Emissary Trojan achieves persistence by writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll` and installing as a service to run the exported function `ServiceMain`.
2. It then communicates with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique involves creating a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.004-IIS Components**: This technique involves using IIS components to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves creating files or registry entries that are executed when the system boots or a user logs on. While it is a persistence technique, it does not directly relate to the HTTP communication with C2 servers.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS) to exfiltrate data or communicate with C2 servers. This aligns well with the part of the question that mentions HTTP requests for communication.

- **Answer Choice C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client system. It does not directly relate to the communication aspect described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is blocked. While it is a persistence technique, it does not directly relate to the HTTP communication with C2 servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence through a Windows service (`T1543.003-Windows Service`), which is correctly identified in the related TTPs.
- The communication with C2 servers using HTTP requests is the key part of the question.
- Among the answer choices, `T1071-Application Layer Protocol` is the only one that directly addresses the use of an application layer protocol (HTTP) for communication.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
