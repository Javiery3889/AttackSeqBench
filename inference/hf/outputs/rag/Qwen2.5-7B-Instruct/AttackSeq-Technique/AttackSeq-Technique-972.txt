### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the APT (Naikon APT) first gathers information about user accounts, software, and active processes.
   - It mentions the use of fileless techniques to avoid detection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique enabled the APT to enumerate network connections of the victim’s machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," which aligns with the question's context of gathering information.
   - The related technique is T1049-System Network Connections Discovery, which directly pertains to the enumeration of network connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**:
     - This technique is specifically about discovering network connections, which matches the question's requirement to enumerate network connections.
   - **B: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**:
     - This technique involves impersonating protocols or services, which is not directly related to enumerating network connections.
   - **C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**:
     - This technique is about discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not relevant to the question's focus on network connections.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**:
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is not directly related to enumerating network connections.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the use of T1049-System Network Connections Discovery to enumerate network connections of the victim’s machine.

**Final Answer: A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
