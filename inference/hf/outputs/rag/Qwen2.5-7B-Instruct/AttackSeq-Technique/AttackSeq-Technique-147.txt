### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving exploiting Microsoft Exchange Server, using the PowerLess Backdoor for reconnaissance and credential dumping.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique enabled persistence through scheduled tasks and autostart execution during boot or logon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques:
     - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run at a later time or date.
     - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves adding files to directories that are processed or run by the operating system during the boot process or user logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. While it can be used for persistence, it does not specifically mention scheduled tasks or autostart execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique directly aligns with the requirement of enabling persistence through autostart execution during boot or logon. It is a common method for malware to ensure it runs every time the system boots or a user logs in.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to load malicious code. It is not directly related to scheduled tasks or autostart execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**
     - This technique involves loading kernel modules or extensions to gain persistence. While it can be used for persistence, it does not specifically mention scheduled tasks or autostart execution.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that enables persistence through scheduled tasks and autostart execution during boot or logon is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B**
