### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where AdFind and tasklist.exe are used for Discovery.
   - The next step in the sequence is accessing data from Information Repositories for Collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention T1057-Process Discovery and T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which are both part of the Discovery tactic.
   - These techniques are used to gather information about the environment, which aligns with the initial steps of the attack sequence described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid user accounts to gain access to systems. While it is a common technique, it does not directly relate to the process discovery or file and directory discovery mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
     - This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It is not directly related to the initial steps of process and file discovery.
   - **C: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking a session to a remote service. While it can be part of an attack, it is not directly related to the process and file discovery steps mentioned.
   - **D: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to gain access to systems. It can be part of the initial discovery phase, where the attacker might use remote services to gather information about the environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve techniques that are directly related to the initial discovery phase.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** (D) is the most relevant technique as it aligns with the use of tools like AdFind and tasklist.exe for process and file discovery.

### Final Answer: D
