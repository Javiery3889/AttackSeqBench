Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT28 initially harvests credentials via spear-phishing and employs OLDBAIT. Following this, the question asks which ATT&CK technique allowed APT28 to move deeper into the victim networks after exploiting internet-facing servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: Techniques T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1078-Valid Accounts are mentioned.
- **Reconnaissance**: Technique T1589.001-Credentials is mentioned.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided context:

- **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting a service or application to gain access to a system. Given that the question mentions exploiting internet-facing servers, this technique seems relevant.
  
- **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - This technique involves using cloud services for malicious purposes. While it could be relevant, the question specifically mentions exploiting internet-facing servers, which might not directly involve cloud services.
  
- **C: T1653-Power Settings**
  - This technique involves manipulating power settings to achieve a malicious objective. It does not seem directly related to the exploitation of internet-facing servers or moving deeper into the network.
  
- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a useful technique for maintaining persistence, it does not directly address the initial exploitation of internet-facing servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where APT28 initially gains access through spear-phishing and OLDBAIT, and then moves deeper into the network.
- The related TTPs mention exploiting public-facing applications (T1190) and using valid accounts (T1078) for initial access.
- Exploiting internet-facing servers (which aligns with T1190) would allow APT28 to gain initial access and then move deeper into the network.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the exploitation of internet-facing servers, which aligns with T1210.

### Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
