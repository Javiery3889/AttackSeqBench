Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor is used to steal Google Chrome credentials, and then pings to the C2 server are transmitted at regular intervals. We need to identify which TTP occurred before the pings to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering internet connections, which could be relevant to finding a C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering permission groups, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website, which could be a method to deliver the backdoor but does not directly relate to the pings to the C2 server.
- **Answer Choice C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
  - This technique involves accessing data from cloud storage, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting data automatically, which could be relevant to the pings to the C2 server after the credentials have been stolen.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor is used to steal Google Chrome credentials (T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers).
- After stealing the credentials, the attacker needs to find a way to communicate with the C2 server.
- Internet Connection Discovery (T1016.001) is a plausible technique for the attacker to discover the C2 server's IP or domain.
- Once the C2 server is discovered, the attacker can start pinging it at regular intervals (T1119-Automated Collection).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that Internet Connection Discovery (T1016.001) occurred before the pings to the C2 server.

### Final Answer: D
