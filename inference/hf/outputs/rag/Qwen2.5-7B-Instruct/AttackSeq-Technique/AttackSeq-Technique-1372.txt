Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information (reconnaissance).
2. Leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using a service to deliver spearphishing emails, which aligns with the use of HTTPS landing pages.
- **T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves stealing credentials, which aligns with the harvesting of credentials via mimicry.
- **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using links in spearphishing emails, which can be part of the attack sequence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059.002-AppleScript**: This technique involves using AppleScript to execute commands on macOS. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **B: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**: This technique involves creating a Kerberos ticket that has the privileges of a domain administrator. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is part of reconnaissance but does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves creating fake web pages to steal credentials, which aligns with the described sequence of TTPs, especially the use of HTTPS landing pages to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where personal contact information is stolen, followed by the use of HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials.
- The related TTPs mention spearphishing techniques, which can involve the use of HTTPS landing pages.
- Among the answer choices, T1606-Forge Web Credentials (D) is the most relevant and aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: D
