### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Carbanak used Cobalt Strike to map the network and enumerate remote systems.
   - The next step in the sequence is moving laterally across the infrastructure to find critical information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating remote systems, which aligns with the initial step of mapping the network and enumerating remote systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB/Windows admin shares to move laterally, which is the next step after discovering remote systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally, which is also a step in lateral movement but not directly related to the initial network mapping and enumeration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1652-Device Driver Discovery** is not directly related to the initial network mapping and enumeration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping** is more likely to occur after the initial network mapping and enumeration, as it involves stealing credentials, which is a step after discovering and enumerating systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification** is also more likely to occur after the initial network mapping and enumeration, as it involves modifying permissions, which is a step after discovering and enumerating systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1018-Remote System Discovery** directly aligns with the initial step of mapping the network and enumerating remote systems, making it the most plausible next step before moving laterally.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery
