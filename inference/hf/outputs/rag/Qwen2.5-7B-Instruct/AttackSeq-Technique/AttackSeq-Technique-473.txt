### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where OnionDuke has gathered information on antivirus software or firewalls and then connected to hardcoded C&C URLs.
   - The key points are:
     - Information gathering on security software (antivirus, firewalls).
     - Connection to hardcoded C&C URLs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**:
     - This technique involves identifying and gathering information about security software on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**:
     - This technique involves exploiting the target's defenses to avoid detection or mitigate security controls.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery**:
     - This technique involves identifying and gathering information about software on the target system, which can include security software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**:
     - This technique involves evading debugger-based detection mechanisms. It does not directly relate to gathering information on security software or connecting to C&C URLs.
   - **Option B: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**:
     - This technique involves exploiting the target's defenses, which could be relevant after gathering information on security software. However, it is more about exploiting defenses rather than directly connecting to C&C URLs.
   - **Option C: T1518-Software Discovery**:
     - This technique involves identifying and gathering information about software on the target system, which aligns with the initial step of gathering information on antivirus software or firewalls.
   - **Option D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**:
     - This technique involves using a malicious link in a spearphishing email. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of gathering information on security software and connecting to C&C URLs.

### Final Answer:
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described in the question, is that the initial step was gathering information on security software (antivirus, firewalls), which aligns with the T1518-Software Discovery technique. After this, the next step would likely be exploiting the gathered information to connect to hardcoded C&C URLs, which aligns with the T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion technique.
- However, since the question asks for the most likely technique that occurred after the initial gathering of information, the best answer choice is the one that directly follows the initial gathering step.

**Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery**
