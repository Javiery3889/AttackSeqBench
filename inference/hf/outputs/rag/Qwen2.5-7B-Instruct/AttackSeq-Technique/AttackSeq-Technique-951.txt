Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities during the Collection phase:
1. Staging data by scanning for files matching specific extensions.
2. Creating a file containing paths of all files to exfiltrate.
3. Communicating with the C&C server over ports 80 or 443.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (C2) Tactic**: The related TTPs mention T1571-Non-Standard Port, which indicates that the malware communicates with the C&C server over non-standard ports (80 or 443 in this case).
- **Exfiltration Tactic**: The related TTPs also mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which suggests that the data exfiltration occurs over the same channel used for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1543.001-Launch Agent**: This technique involves the use of a launch agent to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data or the communication with the C&C server.
- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the described data collection and exfiltration process.
- **C: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services. While it is related to exfiltration, it does not specifically mention the use of the C&C channel.
- **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data. It is more closely related to the described exfiltration process, and the related TTPs mention exfiltration over the C2 channel, which aligns with the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of activities that include data collection and exfiltration over the C&C channel.
- The related TTPs specifically mention exfiltration over the C2 channel, which aligns with the described communication over ports 80 or 443.
- Among the answer choices, T1020-Automated Exfiltration (D) is the most relevant as it directly involves automated exfiltration and can be performed over the same channel used for C2 communication.

### Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
