### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has discovered folders related to antivirus and banking software during the Discovery stage.
   - The next step in the sequence is to gather user activity data on banking sites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique is about identifying security software, which aligns with the initial discovery of antivirus and banking software.
     - **T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the browser, which could be relevant for understanding user activity on banking sites.
     - **T1518-Software Discovery**: This is a broader technique that includes discovering software, which again aligns with the initial discovery of banking software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about ensuring the malware runs at system boot or logon. It does not directly relate to gathering user activity data on banking sites.
   - **B: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data from a remote system, which is not directly related to gathering user activity data on banking sites.
   - **C: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to gathering user activity data on banking sites.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which can be used to gather user activity data on banking sites, such as login credentials or transaction details.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the malware has discovered folders related to antivirus and banking software, it would next use the technique to gather user activity data on banking sites, which is best represented by **T1113-Screen Capture**.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
