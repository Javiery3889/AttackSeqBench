Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. LYCEUM gained additional access from credentials gathered via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1.
2. The next step was targeting HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to acquire information for further operational planning.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to find and exploit other systems.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the entry point into the target network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering accounts and their associated information. While it is related to reconnaissance, it does not directly follow the credential gathering via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 and precede the spearphishing attack.

- **B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It is not directly related to the sequence of gaining access and then using spearphishing.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to the target network. It is more related to initial access rather than the sequence described.

- **D: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
  - This technique involves using the gathered credentials to gain access to systems. It directly follows the credential gathering via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 and is a logical step before using spearphishing to acquire additional information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: LYCEUM gained additional access from credentials gathered via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1.
- **Step 2**: The next step would be to use these credentials to move laterally within the network, which aligns with the T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access technique.
- **Step 3**: After gaining access to other systems, the attackers would then target HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to acquire additional information.

Based on the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
