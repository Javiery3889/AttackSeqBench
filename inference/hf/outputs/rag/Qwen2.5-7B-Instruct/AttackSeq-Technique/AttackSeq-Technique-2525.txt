### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before BlueDelta exploited Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities to gather specific types of information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step in the attack lifecycle where the adversary gains access to the target environment.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.
   - **Discovery (Tactic):** This is the process of finding information about the target environment.
   - **System Information Discovery (Technique):** This involves gathering information about the system, such as system language, version, and configuration.
   - **Software Discovery (Technique):** This involves identifying software and services running on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing:** This technique involves using stolen or guessed credentials to gain access. It is not directly related to the exploitation of Roundcube vulnerabilities or the gathering of specific information.
   - **B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the target host, which could be relevant but is not as specific as the techniques mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1614.001-System Language Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system language, which is a subset of system information discovery but not as comprehensive as the information gathered in the question.
   - **D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network configuration details, which aligns well with the question as it involves gathering network configuration, owner/user details, and network connections.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is **D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**. This technique aligns best with the specific types of information (network configuration, owner/user details, and network connections) that BlueDelta gathered after exploiting the Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities.

Final Answer: D
