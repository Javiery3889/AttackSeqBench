Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting CVE-2015-2545 via spear phishing emails for initial access.
2. Achieving persistence using an ActiveSetup registry key.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure after these steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
  - **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is related to the initial access via exploiting a vulnerability.
  - **Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is related to the spear phishing emails used for initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. It is a plausible choice as it aligns with the need to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure after gaining initial access.

- **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
  - This technique involves using legitimate administrative tools or mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to communication with the attacker's infrastructure.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. Since the question already mentions spear phishing emails for initial access, this technique is not relevant for the communication phase.

- **D: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass external network security controls. While it could be used for communication, it is not the most direct or common technique for initial communication with the attacker's infrastructure after gaining access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes initial access via spear phishing and persistence via an ActiveSetup registry key.
- The related TTPs confirm that the initial access was via spear phishing.
- The most plausible technique for communicating with the attacker's infrastructure after gaining access would be an application layer protocol, as it directly addresses the need to establish a communication channel.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
