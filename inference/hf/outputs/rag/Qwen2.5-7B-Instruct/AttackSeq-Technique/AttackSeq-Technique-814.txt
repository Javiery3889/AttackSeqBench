### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware is deployed through malicious websites linked in spear phishing emails.
   - The next step in the sequence involves establishing connections to the attacker's infrastructure using domains to evade network detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Link," which aligns with the initial deployment of malware through malicious websites in spear phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is related to the initial deployment of malware through phishing, but it does not specifically address the establishment of connections using domains.
   - **B: T1001.002-Steganography**
     - Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret text or data. It is not directly related to establishing connections using domains.
   - **C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - A dead drop resolver is a technique used to resolve a dead drop (a location where information is exchanged) using a domain name. This aligns well with the question's requirement to establish connections using domains for evasion.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it is related to C2, it does not specifically address the use of domains for evasion.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's requirement to establish connections to the attacker's infrastructure using domains for potential network detection evasion is **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**.

**Final Answer: C**
