### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with phishing emails to achieve initial access.
   - The next step involves the Sayad malware ensuring it embeds all required malicious components without downloading additional content.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Link," which aligns with the phishing emails used to achieve initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1588.004-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to establish trust and legitimacy. It is not directly related to embedding components or ensuring no additional downloads.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it could be relevant to the malware's behavior, it does not directly address the embedding of components.
   - **C: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves enumerating logs to gather information about the target environment. It is not directly related to the embedding of components or ensuring no additional downloads.
   - **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
     - This technique involves staging capabilities to ensure the malware can perform its intended functions. It aligns well with the idea of embedding all required components without downloading additional content, which is a key aspect of the Sayad malware's behavior.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1608-Stage Capabilities
