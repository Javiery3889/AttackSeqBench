### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: retrieving a gist snippet from GitHub, parsing commands, and gathering system information.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after the SLUB backdoor is used to collect data from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques for discovery, specifically T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery).
   - These techniques align with the initial actions described in the question (retrieving and parsing commands, gathering system information).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking** - This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials. It does not directly relate to the initial discovery and data collection actions.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay** - This technique involves poisoning network protocols to steal credentials or data. It is more related to network-level attacks and does not directly follow the described discovery actions.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses** - This technique involves disabling or evading security controls. While it could be a follow-up action, it does not directly relate to the data collection process.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. Given that the SLUB backdoor is used to collect data, capturing the screen could be a plausible follow-up action to gather more detailed information about the victim's activities.

### Final Answer:
Based on the described sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial discovery and data collection, the attacker would use the SLUB backdoor to collect data and then capture the screen to gather more detailed information.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
