Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a SLUB backdoor retrieves commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet and obtains the username and computer name. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1485-Data Destruction**
  - This technique involves the attacker destroying or erasing data. It does not logically follow the retrieval of commands and system information. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

- **B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves the attacker using a web service to perform actions. While it is related to web services, it does not directly follow the retrieval of commands and system information. It is less likely to be the correct answer.

- **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves the attacker discovering the system owner or user. The question mentions that the SLUB backdoor obtained the username and computer name, which aligns with this technique. However, the question asks for what occurred after this action.

- **D: T1102-Web Service**
  - This is the same as option B and is less likely to be the correct answer for the same reasons.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given that the question asks for what occurred after the SLUB backdoor performed its discovery process, and the related TTPs mention T1033-System Owner/User Discovery, it is logical to assume that the next step in the attack sequence would be to use this information for further actions. However, none of the provided options directly follow the discovery process. The closest option that could be inferred to follow is a technique that might use the discovered information, such as establishing a web service to communicate with the attacker.

Since none of the provided options directly follow the discovery process, and the question asks for the most plausible sequence, the best choice would be the one that is most closely related to the context of the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
