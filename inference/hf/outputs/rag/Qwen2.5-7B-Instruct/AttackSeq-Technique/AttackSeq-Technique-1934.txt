Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an infection sequence where:
1. `sysOptimizer.bat` collects personal files.
2. `sysCrt32.exe` initializes execution components.
3. Data is transferred securely to FTP servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data to an external location.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique most likely occurred to transfer the collected data securely to the FTP servers.

- **Option A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique fits well with the description of transferring data to an external location (FTP servers) in an automated manner.
- **Option B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a command or script. While it could be part of the process, it does not directly describe the transfer of data to FTP servers.
- **Option C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the transfer of data to FTP servers.
- **Option D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is similar to FTP but more specific to text storage. However, FTP is a more general and commonly used method for file transfer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the transfer of collected data to FTP servers, which aligns with the description of T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
- T1020 specifically mentions automated transfer to an external location, which fits the scenario of transferring collected data to FTP servers.
- The other options do not directly describe the transfer of data to FTP servers in the same way.

### Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
