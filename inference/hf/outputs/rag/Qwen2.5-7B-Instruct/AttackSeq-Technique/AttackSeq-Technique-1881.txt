### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13 to establish persistence and execute commands.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using trojanized versions of KeePass binaries.
     2. Establishing persistence.
     3. Executing commands via `cmd.exe` using the BLUEAGAVE backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
     - This technique involves modifying or replacing software to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
     - This technique involves modifying the authentication process to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1098.005-Device Registration**
     - This technique is about registering a device with a network or system, which does not align with the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting a security identifier (SID) history, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
     - This technique involves compromising host software binaries, which aligns with the use of trojanized versions of KeePass binaries to establish persistence.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary** occurred before the other steps. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: D**
