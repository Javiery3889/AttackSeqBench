Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers used ransomware to disrupt operations in healthcare facilities. The attackers stole data before encrypting copies for ransom demands. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial ransomware attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact
- Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
  - This technique involves disrupting network services, which is not directly related to the ransomware attack described in the question. The question focuses on data theft and encryption, not network disruption.

- **B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
  - This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which aligns with the scenario where attackers stole data and then encrypted copies for ransom demands. This technique directly corresponds to the ransomware attack described.

- **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the ransomware attack described. The question focuses on data theft and encryption, not process manipulation.

- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While this could be part of the ransomware attack, it is not the most direct TTP that follows the initial data theft and encryption.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a ransomware attack that involved stealing data and then encrypting copies for ransom demands.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact, which directly aligns with the scenario of encrypting data for impact.
- Among the answer choices, T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact (B) is the most relevant and directly corresponds to the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer: B
