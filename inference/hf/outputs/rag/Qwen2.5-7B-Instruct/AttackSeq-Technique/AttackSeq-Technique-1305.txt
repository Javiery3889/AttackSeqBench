Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware collects data from the local system.
2. Stolen credentials are exfiltrated to a command and control server using standard application layer protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the collection of data from the local system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. While it is related to credential theft, it does not directly describe the collection of data from the local system.
- **Answer Choice B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique directly matches the description of collecting data from the local system, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice C: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware. It does not directly describe the collection of data from the local system.
- **Answer Choice D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not directly related to the local system data collection described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the malware collected data from the local system before exfiltrating stolen credentials.
- The related TTPs indicate that T1005-Data from Local System is the technique for collecting data from the local system.
- T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the technique for exfiltrating the data, which occurs after the data collection.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first collected data from the local system (T1005-Data from Local System) before exfiltrating the stolen credentials.

**Final Answer: B**
