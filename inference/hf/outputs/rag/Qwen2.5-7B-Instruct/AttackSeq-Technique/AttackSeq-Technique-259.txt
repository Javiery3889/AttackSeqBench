Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Persistence is established via a service and a registry Run key.
2. ShadowPad samples are padded to over 50MB.
3. The third file in three-file execution chains is deleted to remove traces of malicious activity.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Persistence**: T1543.003-Windows Service, T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
- **Defense Evasion**: T1070.009-Clear Persistence

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs.

#### Option A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
- This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of persistence and artifact removal.

#### Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts
- This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to avoid detection. The deletion of the third file in three-file execution chains to remove traces of malicious activity aligns well with this technique.

#### Option C: T1098.003-Additional Cloud Roles
- This technique involves using additional cloud roles to gain access or maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of persistence and artifact removal.

#### Option D: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion
- This technique involves using time-based evasion to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of persistence and artifact removal.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence via a service and registry Run key, which aligns with T1543.003 and T1547.001.
- The deletion of the third file in three-file execution chains to remove traces of malicious activity is a form of hiding or obfuscating artifacts, which aligns with T1564-Hide Artifacts.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts.

### Final Answer: B
