Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Dropping Elephant used spear-phishing emails with exploit documents for initial access.
2. An unknown technique occurred after this.
3. The technique employed encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This aligns with the initial access via spear-phishing emails with exploit documents.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique is related to bypassing detection, which aligns with the use of encoded blobs to download additional malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a technique that logically follows the initial access and precedes the use of encoded blobs for downloading additional malware.

- **A: T1059.011-Lua**: This technique involves using Lua scripts, which is not directly related to the spear-phishing or encoded blob techniques.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter, which is also not directly related to the spear-phishing or encoded blob techniques.
- **C: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts, which could be a step after initial access but does not directly relate to encoded blobs.
- **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves using credentials from password stores, which could be a step after initial access and before downloading additional malware, but it does not directly relate to encoded blobs.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the technique after initial access (spear-phishing) and before encoded blobs for downloading additional malware is likely to be a technique that involves some form of persistence or credential harvesting, which could be used to download additional malware.

However, none of the provided options directly align with the use of encoded blobs. The closest option that could be part of the sequence is **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** (D), as it involves credential harvesting, which could be a step before downloading additional malware.

Final Answer: D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
