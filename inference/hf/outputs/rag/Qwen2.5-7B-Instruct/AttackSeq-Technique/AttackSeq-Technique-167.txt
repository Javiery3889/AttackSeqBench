Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Defense evasion methods are used, such as redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services.
2. The goal is to access credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing credentials by presenting a web portal that mimics a legitimate login page.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation**: This technique involves using methods to make the attack appear legitimate, such as impersonating legitimate services.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

- **A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets**: This technique involves accessing local security authority (LSA) secrets, which is not directly related to the described phishing and credential access scenario.
- **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is a method of defense evasion but not directly related to the credential access through phishing.
- **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities to support the attack, which is not directly related to the specific TTPs described.
- **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the scenario of presenting a phishing page to capture credentials. The sub-technique T1056.003-Web Portal Capture specifically mentions capturing credentials through a web portal that mimics a legitimate login page, which fits the described scenario.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to legitimate-looking services and then presented with a phishing page to capture credentials.
- The related TTPs mention T1056.003-Web Portal Capture, which directly aligns with the described scenario of presenting a phishing page to capture credentials.
- The other techniques do not fit the specific scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: D**
