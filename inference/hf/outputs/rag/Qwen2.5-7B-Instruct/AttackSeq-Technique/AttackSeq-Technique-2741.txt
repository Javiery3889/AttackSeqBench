### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a dropper ensures persistence by repeatedly executing `iassvcs.exe` with each command line execution.
   - The dropper creates the `IISWebClient` directory in `%appdata%` during its execution phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques under the Persistence tactic:
     - **T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to maintain persistence.
     - **T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification:** This technique involves modifying shell configuration files to maintain persistence, but it is not relevant to the Windows environment described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or update software. While it can be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to ensuring persistence through repeated execution of a specific executable.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for specific files or directories using wordlists. It is not directly related to ensuring persistence through repeated execution of an executable.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client system. While it can be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to ensuring persistence through repeated execution of an executable.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While it can be part of the post-exploitation phase, it does not directly relate to ensuring persistence through repeated execution of an executable.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is **T1543.003-Windows Service**, as it directly involves creating or modifying a Windows service to ensure persistence by repeatedly executing `iassvcs.exe`.

### Final Answer: C
