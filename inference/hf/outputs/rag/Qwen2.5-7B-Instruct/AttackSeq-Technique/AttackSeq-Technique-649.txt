Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The attacker uses RAT capabilities to gather system and network information.
2. The attacker encrypts C2 traffic in an HTTP request.
3. The Comfoo C2 server acts as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**
- **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves embedding malicious content in shared files or documents. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
- **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server. The Comfoo C2 server acting as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console aligns well with this technique.
- **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for C2. While it could be relevant, it does not directly describe the relay point functionality.
- **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which does not align with the described sequence of actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Comfoo C2 server acting as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console is a clear indication of a proxy server being used.
- T1090-Proxy directly describes the use of a proxy to route traffic, which matches the described scenario.

### Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy
