### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred before Emissary Panda exploited CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) and used stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - The technique must precede the exploitation of EternalBlue.
     - The technique must enable or facilitate the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Lateral Movement," and the technique is "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1210).
   - This indicates that the question is focused on techniques that enable the attacker to move laterally within the network.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which could be used to gain access to systems with stolen credentials. However, it does not necessarily precede the exploitation of EternalBlue.
   - **B: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering services and their associated network locations. This could be a precursor to exploiting EternalBlue, as it would help identify vulnerable services.
   - **C: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying firewalls to facilitate access. While it could be used to enable lateral movement, it is more about creating a path rather than directly enabling the use of stolen credentials.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves deploying software to target systems. While it could be used to deploy tools that facilitate lateral movement, it is not directly related to the use of stolen credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **B: T1046-Network Service Discovery** is the most plausible sequence of TTPs. It directly relates to identifying the services that EternalBlue could exploit, and it logically precedes the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.

### Final Answer: B: T1046-Network Service Discovery
