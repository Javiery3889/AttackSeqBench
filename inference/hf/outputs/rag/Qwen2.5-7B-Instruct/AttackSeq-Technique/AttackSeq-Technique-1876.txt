### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks.
   - This implies that the technique in question should be an initial access technique that precedes the exploitation of external servers and the use of web shells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to a network. This is a plausible initial access technique.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves creating a web shell to maintain persistence on a compromised system. This is a technique that occurs after initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a network. This is also a plausible initial access technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1596.004-CDNs:** This technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host malicious content. While it can be used for initial access, it is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and does not align as closely with the exploitation of external servers and web shells.
   - **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into image files to execute malicious payloads. It is not directly related to the exploitation of external servers or web shells.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. While it can be part of an attack, it is not specifically an initial access technique and does not align as closely with the exploitation of external servers and web shells.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network. While it can be part of the attack lifecycle, it is not an initial access technique and does not directly precede the exploitation of external servers and web shells.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the exploitation of a public-facing application (T1190) to gain initial access, which then leads to the use of web shells (T1505.003) to maintain persistence.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the exploitation of external servers and the use of web shells is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

**Final Answer: A: T1596.004-CDNs** (Note: The correct answer based on the provided related TTPs and the question context should be T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, but since T1190 is not listed as an option, the closest and most plausible option is T1596.004-CDNs, which is a plausible initial access technique.)
