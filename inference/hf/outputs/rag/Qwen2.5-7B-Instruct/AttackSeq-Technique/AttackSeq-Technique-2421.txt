Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection and maintain backdoor connections, specifically mentioning the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to maintain access to the target network.
- **Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using one protocol to tunnel through another to bypass network defenses.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems.
- **Technique: T1021.004-SSH**: This technique involves using SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access and command execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
  - This technique involves running a virtual machine or container to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.
- **Answer Choice B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
  - This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary, which could be relevant to using legitimate tools like `plink.exe` to execute commands. However, it does not specifically mention the use of `plink.exe` or RDP over SSH.
- **Answer Choice C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves deploying software to target systems. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.
- **Answer Choice D: T1137.006-Add-ins**
  - This technique involves adding or modifying software components. It does not directly relate to the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH, which is a specific technique related to SSH (T1021.004-SSH).
- The related TTPs include T1572-Protocol Tunneling, which is relevant to using one protocol to tunnel through another to bypass network defenses.
- The use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH is a form of indirect command execution, which aligns with T1202-Indirect Command Execution.

Given the context and the specific mention of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of indirect command execution.

### Final Answer: B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution
