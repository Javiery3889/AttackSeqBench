Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery by enumerating files and directories using APIs such as `FindFirstFileW`.
2. Extracting system information using functions like `GetComputerNameA`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution** and **Technique: T1106-Native API**: This suggests that the actor is using native APIs to perform actions.
- **Tactic: Discovery** and **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This confirms that the actor is performing file and directory discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - This technique matches the first part of the sequence (enumerating files and directories).
  - However, it does not describe the next step (extracting system information).

- **B: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
  - This technique is not directly related to the actions described in the question. It involves using Visual Basic for scripting, which is not mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the actions of enumerating files and directories or extracting system information.

- **D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
  - This technique involves communication between processes, which could be a plausible next step after discovering system information. However, it is not directly related to the specific actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the actor first discovers files and directories and then extracts system information.
- The related TTPs confirm that the actor is using native APIs for discovery.
- Among the answer choices, T1083-File and Directory Discovery (A) matches the first part of the sequence, but it does not describe the next step.
- The next logical step after discovering files and directories and extracting system information would be to use that information to perform further actions, such as inter-process communication (D).

### Final Answer: D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication
