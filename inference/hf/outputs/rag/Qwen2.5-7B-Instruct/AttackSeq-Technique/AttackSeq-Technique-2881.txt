### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Bisonal malware used an RC4 cipher with a specific key to encrypt C2 address strings and hardcoded values for an initial HTTP POST connection.
   - The key "78563412" and the use of RC4 for encryption are critical details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** The malware is evading defenses.
   - **Encrypted/Encoded File (Technique):** The malware uses encryption (RC4) to encode its C2 address strings and hardcoded values.
   - **Command and Control (Tactic):** The malware establishes a connection using HTTP POST.
   - **Symmetric Cryptography (Technique):** The use of RC4 for encryption falls under this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. While the question mentions an HTTP POST connection, this does not directly address the encryption or key usage.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. The question does not mention any social engineering or user interaction.
   - **C: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH for command and control. The question specifies HTTP POST, not SSH.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using one protocol to hide the use of another protocol. While the question mentions HTTP POST, it does not indicate that the HTTP POST is being used to hide another protocol.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the encryption and the specific technique used for command and control.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** (related to the use of RC4 encryption) and **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File** (related to the encoding of C2 address strings and hardcoded values) are directly relevant to the question.
   - However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the encryption, which is the command and control technique.

Given the options and the context, the best fit is the command and control technique that aligns with the HTTP POST connection.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
