### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the adversary gains access to the victim's network entry points (such as a VPN or Citrix) after performing credential stuffing against remote services.
   - The goal is to identify which MITRE ATT&CK technique facilitated this tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "External Remote Services," which aligns with the scenario of gaining access to network entry points.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves the use of valid user accounts to gain access to systems. While it is relevant to the use of valid credentials, it does not specifically address the use of remote services.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**
     - This technique is about hiding email content from security tools. It does not align with the scenario of gaining access to network entry points.
   - **C: T1200-Hardware Additions**
     - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access. It does not fit the scenario of using remote services.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system to identify potential vulnerabilities or access points. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly facilitate the initial access via remote services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible technique that facilitated the tactic to gain access to the victim's network entry points after credential stuffing is **T1133-External Remote Services**. This technique directly involves the use of remote services to gain access, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: T1078-Valid Accounts** (Note: The correct answer based on the provided related TTPs is T1133-External Remote Services, but since the choices do not include T1133, the closest match is T1078-Valid Accounts.)
