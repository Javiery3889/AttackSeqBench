### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading up to APT28 gaining initial access via spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.
   - The sequence starts with bots geographically distributed across different countries scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are under the Tactic: Initial Access, and the specific technique mentioned is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is the technique used for the final step in the sequence, which is the spear phishing attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1564.003-Hidden Window:** This technique is about creating a hidden window to hide malicious activity. It does not fit the sequence as it is not related to scanning or identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks or systems to identify potential targets. It aligns well with the description of bots scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves modifying system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the scanning and identification of vulnerable systems.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning:** This is the same as T1595, which involves scanning networks or systems to identify potential targets. It aligns well with the description of bots scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the bots geographically distributed across different countries scanned IP ranges and identified vulnerable systems using the T1595-Active Scanning technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning**
