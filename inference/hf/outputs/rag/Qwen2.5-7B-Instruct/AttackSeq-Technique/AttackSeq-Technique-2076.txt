Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Whitefly has already compromised additional machines using stolen credentials. The next step in the sequence is mapping the network and identifying further systems for infection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating remote systems.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as the initial step (stolen credentials).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique is not directly related to the network mapping and discovery of additional systems.
- **Answer Choice B: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique is more about discovering containers and resources, which is not the primary focus of the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique directly aligns with the next step in the sequence, which is mapping the network and identifying further systems for infection.
- **Answer Choice D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as the initial step. It does not fit as the next step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that Whitefly has already used stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.
- The next step in the sequence is mapping the network and identifying further systems for infection.
- Among the given choices, T1018-Remote System Discovery (C) is the most relevant technique for the next step in the sequence, as it directly involves discovering and enumerating remote systems.

### Final Answer: C
