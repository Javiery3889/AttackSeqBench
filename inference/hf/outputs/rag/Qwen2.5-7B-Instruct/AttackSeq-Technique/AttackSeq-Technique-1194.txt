### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a dropper (BlackEnergy) executes "vba_macro.exe" using a macro-enabled Word document.
   - The dropper then builds strings and runs them in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Execution."
   - The technique mentioned is "T1059.005-Visual Basic," which is related to using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying files in locations that are executed when a user logs on or the system boots. It does not directly relate to the execution of strings in memory.
   - **B: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to exfiltrate or move data. It does not fit the context of executing strings in memory.
   - **C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into an image file (e.g., a DLL) to execute it. While it involves execution, it does not directly relate to the execution of strings in memory.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not application layer protocols (e.g., ICMP, UDP) for data exfiltration or command and control. It does not fit the context of executing strings in memory.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of executing strings in memory, is not directly listed among the choices. However, the closest and most relevant technique is **T1059.005-Visual Basic**, which is related to the use of VBA macros. The next logical step after executing "vba_macro.exe" would be to ensure the macro is executed, which aligns with the execution tactic.

   - **Final Answer: C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection** (Although this is not the best fit, it is the closest to the execution of strings in memory among the given choices.)

However, if we were to strictly follow the question and the related TTPs, the most relevant technique would be **T1059.005-Visual Basic**, but it is not listed as an answer choice. Therefore, the best answer among the given choices is:

**Final Answer: C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**
