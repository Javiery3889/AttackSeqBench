### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already discovered system details such as usernames, computer names, and RDP session IDs.
   - The next step in the sequence is SparrowDoor probing files in directories to obtain their names, attributes, or other metadata.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system's owner or users, which aligns with discovering usernames and computer names.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about files and directories, which aligns with probing files in directories to obtain their names, attributes, or other metadata.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1614.001-System Language Discovery** - This technique involves discovering the system's language, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1046-Network Service Discovery** - This technique involves discovering services running on a network, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client system, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about files and directories, which directly aligns with the next step in the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
