Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Derusbi gathered system information about the victim's host.
2. Communication was established with the command and control (C2) server via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is the overarching tactic that encompasses the communication with the C2 server.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique specifically involves using web protocols for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique is about gathering system information, which is the first step mentioned in the question. However, it does not describe the communication with the C2 server.

- **B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves bidirectional communication, which could be relevant for the C2 communication. However, it does not specifically mention the use of web protocols.

- **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**
  - This technique is about making asynchronous procedure calls, which is not directly related to the HTTP POST requests mentioned in the question.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. T1071.001 specifically mentions web protocols, which aligns with the HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where system information is gathered first, followed by establishing communication with the C2 server.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is directly relevant to the HTTP POST requests.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D) is the most relevant because it encompasses the use of web protocols for C2 communication.

### Final Answer: D
