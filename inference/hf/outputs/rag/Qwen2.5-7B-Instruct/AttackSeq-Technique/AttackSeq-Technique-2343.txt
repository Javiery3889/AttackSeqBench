Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Executing a VBA macro using `mshta.exe`.
2. Downloading a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL.
3. Ensuring continuous execution of malicious code every two hours.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
  - This technique involves altering data to achieve a malicious purpose. It does not directly relate to ensuring continuous execution of code.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It does not fit the context of ensuring continuous execution of code.

- **C: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
  - This technique involves using a Terminal Services DLL to execute code. It does not directly relate to ensuring continuous execution of code.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a specific time. This aligns well with the requirement to ensure continuous execution of malicious code every two hours.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where a dropper VBScript is downloaded and needs to be executed continuously every two hours.
- The related TTPs mention the execution tactic and the use of Visual Basic, which is consistent with the VBA macro and dropper VBScript.
- Among the given answer choices, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job (D) is the most relevant technique for ensuring continuous execution of code at a specific interval.

### Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
