Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to obfuscate and execute publicly available exploits.
2. This is followed by running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which aligns with the use of known browser vulnerabilities.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell, which aligns with the obfuscated PowerShell script mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**: This technique is about hiding command history, which is not directly related to the initial exploitation or the execution of the PowerShell script.
- **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website, which could be a way to exploit browser vulnerabilities. However, it does not directly align with the use of known browser vulnerabilities and the subsequent execution of PowerShell.
- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which is not directly related to the initial exploitation or the execution of the PowerShell script.
- **D: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to run code on the client system, which aligns with the use of known browser vulnerabilities to execute exploits and the subsequent execution of the PowerShell script.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute exploits, and then runs an obfuscated PowerShell script.
- The related TTPs mention vulnerability scanning and the use of PowerShell, which aligns with the question.
- Among the answer choices, **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** is the most relevant and directly aligns with the use of known browser vulnerabilities to execute exploits.

### Final Answer: D
