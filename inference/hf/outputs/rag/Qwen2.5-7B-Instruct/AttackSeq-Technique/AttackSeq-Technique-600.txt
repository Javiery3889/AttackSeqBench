Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Proxy tools like Ngrok are used for lateral movement.
2. Legitimate external websites are established as C2 servers.
3. Binary files are compiled from decoded snippets in the entry point.
4. Contact is established with the C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique is related to reducing the key space for encryption, which does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which could be a method to establish contact with C2 servers but does not directly address the compilation of binary files from decoded snippets.

- **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it could be part of the process of decoding snippets, it does not directly address the compilation of binary files.

- **D: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
  - This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain access or maintain persistence. It does not directly address the compilation of binary files from decoded snippets.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Proxy Tools and External Websites**: The use of proxy tools like Ngrok and establishing legitimate external websites as C2 servers aligns with T1090 and T1090.002.
2. **Decoding and Compiling Binary Files**: The process of compiling binary files from decoded snippets suggests a need for a technique that involves processing and executing code, which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs.
3. **Establishing Contact with C2 Servers**: The final step of establishing contact with the C2 servers aligns with the T1090 and T1090.002 techniques.

Given the context and the need to compile binary files from decoded snippets, none of the provided answer choices directly address this specific step. However, the closest alignment is with the techniques that involve establishing a C2 channel, which is T1090 and T1090.002.

### Final Answer: 
Since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point and establish contact with the C2 servers, and none of the provided choices directly address the compilation of binary files, the most plausible answer based on the provided context is:

Final Answer: B: T1571-Non-Standard Port
