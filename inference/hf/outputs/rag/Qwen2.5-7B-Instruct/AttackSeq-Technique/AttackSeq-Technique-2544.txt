Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A backdoor (Milestone) is used to create an administrator user for privilege escalation.
2. The next step involves evading detection by hiding malicious artifacts such as files and processes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1562.006-Indicator Blocking
- T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories
- T1564-Hide Artifacts

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear legitimate. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not specifically mention hiding files and processes.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**
  - This technique directly involves hiding files and directories, which aligns with the question's requirement to hide malicious artifacts.

- **Answer Choice C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**
  - This technique involves using malicious images, which is not directly related to hiding files and processes.

- **Answer Choice D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves obtaining system capabilities, which is not directly related to hiding files and processes.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the need to hide malicious artifacts such as files and processes to evade detection.
- Among the related TTPs, T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories is the most relevant as it directly addresses hiding files and directories.
- Answer Choice B (T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: B
