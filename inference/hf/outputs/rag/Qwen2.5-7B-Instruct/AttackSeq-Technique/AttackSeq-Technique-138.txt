Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. APT-TOCS relied on lateral movement within the internal network.
2. The next step was to communicate with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement**: Techniques like T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
- **Command and Control**: Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically follows lateral movement and precedes the use of HTTP GET requests for command and control.

- **A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**
  - This technique is about disabling or modifying firewalls, which is not directly related to the sequence of moving laterally and then using HTTP GET requests.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which could be part of the initial compromise but does not directly follow lateral movement and precede HTTP GET requests.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which includes HTTP. However, T1071.001 specifically mentions web protocols, which aligns with the HTTP GET requests mentioned in the question.

- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels, which is a method to secure communication but does not directly follow the sequence of lateral movement and then using HTTP GET requests.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Lateral Movement**: Techniques like T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services or T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer are used to move laterally within the network.
- **Next Step**: The question asks for a technique that occurs after lateral movement and before HTTP GET requests. T1071.001-Web Protocols is the most relevant as it directly involves the use of web protocols (HTTP GET requests).

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
