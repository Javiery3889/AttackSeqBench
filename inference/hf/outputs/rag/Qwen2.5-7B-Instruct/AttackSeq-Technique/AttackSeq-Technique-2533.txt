### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving initial delivery via password-protected Office documents and the execution of LURK malware to establish communication with a C2 server.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred for maintaining system persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves the use of malicious files, which aligns with the initial delivery via password-protected Office documents.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** - This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which aligns with the establishment of communication with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring the malware runs automatically at system boot or logon, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This technique involves using domain accounts for lateral movement or privilege escalation, which does not directly relate to maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique directly relates to ensuring the malware runs automatically at system boot or logon, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This is the same as B, so it is redundant.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which does not directly relate to maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for maintaining system persistence is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: B
