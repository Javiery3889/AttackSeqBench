Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that BRONZE PRESIDENT used Wmiexec for lateral movement and then performed account discovery using tools like `net user`. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred after leveraging Wmiexec for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows administrative shares for lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about system owners and users.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Wmiexec for Lateral Movement**: Wmiexec is a tool that can be used for lateral movement by executing commands on remote systems via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).
- **Account Discovery**: The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT used tools like `net user` for account discovery after performing lateral movement.

Given the sequence of actions:
1. Lateral movement using Wmiexec.
2. Account discovery using `net user`.

We need to find the ATT&CK technique that best fits the step after lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Wmiexec (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares)**: This is the technique used for lateral movement.
- **Account Discovery (T1087)**: This is the technique used for gathering information about network environments, which aligns with the use of `net user` for account discovery.

The related TTPs do not directly mention account discovery, but the context of the question and the techniques provided strongly suggest that the next step after lateral movement would be to gather information about the network environment, which is best described by T1087.

### Final Answer: C: T1087-Account Discovery
