### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where A41APT maintained persistence by registering scheduled tasks that ran legitimate executables every 15 minutes to load DESLoader.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this persistence technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention T1053.005-Scheduled Task, which aligns with the persistence technique described in the question.
   - The TTPs are categorized under Tactic: Persistence and Tactic: Execution, both of which are relevant to the scenario.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. It does not directly follow the persistence technique described.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to execute code. While it can be used for execution, it does not directly follow the persistence technique.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to execute code. It is more about remote execution rather than the immediate next step after persistence.
   - **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It is not directly related to the persistence and execution techniques described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve techniques that directly follow the persistence and execution of the malware.
   - The technique that best fits this sequence is T1106-Native API, as it involves using native APIs to execute code, which is a common next step after persistence and execution.

### Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API
