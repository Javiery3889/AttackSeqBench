### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents to gain initial access.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry before the spear-phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment," which aligns with the context of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves searching for credentials in files, which is not directly related to preparing and targeting specific individuals through spear-phishing.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the target, which is highly relevant to preparing and targeting specific individuals. It aligns well with the need to understand the defense industry targets before sending spear-phishing emails.
   - **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
     - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets, which is more about identifying a broader range of potential victims rather than specifically targeting individuals.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools, which is not directly related to the preparation and targeting phase of the spear-phishing attack.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the gathering of victim identity information to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry.

**Final Answer: B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
