Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where MuddyWater uses CVE-2017-0199 through decoy documents for initial access. After gaining initial access, the attackers initiate communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code used in the second stage of attacks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web page or other publicly accessible resource.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel, which is more about maintaining communication rather than initiating it.
- **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to the communication with compromised servers.
- **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or malware to the target system, which is more about the initial transfer rather than the communication.
- **Answer Choice D: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**
  - This technique involves dealing with data transfer size limitations, which is not directly related to the communication with compromised servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code, which aligns with the concept of command and control.
- The related TTPs mention T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which is directly related to maintaining communication and transferring data.
- T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is the most relevant technique as it involves using multiple channels for command and control, which fits the scenario of initiating communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code.

### Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

However, upon re-evaluation, the most fitting answer based on the context of the question and the related TTPs is:

### Final Answer: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
