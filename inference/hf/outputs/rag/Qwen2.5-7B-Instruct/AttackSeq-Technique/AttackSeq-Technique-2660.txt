### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Mustang Panda's Korplug variant retrieves system information such as uptime, Windows version, and system locale.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurs during the stage where data is collected from the local system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging
     - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves the attacker staging data locally before exfiltrating it. While it is related to data collection, it is more about the staging process rather than the collection itself.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique directly involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the question's description of retrieving system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is part of the initial reconnaissance phase. While it is relevant, it is more about the discovery phase rather than the collection phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the question's focus on the stage where data is collected from the local system, the most plausible answer is T1005-Data from Local System.

### Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System
