### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a backdoor (Pierogi) communicates with predefined URLs to receive commands and send machine information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves the adversary using web protocols for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target's systems.
   - **Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the adversary using automated methods to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves the adversary using a sequence of connection attempts to a target to establish a connection. It is not directly related to the communication with predefined URLs.
   - **Option B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the adversary using a web service to establish a connection. While it is related to web protocols, it does not directly follow the communication with predefined URLs.
   - **Option C: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves the adversary taking actions to prevent detection or analysis of their activities. It is not directly related to the communication with predefined URLs.
   - **Option D: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**: This technique involves the adversary using process injection to spoof the parent process ID. It is not directly related to the communication with predefined URLs.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After the backdoor communicates with predefined URLs to receive commands and send machine information, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the data collected from the machine.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** (related to the tactic of Exfiltration) is the most plausible technique that would follow the communication with predefined URLs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D (T1020-Automated Exfiltration)
