Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. Tropic Trooper gained initial access via exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
2. The execution of the backdoor's installer is triggered by users' actions or interactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique is about using encrypted channels to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It does not align with the scenario of leveraging user actions to trigger the deployment of a backdoor.

- **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves using resource forks in files to hide malicious code. It is not directly related to the scenario of triggering the backdoor's deployment through user actions.

- **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**
  - This technique involves executing code without a traditional server-client model, which is not directly related to the scenario of user interaction triggering the backdoor's deployment.

- **D: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves executing code or content that requires user interaction to be triggered. This aligns well with the scenario where the backdoor's installer is deployed based on users' actions or interactions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the backdoor's installer is triggered by user actions or interactions.
- The related TTPs mention T1204.002-Malicious File, which is a sub-technique of T1204-User Execution.
- T1204-User Execution directly aligns with the scenario of the backdoor's installer being triggered by user actions.

### Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
