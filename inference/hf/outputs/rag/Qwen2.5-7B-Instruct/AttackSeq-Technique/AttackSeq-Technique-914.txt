Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The RAT controller used encrypted network communication with compromised hosts.
2. The FAKEM RAT controller issued commands to execute shell commands, browse directories, and access running processes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using a command shell to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for command and control communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP most likely occurred before the FAKEM RAT controller issued commands to execute shell commands, browse directories, and access running processes.

- **Option A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**: This technique is about disabling or modifying the system firewall, which is not directly related to the encrypted communication or the execution of commands.
- **Option B: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography, which is not directly related to the encrypted communication described in the question.
- **Option C: T1600-Weaken Encryption**: This technique involves weakening encryption, which is not directly related to the encrypted communication described in the question.
- **Option D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the encrypted network communication mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions encrypted network communication, which aligns with the use of application layer protocols (T1071).
- The related TTPs include techniques for command and control (T1573.001) and execution (T1059.003), which are relevant to the actions described in the question.
- The sequence of TTPs should logically start with the method of communication (encrypted network communication) before the specific actions (executing commands, browsing directories, and accessing processes).

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
