To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated APT15's remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor. The RoyalDNS backdoor is used for persistent communication over DNS, which falls under the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.004-DNS

This indicates that the technique involves using DNS for command and control purposes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a system. While it can be part of an initial compromise, it does not directly facilitate remote access or command and control over DNS.
  
- **B: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a system. This could be relevant for establishing remote access, but it does not specifically mention DNS or command and control.

- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a system. Similar to T1078.003, it is about gaining access but not specifically about remote access or DNS command and control.

- **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to a system. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the use of DNS for command and control.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the related TTPs, the technique T1071.004-DNS is directly related to using DNS for command and control. However, the question asks for the technique that facilitated remote access before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor. The most plausible technique that aligns with this requirement is one that provides initial access and remote control, which is not directly DNS but rather a method to establish a foothold.

Among the given choices, **T1133-External Remote Services (B)** is the most plausible because it involves using external services to gain remote access, which can then be used to establish the DNS-based command and control channel.

### Final Answer: B
