### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker first uses the 'bs.dll' plugin for gathering system information under the Discovery tactic.
   - The next step is to execute malicious plugins like 'dstr.dll' and 'grc.dll' on Windows systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention 'DLL Side-Loading' under the Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion tactics.
   - 'DLL Side-Loading' is a technique where an attacker tricks the system into loading a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandboxing environments. It does not directly relate to loading malicious DLLs.
   - **B: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation** - This technique involves using WMI to execute commands or scripts. While it can be used for execution, it is not specifically about loading malicious DLLs.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code. 'DLL Side-Loading' is a specific form of this technique where a malicious DLL is loaded instead of a legitimate one.
   - **D: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery** - This technique is about discovering and using cloud infrastructure. It does not directly relate to loading malicious DLLs on Windows systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1129-Shared Modules** because it directly relates to the technique of loading malicious DLLs, which is a form of 'DLL Side-Loading'.

**Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules**
