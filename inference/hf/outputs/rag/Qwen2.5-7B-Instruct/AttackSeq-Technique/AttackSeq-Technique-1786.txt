Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Privilege escalation using Mimikatz for credential dumping has occurred.
2. The attackers need to bypass application whitelisting and security software to maintain stealth.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique is directly related to the initial privilege escalation step.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique is relevant to the overall goal of bypassing security measures.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique is repeated, indicating its importance in the context of maintaining stealth.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided context:

- **A: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**: This technique is related to privilege escalation and might be used in a Linux environment, but it does not directly address bypassing application whitelisting and security software.
- **B: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves discovering accounts and their permissions, which is not directly related to bypassing application whitelisting and security software.
- **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to run malicious code. It can be used to bypass security software and application whitelisting by making the malicious code appear as legitimate.
- **D: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. It is not directly related to bypassing application whitelisting and security software.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on maintaining stealth and avoiding detection after privilege escalation.
- The related TTPs mention bypassing User Account Control and exploiting for defense evasion.
- Among the answer choices, **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** (C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need to bypass security software and application whitelisting by modifying the execution flow of processes.

### Final Answer: C
