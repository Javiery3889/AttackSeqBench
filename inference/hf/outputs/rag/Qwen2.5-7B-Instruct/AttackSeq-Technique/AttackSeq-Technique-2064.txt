Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compromising domain administrator passwords.
2. Controlling all active domain accounts.
3. Using Metasploit for port scanning.
4. Escalating privileges.
5. Gaining access to other systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to escalate privileges.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync**: This technique involves using DCSync to exfiltrate domain credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services for command and control or data exfiltration. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to escalate privileges. However, the question specifically mentions domain accounts, not local accounts.
- **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to systems. It is more aligned with the initial compromise and port scanning described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes compromising domain administrator passwords and controlling all active domain accounts.
2. The related TTPs mention DCSync (T1003.006) for exfiltrating domain credentials and Domain Accounts (T1078.002) for privilege escalation.
3. The sequence of actions (compromising domain accounts, controlling them, and then using Metasploit for port scanning and privilege escalation) suggests that the initial compromise and control of domain accounts must have occurred before the subsequent actions.
4. Exploitation of remote services (T1210) is more likely to be the technique that occurred before the attackers used Metasploit for port scanning and privilege escalation.

### Final Answer: D
