Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT33 conducted reconnaissance on relevant networks using private VPN exit nodes and then issued commands to bots through their private VPN network. We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the reconnaissance phase but precedes the command issuance phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided TTPs:

- **A: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**
  - This technique involves making remote procedure calls, which is more about the command and control (C2) phase rather than the reconnaissance phase.
  
- **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase. However, it is more about identifying targets rather than using a private network.
  
- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which is more about avoiding detection rather than the reconnaissance phase.
  
- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain access, which is more about the initial access phase rather than the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: APT33 conducted reconnaissance on relevant networks using private VPN exit nodes. This is a clear indication of the initial phase of the attack.
2. **Next Phase**: The next phase should logically be a technique that involves establishing a foothold or gaining access to the network, which is typically done through initial access techniques.
3. **Private Network Usage**: The use of a private network to issue commands to bots suggests a persistence technique, but the question asks for the technique that occurs after reconnaissance and before command issuance.

Given the context, the most plausible TTP that fits the sequence is one that involves establishing a foothold or gaining access to the network, which is best described by **T1133-External Remote Services**.

### Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery
