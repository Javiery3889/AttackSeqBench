### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT28 uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique in Office products from a malicious document to fetch and execute a payload via PowerShell for initial access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial use of DDE and PowerShell.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic "Execution" and the Techniques "T1059.001-PowerShell" and "T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange."
   - This indicates that the sequence involves the execution of PowerShell and the use of DDE.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While PowerShell is a scripting interpreter, this technique is more general and does not specifically follow the use of DDE.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. It does not directly follow the use of DDE and PowerShell for initial access.
   - **C: T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) or trust provider to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the use of DDE and PowerShell.
   - **D: T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM)**
     - This technique involves using the Component Object Model to execute code. DDE often uses COM to communicate between applications, and PowerShell can leverage COM objects to execute code. This technique is closely related to the use of DDE and PowerShell.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after APT28 used DDE and PowerShell for initial access, they would likely use the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: D**
