Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Elderwood Project attackers used zero-day exploits delivered through spear phishing or Web injections during watering hole attacks to gain initial access to their targets. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a publicly accessible web resource to deliver malicious content to victims. It is often used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via email or other means to trick the victim into clicking on it, which can lead to the execution of malware or the compromise of the system.

Given that the initial access was achieved through zero-day exploits delivered via spear phishing or Web injections, the next step would likely involve exploiting the initial foothold to gain further access or escalate privileges.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices
- **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through a third party. It is not directly related to exploiting the initial access.
- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. Given that the initial access was through zero-day exploits, this technique is highly relevant.
- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This is the same as B, so it is also relevant.
- **D: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves creating a task or service to run malicious code. While it can be used post-exploitation, it is not the most direct follow-up to the initial access.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through zero-day exploits delivered via spear phishing or Web injections is to exploit vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications.

Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
