### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where LURK malware connects to a command-and-control server and uses a backup domain for communication after gaining initial access via socially engineered emails.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access via socially engineered emails.
     - Connection to a command-and-control server.
     - Use of a backup domain for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
   - **Command and Control:**
     - T1008-Fallback Channels

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1561-Disk Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping data from a disk, which is not directly related to the initial access or command and control activities described.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into a web page, which is not directly related to the initial access or command and control activities described.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves executing malware when the system boots or a user logs on. While it is a TTP, it does not directly relate to the initial access via socially engineered emails or the command and control activities.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. The related TTPs (T1566.003 and T1566.002) specifically mention spearphishing, which aligns with the socially engineered emails mentioned in the question.
     - After gaining initial access, the malware connects to a command-and-control server and uses a backup domain for communication, which aligns with the T1008-Fallback Channels technique.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
