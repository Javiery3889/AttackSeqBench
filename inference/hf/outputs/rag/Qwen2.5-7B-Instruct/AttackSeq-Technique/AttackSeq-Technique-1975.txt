### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs where attackers first gather specific details about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase before gaining Initial Access via phishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the target, which aligns with the question's requirement of gathering specific details about potential victims.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This is a specific method of phishing, which also aligns with the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1137.001-Office Template Macros**
     - This technique involves using macros in Office documents, which is not directly related to gathering victim information during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for specific words or phrases, which is not directly related to gathering victim information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique directly involves collecting information about the target, which is the specific detail gathering required by the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is not related to the Reconnaissance phase or gathering victim information.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers first gathered specific details about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase using the technique T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information.

**Final Answer: C**
