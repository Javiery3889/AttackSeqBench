### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of techniques used to deploy ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts after bypassing security controls with HTML Smuggling.
   - The goal is to ensure that malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW (Mark of the Web).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique is used to bypass security controls by injecting malicious content into web pages.
   - **T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass:** This technique is specifically aimed at ensuring that malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW, which is a security measure to identify and block malicious content.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious content to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique is about using digital certificates to establish trust. It does not directly relate to bypassing MOTW or ensuring payloads are not tagged.
   - **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:** This technique involves compromising systems to gain access or control. It does not directly address the issue of bypassing MOTW.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls, which could be relevant to bypassing MOTW, but it is more general and does not specifically mention bypassing MOTW.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves splitting a file into multiple parts to evade detection. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly address the issue of bypassing MOTW.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the goal of ensuring malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW, after using HTML Smuggling, is **T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**.

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** (Note: The correct answer choice should be T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass, but since it is not listed, the closest relevant technique is C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls).
