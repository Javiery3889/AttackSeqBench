### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Trojan (Trojan.APT.Seinup) uses Google Docs to evade callback detection through redirection and encrypted communications via SSL.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**, **Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves the attacker impersonating a legitimate protocol or service to establish a C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves the attacker disguising malicious activity to make it appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**: This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel, which does not align well with the scenario of using Google Docs for redirection and encrypted communications.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection, which could be part of the overall strategy but does not directly follow the use of Google Docs and SSL.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for C2, which could be a plausible next step after using Google Docs and SSL for communication.
   - **D: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malicious activity, which could be a plausible next step after establishing a communication channel using Google Docs and SSL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of using Google Docs and SSL for communication, the most plausible next step would be to disguise the malicious activity to make it appear legitimate. This aligns well with the T1036-Masquerading technique.
   - Additionally, the T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation technique from the related TTPs also supports the idea of disguising the C2 channel.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading
