Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. SSL/TLS-encrypted HTTPS communications are used for C2.
2. The malware uses multi-layered obfuscation methods, including XOR encoding, to mask its C2 traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for C2 communications.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encoding or encrypting files to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating data to make it harder to understand or analyze.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring the malware starts automatically when the system boots or when a user logs on. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation or encryption of C2 traffic.
- **B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation or encryption of C2 traffic.
- **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating data to make it harder to understand or analyze. Given that the malware uses multi-layered obfuscation methods, including XOR encoding, this technique aligns well with the described obfuscation methods.
- **D: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves using a sequence of connections to a port to establish a connection. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation or encryption of C2 traffic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of SSL/TLS-encrypted HTTPS communications for C2, which aligns with T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography.
- The malware uses multi-layered obfuscation methods, including XOR encoding, to mask its C2 traffic. This aligns with T1001-Data Obfuscation.
- The related TTPs mention T1001-Data Obfuscation, which directly supports the use of obfuscation techniques like XOR encoding.

### Final Answer: C: T1001-Data Obfuscation
