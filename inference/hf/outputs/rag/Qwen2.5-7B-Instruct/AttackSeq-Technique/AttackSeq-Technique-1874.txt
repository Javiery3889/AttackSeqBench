Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services (like Pastebin or Google+) to communicate with its C2 servers. This indicates that the malware is employing a technique to mask its communication channels to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves the use of web services for bidirectional communication between the malware and the C2 server.
  - **Technique: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the use of web services for communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
  - This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the communication method described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information, which is also not directly related to the communication method described.
- **Answer Choice C: T1001.002-Steganography**
  - This technique involves hiding data within other data, which is not directly related to the communication method described.
- **Answer Choice D: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves the use of web services for communication, which aligns with the use of legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware using legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) to communicate with its C2 servers.
- The related TTPs mention the use of web services for C2 communication.
- Among the answer choices, T1102-Web Service (D) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the described communication method.

### Final Answer: D
