Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where spear phishing lures with malicious RTF documents are used to infect a user with QuasarRAT. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the execution of QuasarRAT.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the execution of QuasarRAT.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a spear phishing attachment to deliver malware, which matches the description of the malicious RTF documents used in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious file. While it could be a method to execute malware, it is not directly related to the initial delivery of the malware via spear phishing.
- **Answer Choice B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the behavior of a legitimate program by injecting code into it. It is not directly related to the initial delivery of the malware.
- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. However, the specific technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is more precise and aligns with the use of malicious RTF documents.
- **Answer Choice D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to deliver malware. It is not directly related to the initial delivery of the malware via spear phishing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of spear phishing lures with malicious RTF documents, which aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
- The execution of QuasarRAT is a subsequent step, which aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique.
- The T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique is the most direct and relevant to the initial delivery of the malware, which is a prerequisite for the execution of QuasarRAT.

### Final Answer: C
