Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks.
2. The backdoor was downloaded.
3. A PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection was used to inject the final payload DLL into memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with the use of Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process, which aligns with the injection of the final payload DLL.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which also aligns with the injection of the final payload DLL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique is not directly related to the injection of a payload into memory or the use of scheduled tasks.
- **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to the injection of a payload into memory or the use of scheduled tasks.
- **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute code, which aligns with the first part of the sequence (payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks).
- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules, which is not directly related to the injection of a payload into memory or the use of scheduled tasks.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where scheduled tasks are used to execute payload stagers, which download the backdoor, and then a PowerShell loader is used to inject the final payload DLL into memory.
- The related TTPs mention techniques like T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection and T1055-Process Injection, which align with the injection of the final payload DLL.
- The most relevant TTP for the initial step (using scheduled tasks) is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

### Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
