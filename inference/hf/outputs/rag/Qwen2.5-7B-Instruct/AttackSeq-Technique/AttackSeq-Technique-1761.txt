Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of multiple variants of a custom VBS backdoor.
2. Execution of VBS scripts for potential data collection.
3. Establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is relevant as it involves establishing communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols to establish command and control (C2) communication.
- **Tactic: Execution**: This is relevant as it involves the execution of scripts.
- **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for script execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish C2 communication. Given that the question mentions establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers, this technique aligns well with the need to use a protocol to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

- **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. While this could be a method to establish communication, it is not as directly related to the use of web protocols as T1071.001.

- **C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
  - This technique involves using container orchestration to execute tasks. This is not directly related to establishing C2 communication with a server.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute tasks. While this could be part of the overall attack sequence, it does not directly address the establishment of C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is directly related to using web protocols for C2 communication.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (A) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the need to use a protocol to establish communication with the attacker's infrastructure.

### Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
