### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to the Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
   - The key elements are "initial access" and "spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - This confirms that the attack sequence involves the use of spear phishing emails to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities** - This technique involves developing or enhancing the attacker's capabilities. It is not directly related to the initial access or the spear phishing attack.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique involves the use of external remote services to gain access. While it can be part of an attack, it is not specifically related to the spear phishing attack mentioned.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the target's systems. It is a step that might occur after initial access but not before.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to deliver malicious content. Specifically, "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment" involves delivering a malicious attachment via a spear phishing email. This aligns perfectly with the question's description of the spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
