### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the execution of `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Execution" and the technique of "T1059.003-Windows Command Shell," which aligns with the use of `cmd.exe` in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email. Given that the question mentions `cmd.exe` being used to download and install a backdoor, this technique seems less likely as it does not directly follow the execution of a command shell.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the execution of `cmd.exe` for downloading and installing a backdoor.
   - **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
     - This technique involves modifying access tokens to gain elevated privileges. After downloading and installing a backdoor, an attacker might need to manipulate access tokens to maintain persistence or escalate privileges, making this a plausible next step.
   - **D: T1597-Search Closed Sources**
     - This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the execution of `cmd.exe` for downloading and installing a backdoor.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the execution of `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor is **T1134-Access Token Manipulation**.

Final Answer: C
