Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Shellbot circumvented detection by assigning hardcoded process names.
2. The IRC channel was maintained with PING/PONG communication to evade monitoring.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**: This technique involves using time-based evasion to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves hiding malicious activity by making it appear as legitimate activity.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email addresses from local systems. It does not align with the described TTPs of process name hardcoding and PING/PONG communication.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique aligns with the use of IRC (Internet Relay Chat) for command and control, which is mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding malicious artifacts, which is not directly related to the described TTPs.
- **D: T1542.001-System Firmware**: This technique involves modifying system firmware, which is not relevant to the described TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Shellbot uses hardcoded process names and maintains an IRC channel with PING/PONG communication.
- The related TTPs mention the use of application layer protocols (T1071) for command and control, which aligns with the IRC channel.
- The other TTPs do not directly relate to the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
