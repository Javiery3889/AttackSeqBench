### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server to send information about current sessions.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure data exfiltration over the same communication channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Exfiltration" and specifically the technique "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel."
   - This indicates that the technique used for data exfiltration should be over the same communication channel that was established for the initial communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1040-Network Sniffing** - This technique involves intercepting and analyzing network traffic. While it can be used to exfiltrate data, it does not necessarily ensure that the data is exfiltrated over the same communication channel used for initial communication.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the target system. It does not pertain to exfiltration and is not relevant to the question.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** - This technique directly aligns with the question as it involves exfiltrating data over the same communication channel used for initial communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook** - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook, which is a different method and not necessarily over the same communication channel as the initial C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures data exfiltration over the same communication channel is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

Final Answer: C
