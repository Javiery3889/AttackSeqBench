### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group during an attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Discovery activities (network share and process discovery).
     - An action that occurs after these discovery activities.
     - The use of compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - T1046-Network Service Discovery
     - T1083-File and Directory Discovery
   - These techniques are part of the Discovery tactic, which aligns with the initial discovery activities mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
     - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to establish a remote management session. While it can be used for lateral movement, it does not directly relate to overcoming network segmentation.
   - **B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to facilitate lateral movement. It is more about moving laterally within the network rather than overcoming network segmentation.
   - **C: T1587.004-Exploits**
     - This technique involves using exploits to gain access to systems. It is a method to gain initial access or escalate privileges, but it does not directly relate to overcoming network segmentation.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. It is more about evading detection rather than overcoming network segmentation.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifies that the action occurs after discovery activities and before using compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer (B)** is the most plausible choice because it involves transferring tools, which can be used to facilitate the use of compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation. This action logically follows the discovery activities and precedes the use of compromised router virtual machines.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
