Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attacker evades detection and maintains a foothold on infected machines.
2. The attacker exploits CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions.
3. The attacker uses Google Drive for its operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Resource Development** - This suggests the attacker is developing or using resources for their operations.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This indicates the attacker is trying to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This suggests the attacker is gaining initial access to the target environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided context:

- **A: T1491.001-Internal Defacement** - This technique involves defacing internal websites, which does not align with the use of Google Drive for operations.
- **B: T1132.001-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection, which could be part of the evasion strategy but does not directly relate to using Google Drive.
- **C: T1176-Browser Extensions** - This technique involves using browser extensions to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the use of Google Drive.
- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. Given that the attacker is using Google Drive, this technique could be relevant as Google Drive uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the use of Google Drive, which implies the attacker is using a web service for data exfiltration or persistence.
- The related TTPs mention "Web Services" (T1583.006) and "Defense Evasion" (T1211), which align with the use of Google Drive.
- Among the given choices, T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is the most relevant as it directly relates to using web protocols, which Google Drive uses.

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
