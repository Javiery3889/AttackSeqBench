Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tildeb uses encrypted communication with a modified SHA-1 hashing algorithm to establish session keys. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Command and Control (C2) phase to deploy additional tools for malicious activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing or decoding obfuscation to access or use files or information.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access to systems. It does not directly relate to deploying additional tools for malicious activities via C2 channels.
- **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It is a plausible candidate as it directly relates to deploying additional tools, which could be part of the C2 phase.
- **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to deploying additional tools for malicious activities.
- **D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for C2 communication. It is related to C2 but does not directly address the deployment of additional tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for a technique that occurred before the C2 phase to deploy additional tools.
- T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (B) is the most direct and relevant technique for deploying additional tools into the target environment, which can then be used in the C2 phase.
- The other techniques (T1078.002, T1070, and T1104) are either not directly related to deploying tools or are more related to the C2 phase itself.

### Final Answer: B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
