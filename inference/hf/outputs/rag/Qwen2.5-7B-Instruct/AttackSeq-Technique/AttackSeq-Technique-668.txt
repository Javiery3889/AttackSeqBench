### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions a multi-stage infection framework used by the CopyKittens attack group.
   - It specifically mentions the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution to prevent detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves the use of native APIs, which aligns with the runtime API address resolution mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** - This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which is a common multi-stage infection strategy.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution** - This technique involves dynamically resolving API addresses at runtime, which is directly related to the runtime API address resolution mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1070.007-Clear Network Connection History and Configurations** - This technique is about clearing network connection history and configurations, which does not directly align with the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation** - While data obfuscation can be a part of a multi-stage infection framework, it is not directly related to the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution.
   - **C: T1547.012-Print Processors** - This technique involves using print processors, which is not directly related to the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution.
   - **D: T1622-Debugger Evasion** - This technique involves evading debuggers, which can be a part of a multi-stage infection framework but is not directly related to the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is the use of dynamic API resolution (T1027.007) as part of the multi-stage infection framework.
   - After dynamic API resolution, the next logical step would be to ensure that the malware is not detected by other means, such as evading debuggers (T1622).

**Final Answer: D: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
