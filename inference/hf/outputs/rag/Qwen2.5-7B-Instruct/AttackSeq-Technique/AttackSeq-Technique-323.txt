Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a backdoor has established an active connection with C2 servers and enables the remote installation of new apps or code. The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates the threat actors' ability to evade detection and maintain a legitimate appearance during operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves using legitimate names or locations to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves using legitimate or registered domains to support the operation.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making malicious activity appear legitimate to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique is about intercepting multi-factor authentication tokens, which is not directly related to evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.
- **Answer Choice B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which is more about gaining initial access rather than evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.
- **Answer Choice C: T1584.002-DNS Server**: This technique involves controlling DNS servers, which is more about redirecting traffic or altering DNS records, not directly about evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.
- **Answer Choice D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary, which is more about obfuscating the command execution rather than evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique directly aligns with the need to make the activity appear legitimate to evade detection.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique also aligns with the need to make the activity appear legitimate to evade detection.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that facilitates the threat actors' ability to evade detection and maintain a legitimate appearance is **T1036-Masquerading**.

### Final Answer: D
