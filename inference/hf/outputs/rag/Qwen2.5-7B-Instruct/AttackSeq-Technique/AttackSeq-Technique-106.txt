### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Waterbear malware uses API hooking to evade detection and then connects to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - **API Hooking (T1106-Native API)**: This is used to evade detection by modifying functions in memory.
     - **Connecting to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files**: This suggests a technique for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This confirms the use of API hooking.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This is about hiding or blocking indicators of the malware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This involves embedding payloads within legitimate files or processes to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. While it can be used for lateral movement, it does not directly relate to receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.
   - **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or update software. It does not directly relate to receiving payloads or files from external entities.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or data from an external entity to the target environment. This directly aligns with the scenario of connecting to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it is related to evasion, it does not directly address the act of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the scenario of connecting to external entities to receive additional payloads or files is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
