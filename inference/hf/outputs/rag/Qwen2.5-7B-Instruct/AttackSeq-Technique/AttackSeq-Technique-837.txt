Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where data is processed and encrypted with AES before exfiltration, and the communication with the C2 server uses either UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556. The key points are:
- Data is encrypted with AES.
- Communication is over non-standard ports (6999 and 55556).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for data exfiltration.
- **Non-Application Layer Protocol (T1095)**: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for command and control (C2) communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This TTP involves using non-standard ports for communication, which aligns with the use of UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
  - However, it does not directly address the encryption aspect of the data.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This TTP involves using encrypted channels for communication, which aligns with the encryption of data with AES.
  - However, it does not directly address the use of non-standard ports.

- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This TTP involves discovering software on the target system, which is not directly related to the communication method or encryption technique described.

- **D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
  - This TTP involves using digital certificates for authentication, which is not directly related to the communication method or encryption technique described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where data is encrypted and exfiltrated over non-standard ports.
- The related TTPs mention using non-standard protocols for C2 communication.
- Among the answer choices, **T1571-Non-Standard Port** (A) directly addresses the use of non-standard ports, which is a key aspect of the question.

### Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port
