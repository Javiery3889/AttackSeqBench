### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT42 to avoid detection, including obfuscating files, process injection, and hidden windows.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**:
     - This technique involves creating a process that mimics another process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**:
     - This technique involves obfuscating files to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**:
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from tools, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described (obfuscation, process injection, hidden windows).
   - **Answer Choice B: T1078.003-Local Accounts**:
     - This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**:
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain access to systems, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**:
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts of malicious activity to avoid detection. Given the context of obfuscation, process injection, and hidden windows, this technique aligns well with the goal of evading detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
