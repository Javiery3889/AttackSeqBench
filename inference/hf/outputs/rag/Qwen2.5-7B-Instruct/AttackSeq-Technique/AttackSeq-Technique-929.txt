### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Volatile Cedar first exploits server vulnerabilities to inject web shell code.
   - We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before the group used compromised web servers for gaining initial access to internal networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary's first step to establish a foothold in the target network.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique T1190):** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary's actions to maintain access to the target network.
   - **Web Shell (Technique T1505.003):** This technique involves using a web shell to maintain access to the target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It does not align with the sequence of events described, as it does not involve exploiting a public-facing application or gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks to identify potential targets. While it could be a step in the initial access process, it does not directly align with exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves gathering data from information repositories. It does not align with the sequence of events described, as it does not involve exploiting a public-facing application or gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning:** This technique involves using a wordlist to scan for credentials or other information. It could be a step in the initial access process, as it involves scanning for potential vulnerabilities or credentials that could be used to gain access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of exploiting server vulnerabilities to inject web shell code, is that the group first used a technique to scan for potential vulnerabilities or credentials. This aligns with the use of a wordlist to scan for information that could be used to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning.

**Final Answer: D**
