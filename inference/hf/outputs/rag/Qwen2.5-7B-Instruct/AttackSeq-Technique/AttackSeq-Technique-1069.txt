Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting and exfiltrating system information and screenshots.
2. Exfiltrating the data to an attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
3. Using HTTP on port 443 for communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining access to the target system.
- **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target system.
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves using a web service for exfiltration.
  - It aligns with the use of HTTP on port 443, which is a web service.
  - It fits the context of exfiltrating data to a server.

- **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using a web service.
  - It aligns with the use of HTTP on port 443, which is a web service.
  - However, it does not specifically mention exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - This technique involves tunneling one protocol over another.
  - It does not directly align with the use of HTTP on port 443 for exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves executing malware at boot or logon.
  - It does not align with the exfiltration process described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of HTTP on port 443 for exfiltration, which aligns with the use of a web service for data exfiltration.
- T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service (Answer Choice A) is the most specific and relevant technique for exfiltrating data over a web service using HTTP on port 443.
- T1102-Web Service (Answer Choice B) is also relevant but does not specifically mention exfiltration.
- T1572-Protocol Tunneling (Answer Choice C) and T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Answer Choice D) do not align with the exfiltration process described.

### Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
