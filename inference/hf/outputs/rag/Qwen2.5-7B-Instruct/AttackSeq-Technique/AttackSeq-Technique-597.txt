Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Adversaries used obfuscated files or information (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information).
2. They removed security software to avoid detection.
3. They collected credentials using tools like punk.py to gather usernames and SSH keys (T1552.004-Private Keys).

We need to identify the TTP that occurs after obfuscation and removal of security software but before credential collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys**: This is the final step in the sequence, where credentials are collected.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This is the first step, where files are obfuscated.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically follows obfuscation and removal of security software but precedes credential collection.

- **A: T1601.001-Patch System Image**: This technique involves patching the system image, which is not directly related to the sequence of obfuscation, removal of security software, and credential collection.
- **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which could be a method to avoid detection by hiding malicious processes. This could logically follow obfuscation and removal of security software.
- **C: T1098.003-Additional Cloud Roles**: This technique involves using additional cloud roles, which is not directly related to the sequence of obfuscation, removal of security software, and credential collection.
- **D: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing code based on an event, which could be a method to avoid detection but does not directly follow the sequence of obfuscation and removal of security software.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Obfuscation (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information)**: Adversaries use obfuscated files to avoid detection.
- **Removal of Security Software (Not a specific ATT&CK technique but a general action)**: Adversaries remove security software to avoid detection.
- **Process Injection (T1055)**: This technique could be used to hide malicious processes, which is a logical step after obfuscation and removal of security software.
- **Credential Collection (T1552.004-Private Keys)**: Adversaries use tools like punk.py to collect credentials.

Based on the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurs after obfuscation and removal of security software but before credential collection is **T1055-Process Injection**.

### Final Answer: D
