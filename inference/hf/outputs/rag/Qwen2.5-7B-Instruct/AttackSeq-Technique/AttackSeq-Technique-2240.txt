Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where social engineering and spear phishing are used for credential access. After these initial access techniques, the next step involves suspicious string obfuscation and making API calls harder to detect. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before these steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This includes techniques like T1566-Phishing, which aligns with the social engineering and spear phishing mentioned in the question.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This includes techniques like T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information, which aligns with the suspicious string obfuscation and harder-to-detect API calls.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique is about evading debugger detection, which is more related to the Defense Evasion tactic and does not directly align with the initial access or credential access steps.
- **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the initial access or credential access steps described in the question.
- **C: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves network-level attacks, which could be part of the initial access but does not directly align with the credential access or the subsequent steps of obfuscation and API call detection.
- **D: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs:** This technique involves clearing event logs to avoid detection, which is more related to the Defense Evasion tactic and does not directly align with the initial access or credential access steps.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence starting with social engineering and spear phishing for credential access.
- The next step involves suspicious string obfuscation and making API calls harder to detect, which are part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
- Among the given options, T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs (D) is the most plausible technique that could have occurred before the suspicious string obfuscation and harder-to-detect API calls, as it is a common technique used to evade detection after gaining access.

### Final Answer: D
