### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an Emissary Trojan is used to maintain persistence on a targeted system. The methods mentioned include hijacking legitimate services or adding startup code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to ensure the malware persists.
     - **Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order of DLLs to load a malicious DLL, which can also be used for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures**: This technique involves using SQL stored procedures to maintain persistence. However, the question does not mention SQL or database-related activities, making this less likely.
   - **B: T1543.002-Systemd Service**: This technique is specific to Linux systems and involves creating or modifying a systemd service. The question does not specify a Linux environment, making this less likely.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves adding a file to a location that is executed at boot or logon, such as the Windows startup folder. This aligns well with the description of adding startup code for persistence.
   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves infecting a user's system through a web page or other online resource. This does not align with the described persistence methods.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question. It aligns with the idea of adding startup code to maintain persistence.

### Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
