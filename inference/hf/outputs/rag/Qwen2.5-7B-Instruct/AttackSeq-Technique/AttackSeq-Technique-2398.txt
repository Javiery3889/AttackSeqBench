### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where TDrop2 uses process hollowing to evade detection and disguise its payload retrieval for defense evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was likely used to gather details about the infected system after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Defense Evasion."
   - The specific technique is "T1055.012-Process Hollowing," which is a method used to evade detection by hiding malicious processes within legitimate ones.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which is not directly related to gathering system details after process hollowing.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the question's requirement to gather details about the infected system.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is about evading detection in virtualized or sandboxed environments, which is not directly related to gathering system details.
   - **D: T1560.002-Archive via Library** - This technique involves archiving data using a library, which is not relevant to the context of gathering system details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of gathering details about the infected system after process hollowing, is T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
