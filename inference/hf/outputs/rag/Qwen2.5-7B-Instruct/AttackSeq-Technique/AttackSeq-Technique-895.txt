### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: ensuring the integrity of a malicious payload using a sha256 checksum, bypassing detection with encrypted shellcode, and then loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload.
   - The key techniques involved are integrity checks (sha256 checksum), encryption, and execution of a payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process to execute malicious code.
     - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decrypting or decoding files or information to reveal their true nature.
   - Both of these techniques are relevant to the described sequence of actions, as they involve loading and executing a payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves using containers to host and run malicious code. It does not directly relate to loading a DLL and executing a payload.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions. While it could be part of the execution process, it does not specifically address the loading of a DLL.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate. It does not directly relate to the loading and execution of a DLL.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the loading and execution of a DLL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** (which is related to loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload) and **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** (which is related to decrypting the payload).
   - Among the given answer choices, the closest match is **B: T1106-Native API**, as it is the closest to the execution part of the sequence, although it does not directly cover the DLL loading aspect.

**Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API**
