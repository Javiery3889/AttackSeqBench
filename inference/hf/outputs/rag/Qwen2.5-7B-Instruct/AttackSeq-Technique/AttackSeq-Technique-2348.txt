### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where BRONZE PRESIDENT minimizes detection by deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion** - This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery** - This technique involves actions that prevent the system from recovering from an attack, such as deleting system restore points.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing** - This technique involves manipulating process arguments to evade detection. It does not directly follow the actions of deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass** - This technique involves bypassing security gatekeepers, which is not directly related to the actions described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using phishing to obtain information, which is not related to the actions of deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which can include deleting files and system restore points. This aligns well with the actions described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the actions described, is T1070-Indicator Removal, as it directly addresses the removal of indicators of compromise, such as volume shadow copies and system restore points.

**Final Answer: D**
