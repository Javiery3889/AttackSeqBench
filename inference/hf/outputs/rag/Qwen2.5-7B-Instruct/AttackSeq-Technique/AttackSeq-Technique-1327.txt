Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where CosmicDuke:
1. Utilizes Discovery techniques to identify targeted files.
2. Identifies files with non-English encryption cipher-related names.
3. Gathers information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery: This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices, which aligns with the action of gathering information from removable drives.
- T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique involves identifying files and directories, which aligns with the action of identifying targeted files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1127.002-ClickOnce**: This technique is related to the ClickOnce deployment mechanism, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials, which does not align with the described actions.
- **C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not directly related to the described actions.
- **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves accessing data from removable media, which aligns with the action of gathering information from removable drives.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Techniques**: The question mentions the use of Discovery techniques, which aligns with T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery and T1083-File and Directory Discovery.
2. **Identifying Targeted Files**: The question specifies identifying files with non-English encryption cipher-related names, which is a specific subset of file and directory discovery.
3. **Gathering Information from Removable Drives**: The question states that information is gathered from removable drives, which aligns with T1025-Data from Removable Media.

Given the context and the specific actions described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1025-Data from Removable Media.

### Final Answer: D
