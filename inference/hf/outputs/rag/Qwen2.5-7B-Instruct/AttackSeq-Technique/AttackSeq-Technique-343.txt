Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that facilitated communication with compromised systems before the use of dynamic resolution as a Command and Control technique in the context of the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** T1568-Dynamic Resolution

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1665-Hide Infrastructure (A):** This technique is about hiding infrastructure used for C2, which is not directly related to the initial communication phase.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B):** This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2, which could be a method of initial communication but is not specifically related to the supply chain compromise.
- **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (C):** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malicious code. This is directly related to the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, where the attackers used a compromised update to SolarWinds' Orion software to gain initial access.
- **T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature (D):** This technique involves using invalid code signatures to evade detection, which is not directly related to the initial communication phase.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain):** This technique was used to deliver the initial payload (the compromised update) to the SolarWinds Orion platform. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
2. **Command and Control (T1568-Dynamic Resolution):** This technique is used after initial access to establish a C2 channel. However, the question asks about the technique that facilitated communication before dynamic resolution.

Given that the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise involved a supply chain attack to deliver the initial payload, the technique that facilitated communication with the compromised systems would be the one used to deliver the payload in the first place.

### Final Answer: C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
