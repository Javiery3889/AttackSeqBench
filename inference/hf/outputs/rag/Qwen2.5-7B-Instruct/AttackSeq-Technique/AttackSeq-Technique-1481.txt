Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where Babar's dropper reduces forensic artifacts by executing a command line through spawning a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from disk. This indicates that the dropper is taking steps to hide its presence after execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice to see which one aligns best with the described sequence of actions.

- **A: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - This TTP involves using a keychain to store credentials or other sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the described action of deleting the dropper binary.

- **B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
  - This TTP involves executing a payload or command when a specific event occurs. It does not directly relate to the described action of deleting the dropper binary.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This TTP involves techniques to hide the presence of malicious artifacts on the system. While it is related to the concept of reducing forensic artifacts, it is not specifically about deleting the dropper binary.

- **D: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**
  - This TTP involves smuggling HTML content into other file types to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the described action of deleting the dropper binary.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly involves the action of deleting the dropper binary. The related TTP T1070.004-File Deletion is the closest match to the described action.

Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts (Although not a perfect match, it is the closest to the described action of reducing forensic artifacts, which includes deleting the dropper binary.)
