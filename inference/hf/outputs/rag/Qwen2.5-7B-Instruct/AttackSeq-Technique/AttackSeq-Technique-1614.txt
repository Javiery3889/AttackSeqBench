Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group used hardcoded FEIB user accounts to perform lateral movement through SMB shares. The next step in the attack sequence is to disrupt the bank's operations and delay the response to the heist.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention "Lateral Movement" and "T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares." This indicates that the attack involves moving laterally within the network using SMB shares.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery
- **Description**: This technique involves preventing the system from recovering from a state of failure, such as preventing the system from rebooting or preventing the system from restoring from a backup.
- **Relevance**: This technique could be used to prevent the system from recovering, but it doesn't directly disrupt operations or delay response in the context of a heist.

#### B: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass
- **Description**: This technique involves bypassing the Mark of the Web (MOTW) to execute malicious content in a web browser.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to web-based attacks and doesn't align with the SMB/Windows Admin Shares context.

#### C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- **Description**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to perform actions that are not intended by the protocol's design.
- **Relevance**: This technique could be used to perform actions that disrupt operations, but it is more general and doesn't specifically address the need to delay the response to the heist.

#### D: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking
- **Description**: This technique involves hijacking a compute resource to perform malicious actions, such as running malware or performing denial-of-service attacks.
- **Relevance**: This technique can be used to disrupt operations and delay the response by overloading the system with malicious activities, making it harder for the bank to respond effectively.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The attack sequence involves lateral movement through SMB shares.
- **Step 2**: The next step is to disrupt the bank's operations and delay the response.
- **Step 3**: Among the given options, T1496.001-Compute Hijacking is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need to disrupt operations and delay the response by overloading the system with malicious activities.

### Final Answer: D: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking
