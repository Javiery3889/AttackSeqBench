Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to interact with a malicious link leading to trojanized files under the guise of 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures. The subsequent action is the removal of attack artifacts through a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Defense Evasion" and the techniques are:
- T1070-Indicator Removal
- T1070.004-File Deletion

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (A)**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it could be used to run the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, it does not directly address the removal of attack artifacts.
- **T1585-Establish Accounts (B)**: This technique involves creating or modifying user accounts to gain access to systems. It does not align with the removal of attack artifacts.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (C)**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It does not align with the removal of attack artifacts.
- **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell (D)**: This sub-technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands. While it could be used to run the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, it does not directly address the removal of attack artifacts.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the related TTPs, the technique that most directly aligns with the removal of attack artifacts is T1070.004-File Deletion. This technique specifically involves deleting files to remove indicators of compromise.

### Final Answer: 
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the removal of attack artifacts through the script named 'DeleteLeftovers', which aligns with T1070.004-File Deletion.

Final Answer: T1070.004-File Deletion
