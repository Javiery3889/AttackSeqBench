Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Hellsing APT group:
1. They sent a backdoor disguised as a document error message.
2. The backdoor then connected to a command server at `philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com`.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoor connected to the command server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the backdoor being disguised as a document.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**: This technique involves stealing Kerberos tickets, which is not directly related to the backdoor connection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing link to deliver malware, which is also not directly related to the backdoor connection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves modifying the registry to ensure a program runs at startup. While this could be a method to ensure persistence, it does not directly relate to the initial delivery of the backdoor.
- **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It is not directly related to the initial delivery of the backdoor.
- **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to deliver malware. The backdoor was disguised as a document error message, which aligns with a phishing attack.
- **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using remote access software to gain access to a system. While this could be a method to establish a connection, it does not directly relate to the initial delivery of the backdoor.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor was disguised as a document error message, which aligns with a phishing attack.
- Phishing is a common method for delivering malware, and the document error message is a form of social engineering.
- The related TTPs mention spearphishing, which is a specific type of phishing attack.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor was delivered via a phishing attack.

### Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing
