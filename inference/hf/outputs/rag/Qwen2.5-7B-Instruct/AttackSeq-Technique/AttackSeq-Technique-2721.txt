Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Lazarus group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. This implies we need to identify the technique that precedes the spear-phishing attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media like USB drives. It does not directly relate to gaining initial access through spear-phishing.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This is a broader category that includes various forms of phishing, including spear-phishing. However, T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is a more specific technique that involves sending malicious attachments via email, which aligns with the question.

- **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network configurations, which is typically done after gaining initial access, not before.

- **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This technique involves using voice-based spear-phishing, which is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the described attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attack sequence involves gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
- The related TTPs mention T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is a specific form of spear-phishing.
- Among the answer choices, T1566-Phishing (B) is the most relevant and specific to the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer: B
