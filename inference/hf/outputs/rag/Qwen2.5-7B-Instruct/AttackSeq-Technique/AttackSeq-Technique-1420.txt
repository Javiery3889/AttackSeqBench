Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ChromeLoader installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic.
2. A subsequent step involves Operation In(ter)ception's malware serving as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2 (Command and Control) server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves monitoring network traffic to discover information.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves signaling to a C2 server to indicate the presence of the malware.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the browser to tailor the attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1547.014-Active Setup**
- This technique involves using Active Setup to run scripts or programs when a user logs on or off. It does not directly relate to intercepting traffic or serving as a downloader.

**B: T1090.002-External Proxy**
- This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic through a third-party server. While it can be used to intercept traffic, it does not directly serve as a downloader for a fourth stage.

**C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
- This technique involves compromising a legitimate software supply chain to deliver malicious software. It is more about the initial compromise rather than the subsequent steps described in the question.

**D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
- This technique involves transferring tools or malware from a C2 server to a target system. Given that the question mentions a fourth stage being downloaded from a C2, this technique aligns well with the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **ChromeLoader installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic**: This aligns with T1040-Network Sniffing.
2. **Operation In(ter)ception's malware serves as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2**: This aligns with T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

### Final Answer: D
