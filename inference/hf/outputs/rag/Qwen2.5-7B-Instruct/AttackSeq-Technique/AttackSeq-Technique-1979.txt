Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Vulnerabilities in VPNs and remote desktop protocols were exploited during reconnaissance.
2. Data was exfiltrated.
3. Systems were encrypted in a ransomware attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique is directly related to the encryption of systems in a ransomware attack.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which aligns with the exploitation of vulnerabilities in VPNs and remote desktop protocols.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain access to systems. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it does not directly align with the exploitation of vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
- **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**: This technique involves compromising software dependencies, which is not directly related to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
- **C: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager**: This technique involves accessing or modifying Windows Credential Manager to gain credentials. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly align with the exploitation of vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which can be part of reconnaissance but does not directly align with the exploitation of vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the exploitation of vulnerabilities in public-facing applications (VPN and remote desktop protocols) during reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs confirm that the initial access technique used was T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
- The sequence of TTPs should logically follow the initial access, which is the exploitation of vulnerabilities, and then proceed to data exfiltration and system encryption.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the initial access technique, which is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

### Final Answer: B
