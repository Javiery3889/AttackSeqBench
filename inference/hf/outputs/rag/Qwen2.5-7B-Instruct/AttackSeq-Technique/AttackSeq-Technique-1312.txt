### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an APT group (APT34) has established persistence using a scheduled task named 'windows update check' that runs `System Manager.exe` every minute.
   - The goal is to maintain communication with the C2 domain `offlineearthquake[.]com` even when the system is offline.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention `T1053.005-Scheduled Task`, which aligns with the persistence technique described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for maintaining communication, it does not directly address the persistence aspect or the offline communication requirement.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. It can be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation but does not directly address maintaining offline communication.
   - **C: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
     - This technique involves infecting shared content (e.g., documents, web pages) to spread malware. It does not directly address the persistence or offline communication requirement.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain communication. It can be used to maintain communication with a C2 server, even when the system is offline, by using protocols that can store data temporarily and resend it when the system comes back online.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the requirement to maintain communication with the C2 domain `offlineearthquake[.]com` even when the system is offline, the most plausible technique is `T1071-Application Layer Protocol`. This technique allows for the use of application layer protocols to maintain communication, which can store data temporarily and resend it when the system comes back online.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
