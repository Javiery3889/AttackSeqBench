### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT28 uses the DDE technique via PowerShell to download a file, which then creates artifacts like a batch file within the infected system.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the following:
     - Tactic: Execution
     - Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
     - Tactic: Execution
     - Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying files or registry entries to ensure that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. However, the question does not mention any boot or logon activities, so this is less likely.
   - **B: T1484.002-Trust Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying trust relationships to gain unauthorized access. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly follow the creation of a batch file as an artifact.
   - **C: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves using a network provider DLL to establish a covert channel. It is not directly related to the creation of a batch file as an artifact.
   - **D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data or deliver payloads. After downloading a file and creating a batch file, the next step could be to use a multi-stage channel to further communicate with the attacker or to exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial actions described in the question is the use of a multi-stage channel to further communicate or exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
