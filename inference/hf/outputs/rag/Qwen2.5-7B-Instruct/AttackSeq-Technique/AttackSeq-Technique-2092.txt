### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Carbanak used Cobalt Strike beacon for network discovery and collected administrative-level credentials.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next in the sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying services running on remote systems.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from a system. While it is a plausible next step after collecting credentials, it does not directly follow the network discovery phase.
   - **Option B: T1003.004-LSA Secrets:** This technique involves dumping LSA secrets, which are also credentials. Similar to Option A, it is a plausible next step but does not directly follow the network discovery phase.
   - **Option C: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network. Given that the initial step was network discovery, this technique would logically follow as the next step to identify specific systems within the network.
   - **Option D: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal:** This technique involves traversing network address translation (NAT) to access internal networks. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly follow the network discovery phase.

### Final Answer:
Based on the sequence of TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible next step after network discovery and collecting credentials would be to identify specific remote systems on the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
