### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Korplug collects data and system information.
   - The final step in the sequence is encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from local systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary command and control (C&C) channel is compromised.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves bidirectional communication, but it does not specifically mention encryption or fallback channels.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027.003-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other data, which is not directly related to encrypted communication or fallback channels.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
     - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is already mentioned in the question (T1005-Data from Local System).
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which could be part of encrypted communication. However, it does not specifically mention fallback channels.
   - **Answer Choice E: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique directly involves using alternative communication channels, which aligns with the question's requirement for encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitates encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers for further interaction is **T1008-Fallback Channels**.

Final Answer: E
