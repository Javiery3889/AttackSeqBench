Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands remotely for lateral movement, the next step is to gather information on network configuration. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation, which is a technique used for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Execution" and the technique "T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation." This confirms that WMI is being used for execution purposes, which is consistent with the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering internet connections, which is not directly related to gathering network configuration information.
  
- **B: T1505-Server Software Component**
  - This technique involves identifying and exploiting server software components, which is not directly related to network configuration discovery.
  
- **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering system network configuration details, which aligns well with the question's requirement to gather information on network configuration.
  
- **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to network configuration discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WMI is used for lateral movement, and the next step is to gather network configuration information.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of WMI for execution.
- Among the answer choices, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (C) is the most relevant and directly addresses the need to gather network configuration information.

### Final Answer: C
