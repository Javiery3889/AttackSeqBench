### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading up to the execution of the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan and communication with a C&C server over TCP port 80.
   - The focus is on the initial step in the campaign, specifically the delivery of malicious attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Command and Control" and "Non-Standard Port" (T1571-Non-Standard Port).
   - T1571-Non-Standard Port indicates that the attackers are using a non-standard port (TCP port 80) for communication, which is consistent with the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1074-Data Staged** - This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration or use, which is not the initial step in delivering malicious attachments.
   - **B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** - This technique involves delivering a malicious link via spearphishing, which is a plausible method for delivering a backdoor Trojan.
   - **C: T1098.006-Additional Container Cluster Roles** - This technique is not relevant to the delivery of malicious attachments or spearphishing.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves delivering a malicious attachment via phishing, which is also a plausible method for delivering a backdoor Trojan.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both B (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) and D (T1566-Phishing) are plausible for delivering a malicious attachment. However, T1566.002-Spearphishing Link specifically mentions a link, which is more aligned with the typical method of delivering a backdoor Trojan via a malicious link in an email or document.
   - Given the context of delivering a backdoor Trojan, the most specific and relevant TTP is T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.

### Final Answer: B
