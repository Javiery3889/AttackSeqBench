### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware first evades detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker using InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility.
   - The malware then executes its payload via proxy execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code.
   - **T1220-XSL Script Processing:** This technique involves processing XSL scripts to evade detection.
   - **T1218.004-InstallUtil:** This technique involves using InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
     - This technique involves reducing the key space to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding payloads in non-standard ways to evade detection. While it could be part of the evasion strategy, it does not directly align with the use of InstallUtil.exe and proxy execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**
     - This technique directly aligns with the described sequence. It involves using trusted developer utilities (like InstallUtil.exe) to execute malicious code via proxy execution, which matches the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
