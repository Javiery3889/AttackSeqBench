### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: deploying a KerrDown downloader, decrypting the payload using DES, and establishing communication for further payload transfer based on the victim's OS architecture.
   - The key points are:
     - Deployment of a downloader (KerrDown).
     - Decryption of the payload using DES.
     - Establishing communication for further payload transfer.
     - The communication depends on the victim's OS architecture.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding information to execute it.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to the target system to establish a command and control channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code or commands in the context of a user account. It does not directly relate to establishing a communication channel.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it is related to obfuscation, it does not directly establish a communication channel.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique directly involves transferring tools to the target system to establish a command and control channel. Given that the question mentions establishing communication for further payload transfer, this technique aligns well with the described sequence.
   - **D: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking a user's browser session. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

Final Answer: C
