Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Turla malware has already used encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade defenses and hide its tracks. The next step in the sequence is gathering specific information from systems to enhance their spying operation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1564.005-Hidden File System
- T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories
- T1014-Rootkit

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1564.005-Hidden File System**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial evasion strategy.
- **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**: This is another technique for hiding files and directories, which is also part of the initial evasion strategy.
- **T1014-Rootkit**: This is a technique for hiding processes, files, and network connections, which is also part of the initial evasion strategy.

### Step 4: Determine the Next Step
The question asks for the next step in the sequence after the initial evasion techniques. The related TTPs do not provide a direct answer to the next step, but we need to consider the context of gathering specific information to enhance the spying operation.

- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which aligns with the need to gather specific information from systems to enhance the spying operation.

### Final Answer
Based on the context and the need to gather specific information, the most plausible next step in the sequence is:

Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
