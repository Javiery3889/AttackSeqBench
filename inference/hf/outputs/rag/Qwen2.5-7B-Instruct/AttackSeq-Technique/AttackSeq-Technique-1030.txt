Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server after using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control. This indicates an exfiltration activity over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated data exfiltration, which aligns with the scenario of documents being automatically uploaded.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is relevant to the question as the data is being sent to the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**
  - This technique is about limiting the size of data transferred, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of harvested documents.
- **Answer Choice B: T1137.006-Add-ins**
  - This technique involves using add-ins to perform malicious actions, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
- **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs to perform malicious actions, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the automatic uploading of harvested documents to the C&C server, which is a form of exfiltration.
- The related TTPs mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which is specifically about exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
- Among the answer choices, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the only one that directly aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
