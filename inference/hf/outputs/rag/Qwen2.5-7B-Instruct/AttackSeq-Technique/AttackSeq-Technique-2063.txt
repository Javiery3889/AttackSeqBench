Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Domain administrator passwords are acquired.
2. All domain accounts are controlled.
3. Anunak malware establishes communication with backends using a PHP-based backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
- This technique involves the use of valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it is related to the initial compromise, it does not directly address the establishment of communication with the backends.

**B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
- This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. This aligns with the first part of the sequence where domain administrator passwords are acquired and all domain accounts are controlled.

**C: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**
- This technique involves generating requests for multi-factor authentication. It is not directly related to the initial compromise or the establishment of communication with the backends.

**D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
- This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to systems. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the initial credential acquisition or the establishment of communication with the backends.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where domain administrator passwords are acquired and all domain accounts are controlled. This aligns with the T1003-OS Credential Dumping technique.
- After acquiring the credentials, the malware establishes communication with backends using a PHP-based backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS. This aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1003-OS Credential Dumping (acquiring domain administrator passwords and controlling all domain accounts)
2. T1071.001-Web Protocols (establishing communication with backends using a PHP-based backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS)

Therefore, the answer that best fits the sequence described in the question is:

**Final Answer: B**
