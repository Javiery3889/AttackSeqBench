Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT-TOCS evaded detection by executing malicious code in memory without any hard disk activity and running multi-beacon communication. This indicates that the attack involved techniques to avoid detection and to maintain persistence in memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**: This technique involves using time-based methods to evade detection, which aligns with the need to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection, which is relevant to executing code in memory.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection, which is also relevant to executing code in memory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which is not directly related to executing code in memory or evading detection.
- **Answer Choice B: T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique involves using cloud APIs, which is not directly related to executing code in memory or evading detection.
- **Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to executing code in memory or evading detection.
- **Answer Choice D: T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes**: This technique involves manipulating file attributes, which is not directly related to executing code in memory or evading detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes executing malicious code in memory and multi-beacon communication, which aligns with the techniques of process injection and portable executable injection.
- The related TTPs mention techniques such as T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection and T1055-Process Injection, which are directly related to executing code in memory and evading detection.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection and T1055-Process Injection.

**Final Answer: D**
