Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Initial access is gained by exploiting public-facing applications.
2. Webshells are deployed for lateral movement.
3. Agrius uses compromised accounts and tools to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement
- Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the TTP that most likely occurred before Agrius used compromised accounts and tools to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.

- **Option A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
  - This TTP involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote access. While it is a form of remote service, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not directly align with the use of RDP.

- **Option B: T1543.003-Windows Service**
  - This TTP involves using a Windows service to maintain persistence or perform actions. It is not directly related to RDP or the tunneling of RDP traffic.

- **Option C: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
  - This TTP involves encrypting data to impact the victim. It is not directly related to the lateral movement via RDP.

- **Option D: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This TTP involves using remote services to establish a connection. T1021.001 specifically mentions RDP, which aligns with the use of RDP for tunneling traffic. This TTP is directly related to the use of RDP for lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of RDP for tunneling traffic, which is directly related to T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol.
- The related TTPs mention T1021.001, which is the most relevant to the use of RDP.
- The TTP that most likely occurred before using compromised accounts and tools to tunnel RDP traffic is the initial use of RDP itself, which is covered by T1021-Remote Services.

### Final Answer: D
