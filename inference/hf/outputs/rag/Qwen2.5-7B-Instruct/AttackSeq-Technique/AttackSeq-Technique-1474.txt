Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a SLUB backdoor communicates with attackers via Slack using hardcoded authentication tokens. The key points are:
- The backdoor communicates with Slack.
- Hardcoded authentication tokens are used.
- Messages and command results are posted to a private Slack channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat messages for credential access.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves bidirectional communication for command and control.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback channels for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving data, which does not align with the communication and posting of messages to Slack.
- **B: T1588.004-Digital Certificates**: This technique involves using digital certificates, which is not directly related to the communication and posting of messages to Slack.
- **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding, which is not directly related to the communication and posting of messages to Slack.
- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols, which aligns with the communication via Slack. However, it does not specifically address the use of hardcoded authentication tokens.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the backdoor communicates with Slack using hardcoded authentication tokens.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for command and control and credential access, which are relevant.
- Among the answer choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the closest to the communication aspect, but it does not specifically address the use of hardcoded authentication tokens.
- The technique that most directly addresses the use of hardcoded authentication tokens for communication is not explicitly listed among the choices, but the closest related technique is **T1552.008-Chat Messages**, which involves using chat messages for credential access.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves the use of chat messages for credential access, which aligns with the communication via Slack.

### Final Answer: C
