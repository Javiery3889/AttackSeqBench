Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Derusbi malware gathers host and system information.
2. An action occurs after this gathering.
3. This action is followed by the malware's communication traffic to the C2 using obfuscated HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided information:

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the communication or data obfuscation described in the question.

- **B: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary channel is detected or blocked. While it is related to Command and Control, it does not specifically address the obfuscation of HTTP POST requests.

- **C: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves making the malware appear as legitimate software to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the communication or data obfuscation described in the question.

- **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
  - This technique involves encoding or encrypting data to avoid detection. Given that the question mentions "obfuscated HTTP POST requests," this technique directly aligns with the described action.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware gathers information, then performs an action, and finally communicates using obfuscated HTTP POST requests.
- The related TTPs mention T1001-Data Obfuscation, which directly aligns with the obfuscation of HTTP POST requests.
- None of the other TTPs (T1129, T1008, T1036) directly relate to the obfuscation of data in HTTP POST requests.

### Final Answer: D: T1001-Data Obfuscation
