### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an RMS (Rogue Malware) tool is used to evade detection through legitimate application functions.
   - The RMS executable then establishes communication with a C2 server located in Germany.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves the attacker using legitimate names or locations to evade detection. This aligns with the evasion through legitimate application functions.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection. This is also related to the evasion aspect but not directly to the communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves executing code or programs in a way that mimics legitimate user behavior. While it can be part of the evasion strategy, it does not directly address the communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:** This technique involves rapidly changing the IP addresses associated with a domain name to evade detection. This could be a plausible method for the C2 server communication, but it is not directly related to the evasion through legitimate application functions.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish command and control (C2) communications. This directly addresses the communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically involving web protocols. While it is related to T1071, it is more specific and less general than T1071 itself.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is the use of an application layer protocol to establish communication with the C2 server.
   - **Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
