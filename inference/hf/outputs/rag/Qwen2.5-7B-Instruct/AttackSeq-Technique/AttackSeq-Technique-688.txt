### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Pierogi backdoor leverages a shortcut in the startup folder for persistence.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique enabled the execution of the embedded downloader macro to install the backdoor before the persistence step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Persistence" and "Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder."
   - This indicates that the backdoor uses the startup folder for persistence, but we need to find the technique that enabled the execution of the macro.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication** - This technique is not directly related to the execution of a macro or the initial execution of a backdoor.
   - **B: T1569-System Services** - This technique involves creating or modifying system services, which is not directly related to the execution of a macro.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves creating or modifying web services, which is also not directly related to the execution of a macro.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves techniques that encourage or require user interaction to execute a payload. This could include executing a macro, which is a plausible method for installing a backdoor.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that enabled the execution of the embedded downloader macro to install the backdoor is T1204-User Execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution**
