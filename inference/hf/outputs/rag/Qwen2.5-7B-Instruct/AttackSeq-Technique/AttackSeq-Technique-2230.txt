Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where machines in a compromised network environment are discovered using scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan. The goal is to facilitate lateral movement by transferring tools and establishing network tunnels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using covert channels to exfiltrate data or maintain access. It does not directly relate to transferring tools or establishing network tunnels for lateral movement.
- **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves using legitimate mechanisms to gain higher privileges. It does not align with the context of transferring tools or establishing network tunnels.
- **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique directly involves transferring tools to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement. It aligns well with the goal of establishing network tunnels and transferring tools.
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves deploying software to systems. While it can be part of the process, it does not specifically address the transfer of tools and establishing network tunnels for lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Phase**: The use of scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan indicates the initial discovery phase, which is covered by T1046-Network Service Discovery.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The goal is to facilitate lateral movement by transferring tools and establishing network tunnels. This aligns directly with T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.

### Final Answer: C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
