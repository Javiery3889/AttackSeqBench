### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the callCam app collected and encrypted sensitive data. The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of this data over a C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Exfiltration" and the techniques mentioned are:
     - T1020-Automated Exfiltration
     - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique is related to the use of a bootkit to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique directly relates to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, which matches the description in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which is a preparatory step before exfiltration but not the exfiltration itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltration over an alternative protocol, which is also a form of exfiltration but not specifically over a C2 channel.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the callCam app collected and encrypted sensitive data, the next step was the exfiltration of this data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: B
