### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GroundPeony used spear-phishing emails with lure documents and URL obfuscation to distribute malicious payloads from compromised websites.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial spear-phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and specifically "Spearphishing Link" (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
   - This indicates that the spear-phishing attack is part of the initial access tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique is not directly related to the distribution of malicious payloads from compromised websites. It is more about internal spear-phishing, which is not the next step after the initial spear-phishing attack.
   - **B: T1059.004-Unix Shell**
     - This technique involves using a Unix shell, which is not directly related to the distribution of malicious payloads from compromised websites. It is more about gaining a command-line interface, which is a step after the payload is delivered.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. Given that the spear-phishing emails used URL obfuscation, this technique could be a follow-up to ensure the malicious payload is not easily detected.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. While this is a step after the payload is delivered, it is more about executing commands rather than ensuring the payload is not detected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is that after the spear-phishing attack, the next step would be to ensure the malicious payload is not easily detected. Therefore, the technique that aligns best with this is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
