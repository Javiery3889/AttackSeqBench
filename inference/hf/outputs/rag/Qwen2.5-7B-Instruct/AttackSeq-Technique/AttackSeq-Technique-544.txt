Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the threat actors gained initial access via spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the execution of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code, which is relevant to the malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves the use of spearphishing campaigns with attachments to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure for an operation. It is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
- **Answer Choice B: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**: This technique involves flooding a system with requests to exhaust resources. It is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
- **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to gain access to the target network. While it can be a method of initial access, it is not the most direct or likely method in the context of the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious files. The related TTPs specifically mention spearphishing, which aligns with the question's description of malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the threat actors gained initial access via spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.
- The related TTPs mention T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which directly aligns with the question's description.
- None of the other techniques (T1583, T1499.001, or T1195) are as directly related to the initial access via spearphishing as T1566.

### Final Answer: D
