Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Screenshots taken every minute using a backdoor.
2. Harvested sensitive data from removable drives.
3. Data uploaded to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection Tactic**: 
  - T1025-Data from Removable Media: This technique involves collecting data from removable media.
- **Exfiltration Tactic**:
  - T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This technique involves the automated transfer of data to an external location.
- **Collection Tactic**:
  - T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTPs align with the sequence of actions described in the question.

- **Option A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique is not directly related to the sequence of actions described. It is more about reducing the key space for encryption, which is not relevant here.

- **Option B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. While it is related to uploading data to a C&C server, it does not directly address the collection of data from removable drives.

- **Option C: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing data through a web portal. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.

- **Option D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - This technique directly involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the second step in the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Collection of Data from Removable Media (T1025)**: This is the first step where sensitive data is harvested from removable drives.
2. **Screenshots Taken Every Minute Using a Backdoor**: This step is not directly related to the TTPs provided but is part of the overall attack sequence.
3. **Exfiltration of Data to C&C Server**: This step would involve uploading the collected data to the C&C server, which could be done through various techniques, but the question does not specify this step.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the collection of data from removable drives.

### Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media
