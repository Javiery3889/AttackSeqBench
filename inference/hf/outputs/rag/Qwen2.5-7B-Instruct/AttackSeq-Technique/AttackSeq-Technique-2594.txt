### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first uses 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion and then gathers detailed system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Discovery" and the technique "T1049-System Network Connections Discovery." This indicates that the malware is performing a discovery activity, specifically focusing on network connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it is related to network activity, it does not specifically focus on discovering network connections.
   - **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique directly involves gathering information about network connections, which aligns perfectly with the question's description of the malware gathering detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections.
   - **C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not directly related to the specific network connection information described in the question.
   - **D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
     - This technique involves adding entries to the XDG autostart directory to ensure persistence. It does not align with the described network discovery activity.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by the technique that directly involves gathering network connection information. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
