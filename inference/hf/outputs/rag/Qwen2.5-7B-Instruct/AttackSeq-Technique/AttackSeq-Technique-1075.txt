Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Reconnaissance using system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`.
2. Initial access to the network through targeted communication channels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering network configuration information, which aligns with the reconnaissance activities using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves using a service to deliver a spearphishing attack, which is a targeted communication channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique is part of the Discovery tactic and aligns with the reconnaissance activities using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`. However, it does not directly address the initial access through targeted communication channels.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This technique is not listed in the related TTPs and does not align with the provided context.

- **Answer Choice C: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves compromising cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the targeted communication channels mentioned in the question. The related TTP T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service is a specific method of phishing, which is a subset of the broader T1566 technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes reconnaissance activities using system utilities, which aligns with T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
- The initial access through targeted communication channels aligns with the broader T1566-Phishing technique, which encompasses spearphishing via service (T1566.003).

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1566-Phishing, as it encompasses the targeted communication channel used for initial access.

**Final Answer: D**
