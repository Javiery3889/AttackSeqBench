Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a backdoor has been used to collect data and establish communication with a C&C server using a specific protocol. The question asks which ATT&CK technique ensures that the data transmission with the C&C server is secure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
  - **Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary C2 channel is detected or blocked.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to secure data transmission. Given that the question asks for a technique to ensure secure data transmission, this is a strong candidate.
- **Answer Choice B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for C2. While this can be part of a broader security strategy, it does not directly address the secure transmission of data.
- **Answer Choice C: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system. It does not pertain to securing data transmission.
- **Answer Choice D: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**
  - This technique involves using ROMMON (Remote Operations Mode Monitor) to gain access to a device. It does not pertain to securing data transmission.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks for a technique to ensure secure data transmission with the C&C server.
- Among the given choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant and directly addresses the need for secure data transmission.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1071.001-Web Protocols, suggest the use of web protocols for C2, which can be secured using encrypted channels.

### Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
