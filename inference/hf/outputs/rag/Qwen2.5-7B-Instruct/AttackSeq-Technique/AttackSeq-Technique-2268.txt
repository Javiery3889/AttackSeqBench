Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST web request.
2. A PowerShell script communicates with domains to download malware and send collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Exfiltration**: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
- This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. It does not directly relate to the communication of a PowerShell script with domains to download malware and send collected data.

**B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
- This technique involves modifying the PowerShell profile to execute malicious code. While it can be used to execute PowerShell scripts, it does not directly address the communication with domains to download malware and send collected data.

**C: T1114-Email Collection**
- This technique involves collecting email addresses or other email-related information. It is related to the initial exfiltration of email accounts but does not address the communication with domains to download malware and send collected data.

**D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to exfiltrate data. Given that the question mentions a POST web request, this technique aligns well with the communication aspect of the question. Additionally, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which is related to the tactic of exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel, suggests that the communication is part of a broader C2 channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is exfiltrated and then a PowerShell script communicates with domains to download malware and send collected data.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is directly related to the use of web requests (POST) for exfiltration.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel further supports the idea that the communication with domains is part of a broader C2 channel.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
