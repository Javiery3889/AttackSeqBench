### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a keylogger is used to capture keystrokes, leading to the capture of additional accounts.
   - The next step in the sequence is the repeated attempt to reset passwords to maintain prolonged access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the use of keylogging, which aligns with the initial step of capturing keystrokes.
   - The tactics mentioned are "Collection" and "Credential Access," which are relevant to the overall context of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to access systems. While it is related to credential access, it does not directly describe the process of gaining access through keylogging.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. It is not directly related to the sequence of capturing keystrokes and then attempting password resets.
   - **C: T1137.005-Outlook Rules**
     - This technique involves modifying Outlook rules to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the sequence of capturing keystrokes and then attempting password resets.
   - **D: T1098-Account Manipulation**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating accounts to gain or maintain access. It aligns well with the next step in the sequence, which is the repeated attempt to reset passwords to maintain access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after capturing keystrokes and gaining access to additional accounts, the next step is account manipulation to maintain access through repeated password resets.

**Final Answer: D: T1098-Account Manipulation**
