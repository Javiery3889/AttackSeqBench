Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to load a malicious `wab32res.dll` via `sidebar.exe`.
2. A hidden directory was created in the system.
3. The backdoor DLL was injected into the legitimate process `dllhost.exe`.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoor DLL was injected into `dllhost.exe` for Defense Evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL.
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process by manipulating the search order or side-loading.
- **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique is about removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. It does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not relevant to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **C: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process. While it is related to the final step of the sequence, it does not directly address the step before the DLL injection.
- **D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order for DLLs, which aligns with the initial step of loading the malicious `wab32res.dll` via `sidebar.exe`. This technique is a common method for DLL hijacking, which is a precursor to the injection of the backdoor DLL into `dllhost.exe`.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to load the malicious `wab32res.dll` via `sidebar.exe`. This aligns with the technique of **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**.
- **Step 2**: A hidden directory was created in the system. This step is not directly related to the TTPs provided but is a common tactic for persistence.
- **Step 3**: The backdoor DLL was injected into the legitimate process `dllhost.exe`. This aligns with the technique of **T1055-Process Injection**.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before the backdoor DLL was injected into `dllhost.exe` is **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**.

### Final Answer: C
