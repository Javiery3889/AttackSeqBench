Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where a Linux Turla sample intercepts incoming packets without root access and executes commands via '/bin/sh -c'. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell**: This technique involves using a Unix shell to execute commands. This is relevant as the sample uses '/bin/sh -c' to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to maintain command and control. This is relevant for ongoing communication and control post-execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**: This technique involves modifying the PATH environment variable to intercept and execute malicious code. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly follow the execution of commands via '/bin/sh -c'.
- **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise. It is not directly related to the execution of commands or ongoing command and control.
- **Answer Choice C: T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. While it could be used for ongoing execution, it is not the most direct follow-up to the immediate execution of commands.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. Given that the sample uses '/bin/sh -c' to execute commands, this is the most direct and relevant follow-up technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial action involves intercepting packets and executing commands via '/bin/sh -c'.
- The most relevant technique that directly follows this action is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, as it aligns with the use of '/bin/sh -c' to execute commands.
- Other techniques like T1070-Indicator Removal or T1053.003-Cron are not as directly relevant to the immediate execution of commands.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
