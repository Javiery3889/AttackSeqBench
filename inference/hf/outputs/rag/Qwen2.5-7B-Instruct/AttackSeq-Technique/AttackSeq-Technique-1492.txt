Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs using steganography.
2. ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This TTP is related to using mail protocols for command and control. It does not directly relate to the use of steganography or RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

- **Answer Choice B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - This TTP is related to using hybrid identities to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the use of steganography or RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

- **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This TTP is related to using encrypted channels for command and control. While it involves encryption, it does not specifically mention RC4 or HTTP POST beacons.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This TTP is related to using phishing to deliver malware. It does not directly relate to the use of steganography or RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the use of steganography and encrypted channels for command and control. However, none of the provided answer choices directly match the specific techniques mentioned in the question (RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons).

Since the question specifically mentions RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons, and none of the provided choices directly match this, the closest match would be an encrypted channel, which is related to the use of encryption for command and control.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
