### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: staging collected data in a temporary folder, encrypting it, and then transmitting the files to C&C servers.
   - The focus is on the transmission step after data staging and encryption.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves storing data locally before exfiltration.
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves storing data remotely before exfiltration.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves archiving data for later exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique is about discovering network configurations, which is not directly related to the transmission of exfiltrated data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not a C2 channel. This could be a plausible choice if the data is encrypted and transmitted over a non-C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a channel that is specifically used for C2 communication. This is a strong candidate since the question mentions C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities or services on a network, which is not directly related to the transmission of exfiltrated data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** because it directly involves transmitting data to C&C servers, which aligns with the question's description of transmitting files to C&C servers after encryption.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
