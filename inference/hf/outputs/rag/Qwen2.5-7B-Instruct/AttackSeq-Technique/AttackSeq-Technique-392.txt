Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Vyveva's backdoor collects files from the system and newly inserted removable media, then exfiltrates the collected data in an encrypted manner. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection Tactic**: T1025-Data from Removable Media
- **Exfiltration Tactic**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**
  - This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise. It does not directly relate to the collection or exfiltration of data.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves automated collection of data. It aligns with the collection of files from the system and removable media, which is part of the question.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. The question states that the data is exfiltrated in an encrypted manner, which aligns with this technique. However, this is the exfiltration step, not the collection step.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves archiving collected data. While it could be a step in the process, it is not explicitly mentioned in the question and does not directly precede the exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the backdoor collecting files from the system and removable media. This aligns with the T1025-Data from Removable Media technique.
- After collection, the data is exfiltrated in an encrypted manner, which aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.
- The technique that most likely occurred before exfiltrating the collected data is the automated collection of files from the system and removable media.

### Final Answer: B
