Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Compromised domain credentials were used to access shared folders.
2. The NodeIISWeb web shell loader was dropped via SMB.
3. The goal is to compromise additional servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1078.002-Domain Accounts
- **Lateral Movement**: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares, T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
  - This technique involves using a legitimate administrative account to perform actions that would otherwise require elevated privileges. It does not directly fit the sequence described in the question.

- **B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
  - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to execute code on a remote system. It is not directly related to the SMB/Windows Admin Shares or the lateral movement described.

- **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
  - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to communicate between systems. It is not directly related to the SMB/Windows Admin Shares or the lateral movement described.

- **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system to gain access or perform actions. Given that the NodeIISWeb web shell loader was dropped via SMB, this technique aligns well with the described sequence. The web shell loader is a remote service that can be exploited to gain access to additional servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves accessing shared folders using compromised domain credentials, dropping a web shell loader via SMB, and then compromising additional servers.
- The related TTPs indicate that the technique T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is relevant to the described sequence, as it involves exploiting a service (the web shell loader) to gain access to additional servers.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
