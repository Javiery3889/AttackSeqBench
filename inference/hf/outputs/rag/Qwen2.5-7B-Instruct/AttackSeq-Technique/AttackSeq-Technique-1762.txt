Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malicious VBS scripts are executed and persistence is maintained through scheduled tasks.
   - Shuckworm then downloads additional payloads from their C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention T1053.005-Scheduled Task, which is a sub-technique of T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.
   - This indicates that the persistence mechanism involves scheduled tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools or data from an external source to the target system. While it fits the context of downloading additional payloads, it does not directly relate to the persistence mechanism described.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to run malicious code. Given that the question mentions maintaining persistence through scheduled tasks, this technique aligns well with the described persistence mechanism.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through multiple systems. It does not directly relate to the persistence or execution described in the question.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain** - This technique involves stealing or using credentials stored in a keychain. It does not fit the context of downloading additional payloads or maintaining persistence through scheduled tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, as it directly relates to the persistence mechanism mentioned in the question.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

Final Answer: B
