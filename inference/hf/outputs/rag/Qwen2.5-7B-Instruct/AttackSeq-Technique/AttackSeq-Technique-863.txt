### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy used its malware framework to develop modular espionage tools for keylogging and file extraction.
   - The sequence continues with the use of distinct infection vectors such as spearphishing and compromised web servers for initial access.
   - We need to identify the technique that most likely occurred after the development of the modular espionage tools and before the use of spearphishing and compromised web servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware** - This technique is directly related to the development of modular espionage tools.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** and **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - These techniques are related to the use of spearphishing as an initial access vector.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1590.005-IP Addresses** - This technique is about using IP addresses for command and control (C2) communications, which is not directly related to the development of modular espionage tools or the initial access vectors.
   - **B: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption** - This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not directly related to the development of modular espionage tools or the initial access vectors.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding artifacts on the target system, which could be a step taken after the development of modular espionage tools and before using spearphishing or compromised web servers to ensure the persistence and stealth of the malware.
   - **D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information** - This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization, which is more likely to occur before the initial access vectors are used.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the development of modular espionage tools (T1587.001-Malware) and before the use of spearphishing and compromised web servers for initial access, the technique that aligns best is hiding artifacts on the target system.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
