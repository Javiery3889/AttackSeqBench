Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information.
2. Bidirectional communication with C2 servers using HTTPS protocol.
3. Encryption with RC4.
4. Base64 encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is relevant as it pertains to the communication between the malware and the C2 server.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of HTTPS.
- **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves standard encoding methods, which aligns with the use of Base64 encoding.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 communication. While it can be part of a broader strategy, it does not directly address the use of HTTPS, RC4, and Base64 encoding.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to using HTTPS, it does not specifically mention the use of RC4 and Base64 encoding.
- **C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs**: This technique involves using application certification DLLs to evade detection. It does not align with the described communication method.
- **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs for command and control. It does not align with the described communication method.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes bidirectional communication with C2 servers using HTTPS, which aligns with **T1071.001-Web Protocols**.
- The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding is a form of standard encoding, which aligns with **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**.
- The combination of HTTPS and standard encoding (Base64) is a common method to obfuscate C2 communication.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1071.001-Web Protocols** for the HTTPS communication and **T1132.001-Standard Encoding** for the Base64 encoding.

However, the question asks for a single TTP that best describes the bidirectional communication with C2 servers using HTTPS, and the related TTPs do not directly mention HTTPS but do mention web protocols.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
