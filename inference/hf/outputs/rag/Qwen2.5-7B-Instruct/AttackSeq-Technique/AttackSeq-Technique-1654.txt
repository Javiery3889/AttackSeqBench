### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability is used to gain a foothold, followed by a watering hole attack delivering an Internet Explorer zero-day.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
     - Executing a watering hole attack.
     - Delivering an Internet Explorer zero-day.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are under the Tactic: Initial Access, and the specific technique is T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise involves compromising a website or web application to deliver malicious content to users when they visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. It does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **B: T1547.012-Print Processors** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in print spooler services. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **C: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain** - This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** - This technique directly involves compromising a website or web application to deliver malicious content, which aligns with the watering hole attack described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
