Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after PyFlash gathered system and network information for discovery and sent it to a C&C server, we need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the initial gathering of system and network information.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves sending the gathered information to a C&C server, which aligns with the question's statement that the information was sent to a C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Gathering**: The question mentions that PyFlash gathered system and network information for discovery. This aligns with **T1082-System Information Discovery**.
2. **Sending to C&C Server**: After gathering the information, the question states that it was sent to a C&C server. This aligns with **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **T1082-System Information Discovery** (initial gathering)
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** (sending to C&C server)

Therefore, the most plausible answer is **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

### Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
