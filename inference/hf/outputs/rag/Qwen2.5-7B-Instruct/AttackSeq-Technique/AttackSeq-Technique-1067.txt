Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via watering hole tactics exploiting vulnerabilities in Chrome and Internet Explorer.
2. A privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458) using a PowerShell loader.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** The related TTPs mention "Exploit Public-Facing Application" (T1190), which aligns with the watering hole tactics exploiting vulnerabilities in browsers.
- **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** The related TTPs mention "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" (T1068), which aligns with the use of a PowerShell loader to exploit the privilege escalation vulnerability.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the TTP that logically occurs between the initial access and the privilege escalation.

- **A: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique is not directly related to the sequence of initial access and privilege escalation.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter, which could be part of the privilege escalation process but is not directly related to the initial access.
- **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image** - This technique involves using a malicious image, which is not directly related to the initial access via watering hole tactics or the privilege escalation process.
- **D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way, which could be used in various stages of the attack but is not directly related to the initial access or privilege escalation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is via exploiting vulnerabilities in browsers (T1190).
- The next step is likely to be some form of payload delivery or execution, which could involve a command or scripting interpreter (T1059).
- The final step is the privilege escalation using a PowerShell loader (T1068).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurs before the privilege escalation is the use of a command or scripting interpreter to execute the payload.

### Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
