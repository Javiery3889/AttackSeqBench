Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Hidden Cobra (a known APT group) uses a malicious Word document for targeted spear phishing emails.
2. The Bankshot implant is attached to this document.
3. The Bankshot implant exploits CVE-2018-4878 using an embedded Flash script.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1588.005-Exploits**: This technique is related to exploitation, but it is not specifically about client-side exploitation using a document or script. It is more general and does not fit the specific context of the question.
  
- **B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique is about acquiring infrastructure, which is not directly related to the spear phishing or exploitation steps described in the question.
  
- **C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the target organization, which is a common initial step in a targeted attack. It aligns well with the context of a targeted spear phishing attack.
  
- **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts, which is more about credential theft or using existing accounts. It does not fit the context of the spear phishing and exploitation described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a targeted spear phishing attack, which is an initial access technique (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
- The next step in the sequence is the exploitation of the document, which is a form of execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)
2. Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution)

Among the provided answer choices, the one that best fits the initial access step is:
- **C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**

Final Answer: C
