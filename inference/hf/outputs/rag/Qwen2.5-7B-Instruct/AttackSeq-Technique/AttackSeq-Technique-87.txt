Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that the malware gathered information including keystrokes before exfiltrating the data via encrypted emails. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique was used for this keystroke data collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data locally before exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is not directly related to keystroke data collection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1056-Input Capture**: This is a broader category that includes keylogging, but the specific technique for keylogging is T1056.001.
- **Answer Choice B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique is about accessing data from network shared drives, which is not relevant to keystroke data collection.
- **Answer Choice C: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique is about staging data locally, which is a step after data collection but not the technique used for collecting keystrokes.
- **Answer Choice D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is about signaling network traffic, which is not relevant to keystroke data collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions that the malware gathered keystrokes before exfiltrating the data.
- The related TTPs mention T1056.001-Keylogging, which is the specific technique for capturing keystrokes.
- T1074.001-Local Data Staging is a technique for staging data locally, which is a step after data collection, not the technique used for collecting keystrokes.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the technique used for capturing keystrokes, which is T1056.001-Keylogging.

**Final Answer: A**
