### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where ShadowTech RAT is deployed via a malicious executable during Initial Access.
   - The malware then ensures persistence by adding a registry key under 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Persistence tactic.
   - T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL: This technique involves adding a DLL to the Winlogon process to ensure persistence.
   - T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder: This technique involves adding a registry key to the Run or Startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique involves ensuring that malware runs when the system boots or a user logs on.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique is about transferring tools to the target system, which is not directly related to persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique is about using systemd timers to ensure persistence, but it is not directly related to the Winlogon registry key.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is about ensuring that malware runs when the system boots or a user logs on, which is a broad technique that could include adding a registry key under Winlogon.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1137.006-Add-ins**
     - This technique is about adding add-ins to applications, which is not directly related to persistence via the Winlogon registry key.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of adding a registry key under 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon', is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

### Final Answer: C
