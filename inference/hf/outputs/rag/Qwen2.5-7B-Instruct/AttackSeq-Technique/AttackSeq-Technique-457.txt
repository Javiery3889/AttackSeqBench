Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a rootkit gathers browsing data and then establishes communication with its C&C domains to download the homepage configuration. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely to be used for the communication with the C&C domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1189-Drive-by Compromise
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** T1071.004-DNS

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
  - This technique is not related to establishing communication with C&C domains or initial access. It is more about managing customer relationships, which is not relevant here.

- **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C domains or initial access. It is more about traffic management, which is not relevant here.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish communication with C&C domains. Given that the rootkit needs to communicate with its C&C domains, this technique is a strong candidate.

- **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. While it is related to initial access, it does not directly address the communication with C&C domains.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The rootkit gathers browsing data, which is a form of initial access.
- To establish communication with the C&C domains, the rootkit would need to use an application layer protocol to send and receive data.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.004-DNS, which is a specific sub-technique of T1071, indicating that DNS is used for C&C communication.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is using an application layer protocol to communicate with the C&C domains.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
