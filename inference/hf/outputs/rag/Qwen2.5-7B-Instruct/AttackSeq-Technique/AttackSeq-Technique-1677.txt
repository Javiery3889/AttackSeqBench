Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs during the discovery phase:
1. The attackers profiled the computer.
2. They searched for computer objects in the Active Directory database.
3. They executed commands and performed process injection on remote computers for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the search for computer objects in the Active Directory database.
- **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying processes running on a system, which could be part of the profiling and preparation for later actions.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique is not directly related to the described sequence. It involves discovering containers and resources, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique aligns well with the search for computer objects in the Active Directory database. It fits the step where the attackers are gathering information about remote systems.
- **C: T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking threads, which is not directly related to the described sequence. It is more about manipulating processes, which comes later in the sequence.
- **D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which is not part of the discovery phase and comes after the lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers profiled the computer (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but implied).
2. They searched for computer objects in the Active Directory database (T1018-Remote System Discovery).
3. They executed commands and performed process injection on remote computers for lateral movement (not directly related to the discovery phase but comes after the search).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred after the search for computer objects in the Active Directory database and before the execution of commands and process injection is T1018-Remote System Discovery.

### Final Answer: B
