Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Discovery is performed using in-memory execution tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit.
2. TG1021 then establishes command and control by deploying an inline hook on an IIS request validation function.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Discovery**: T1012-Query Registry, T1057-Process Discovery
- **Persistence**: T1505.004-IIS Components

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager**
  - This technique involves stealing or using credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. It does not directly relate to the discovery phase or the establishment of command and control via an IIS hook.

- **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly fit the sequence of discovery and command and control establishment.

- **C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. It is more related to gaining access and maintaining persistence, but it does not directly fit the sequence of discovery and command and control establishment via an IIS hook.

- **D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, such as Kerberos tickets or NTLM hashes, to gain access. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly fit the sequence of discovery and command and control establishment via an IIS hook.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Discovery using in-memory execution tools (T1012-Query Registry, T1057-Process Discovery).
2. Establishing command and control by deploying an inline hook on an IIS request validation function (T1505.004-IIS Components).

None of the provided answer choices directly fit the sequence described in the question. However, if we must choose the closest fit, **T1505.004-IIS Components** (Persistence) is the most relevant to the command and control establishment via an IIS hook.

Final Answer: D
