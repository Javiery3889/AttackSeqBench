To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group conducted lateral movement using harvested credentials and Windows built-in tools, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a sequence of TTPs that likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group conducted lateral movement using harvested credentials and Windows built-in tools. This implies that the techniques in question should be preparatory steps that enable the lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network.
- **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to facilitate lateral movement.
- **Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems.
- **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves discovering domain trusts, which is a preparatory step for lateral movement but not directly related to harvesting credentials.
- **B: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves discovering accounts, which could be a preparatory step for harvesting credentials but does not directly involve the use of harvested credentials.
- **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which could be a preparatory step for harvesting credentials but does not directly involve the use of harvested credentials.
- **D: T1110.001-Password Guessing**: This technique involves guessing passwords, which is a direct method of harvesting credentials that can be used for lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1110.001-Password Guessing** (D) is the most direct and relevant technique for harvesting credentials. Once the credentials are harvested, they can be used for lateral movement.
- The other techniques (T1482, T1087, and T1589) are preparatory steps that might lead to credential harvesting but do not directly involve the use of harvested credentials.

### Final Answer: D
