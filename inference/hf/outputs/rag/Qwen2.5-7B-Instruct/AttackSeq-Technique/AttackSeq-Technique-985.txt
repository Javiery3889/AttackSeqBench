### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the InfoOS module gathers system information, and the RemoteShell module lists installed applications and iPhone backups for Discovery.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next in the sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactics are "Discovery" and the techniques are "System Information Discovery" (T1082) and "Software Discovery" (T1518).
   - These techniques are part of the broader "Discovery" tactic, which involves the adversary learning about the environment to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves the use of a proxy to route network traffic. It is not directly related to the discovery of system or software information.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and listing running processes on a system. Given that the question mentions listing installed applications and iPhone backups, it is plausible that the next step would be to discover running processes, as this would provide more context about the system's current state.
   - **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input from graphical user interfaces. It is not directly related to the discovery of system or software information.
   - **D: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to analyze it. While it can provide information about the network, it is not the most direct follow-up to the discovery of installed applications and iPhone backups.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to discover running processes next, as it provides additional context about the system's current state after discovering installed applications and iPhone backups.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
