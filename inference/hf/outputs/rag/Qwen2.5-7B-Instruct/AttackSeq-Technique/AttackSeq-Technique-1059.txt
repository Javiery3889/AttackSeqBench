Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Darkhotel APT group:
1. Conducting reconnaissance to identify targets.
2. Utilizing Apache web servers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for infrastructure.
3. Conducting large-scale cryptographic operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Reconnaissance**: T1589.001-Credentials
- **Resource Development**: T1586.002-Email Accounts
- **Command and Control**: T1568-Dynamic Resolution

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
- This technique involves acquiring and establishing infrastructure for the attacker's use.
- It aligns with the use of Apache web servers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for leveraging their infrastructure.

**B: T1584.008-Network Devices**
- This technique involves the use of network devices for command and control.
- While it could be relevant, it does not directly align with the use of web servers and webapps.

**C: T1056-Input Capture**
- This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the use of web servers and webapps for infrastructure.

**D: T1608.006-SEO Poisoning**
- This technique involves manipulating search engine results to direct traffic to malicious sites.
- It is not directly related to the use of web servers and webapps for infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the use of Apache web servers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps, which are all related to establishing and leveraging infrastructure.
- The related TTPs mention acquiring infrastructure (T1583-Acquire Infrastructure) and dynamic resolution (T1568-Dynamic Resolution), which align with the use of web servers and dynamic DNS.
- The reconnaissance and resource development techniques (T1589.001-Credentials and T1586.002-Email Accounts) are also relevant but do not directly align with the infrastructure establishment.

**Final Answer: A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
