Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A malicious Excel file gains initial access.
2. Macros are enabled to construct a PE file.
3. Gholee malware employs `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe /C` for process execution while hiding its activity.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
  - This technique involves the use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute code. While it is related to execution, it does not directly fit the sequence described in the question, which involves a PE file and `ShellExecute`.

- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. It is more aligned with the use of `cmd.exe /C` and `ShellExecute`, which are command-line tools. This technique could be a plausible fit for the step where Gholee malware uses `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe /C`.

- **C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**
  - This technique involves using a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to host malicious content or services. It does not directly fit the sequence described in the question, which focuses on the execution of a PE file and the use of `ShellExecute`.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or control a system. It does not directly fit the sequence described in the question, which focuses on the execution of a PE file and the use of `ShellExecute`.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves the execution of a PE file and the use of `cmd.exe /C` and `ShellExecute` to hide the activity of Gholee malware.
- Among the given choices, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (B) is the most relevant because it directly involves the use of a command-line interpreter (`cmd.exe /C`) and `ShellExecute`, which are key components of the described sequence.

### Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
