### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malicious payloads (SodaMaster) are delivered using DESLoader through DLL side-loading.
   - The next step in the sequence is to maintain a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" and "Defense Evasion" tactics, with the specific technique being "DLL Side-Loading" (T1574.002).
   - DLL Side-Loading is a technique used to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate application, which is a method of persistence and evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
     - This technique is related to credential management and does not directly relate to maintaining a foothold through scheduled execution.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a specific executable at a specified time. This aligns well with the requirement to execute legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the need to execute files at regular intervals.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account**
     - This technique involves creating new user accounts, which is not directly related to the execution of files at regular intervals.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the requirement to execute legitimate executable files every 15 minutes is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.

**Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
