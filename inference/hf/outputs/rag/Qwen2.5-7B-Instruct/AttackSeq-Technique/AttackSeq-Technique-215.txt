Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Elirks malware is used to establish contact with a C2 server.
2. The malware accesses pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services.
3. The initial access was achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
  - This technique is related to authentication mechanisms and does not fit the context of initial access via spear-phishing emails.

- **Answer Choice B: T1087.003-Email Account**
  - This technique involves using email accounts, which could be part of a spear-phishing campaign. However, it does not directly describe the use of pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services.

- **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using web services, which could be part of the C2 server communication. However, it does not directly describe the initial access via spear-phishing emails.

- **Answer Choice D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
  - This technique involves using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of domain names for C2 servers. While it is related to C2 server communication, it does not directly describe the initial access via spear-phishing emails.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the initial access achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails. The technique that best fits this context is T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which is a sub-technique of T1566-Phishing.

However, none of the provided answer choices directly match T1566.002-Spearphishing Link. The closest match in the provided choices is T1087.003-Email Account, which is related to the use of email accounts, a common vector for spear-phishing.

### Final Answer: B: T1087.003-Email Account
