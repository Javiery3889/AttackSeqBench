Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malware establishes persistence by dropping the 'intel.wll' file into the Word startup folder.
2. An action occurs before communication with a C&C server to extend the infection chain by receiving additional functionality.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique is already mentioned in the question, as the malware establishes persistence by dropping the 'intel.wll' file into the Word startup folder.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This technique involves adding malicious add-ins to applications, which can be used to extend the infection chain.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question. The question asks for the technique that occurs before the communication with a C&C server to extend the infection chain.

- **A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique is not relevant to the context of the question, as it pertains to container orchestration, which is not mentioned or implied in the question.
- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it could be a part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly extend the infection chain.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to extend the infection chain. It is a plausible candidate as it directly relates to extending the infection chain.
- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This is the same as C, so it is also a plausible candidate.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence through the Word startup folder, which is already established.
- The next step before communication with a C&C server to extend the infection chain is likely to involve a technique that directly extends the infection chain.
- Both C and D (T1129-Shared Modules) are plausible as they directly extend the infection chain by using shared libraries or modules.

Given the context and the need to extend the infection chain, the most direct and relevant technique is T1129-Shared Modules.

### Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules
