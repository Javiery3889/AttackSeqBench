Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Establishing C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike.
2. Exfiltrating staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols, which aligns with the HTTPS encapsulation mentioned.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the C2 channel for data exfiltration, which aligns with the exfiltration of staged data using the C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves maintaining a two-way communication channel, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
- **Answer Choice B: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
  - This technique involves obtaining additional credentials for cloud services, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
- **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication, which aligns with the HTTPS encapsulation mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly address the exfiltration of data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes establishing a C2 channel and then exfiltrating data using that channel.
- The related TTPs mention T1572-Protocol Tunneling for C2 and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel for data exfiltration.
- Among the answer choices, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most relevant and directly addresses the exfiltration of data using the established C2 channel.

### Final Answer: D
