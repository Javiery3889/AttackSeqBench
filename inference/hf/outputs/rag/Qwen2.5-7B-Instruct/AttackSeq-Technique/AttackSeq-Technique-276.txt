Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Bandook campaign uses URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker.
2. After the redirection, PowerShell scripts are executed to drop additional files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.005-Link Target**: This technique involves the creation of malicious links, which aligns with the use of URL shortening services.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the execution of PowerShell scripts.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves the use of spearphishing to gain initial access, which could be a precursor to the URL redirection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into a legitimate web page. While it is a valid TTP, it does not directly align with the sequence of URL redirection and PowerShell execution.
- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. It is not directly related to the initial redirection and execution steps.
- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves the use of external remote services, which could include URL shortening services. This aligns well with the initial redirection step.
- **D: T1584.005-Botnet**: This technique involves the use of a botnet to distribute malware. While it is a valid TTP, it is not directly related to the initial redirection and execution steps.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence starting with URL redirection, which is most likely to be a part of the initial access phase.
- The related TTPs mention the use of external remote services (T1133) for link targets, which aligns with the use of URL shortening services.
- The execution of PowerShell scripts to drop additional files is a part of the execution phase.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of external remote services (URL shortening) to gain initial access, followed by the execution of PowerShell scripts.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
