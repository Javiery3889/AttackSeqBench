### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first uses process hollowing for defense evasion and then evades detection while executing the second-stage payload.
   - The final step in the sequence is the malware collecting information about active processes on the infected host.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" and specifically "Process Hollowing" (T1055.012-Process Hollowing).
   - Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is replaced with a malicious one to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions**
     - This technique is related to gaining additional permissions through email, which does not align with the context of collecting information about active processes.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate, which is not directly related to the collection of information about active processes.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry, which could be used to gather information about the system, but it is not the most direct or relevant technique for the context of the question.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and listing processes running on a system. Given that the malware has already used process hollowing and is now collecting information about active processes, this technique directly aligns with the final step in the sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery
