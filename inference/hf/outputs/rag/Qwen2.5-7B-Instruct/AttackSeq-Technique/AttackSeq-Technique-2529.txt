Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Emails are collected by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin.
2. The collected emails are forwarded to an attacker-controlled email address.
3. The data is exfiltrated by automating the process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1114-Email Collection
- T1114.001-Local Email Collection
- T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting emails, which aligns with the first part of the sequence.
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This is a sub-technique of T1114, focusing on collecting emails locally.
- **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up a rule to forward emails to another address, which aligns with the second part of the sequence.

### Step 4: Determine the Sequence
The sequence described in the question involves:
1. Collecting emails (T1114 or T1114.001 or T1114.003).
2. Forwarding the collected emails to an attacker-controlled email address (T1114.003).
3. Exfiltrating the data by automating the process (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).

### Step 5: Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule (for forwarding emails)
- T1020-Automated Exfiltration (for automating the exfiltration process)

However, the question asks for a single answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence. Given the options provided, the closest match to the sequence described is:

Final Answer: B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
