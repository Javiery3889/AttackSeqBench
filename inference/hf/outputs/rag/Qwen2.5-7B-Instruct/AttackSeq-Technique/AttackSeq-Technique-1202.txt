Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Energetic Bear gained initial access to Turkish critical infrastructure through a watering hole attack by compromising a supply chain website. This implies that the technique in question should be an initial access technique that precedes the supply chain compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware to the target.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to the target through a drive-by download.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique is about compromising a third-party system to deliver malware. However, the question asks for a technique that occurred before the supply chain compromise, which means it should be an initial access technique that leads to the supply chain compromise.
- **Option B: T1187-Forced Authentication**: This technique involves manipulating authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the supply chain compromise or drive-by compromise.
- **Option C: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**: This technique involves using LNK files to deliver malware. It is not directly related to the supply chain compromise or drive-by compromise.
- **Option D: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. It is more specific and does not fit the broader context of a watering hole attack through a supply chain website.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question specifies that the technique should be an initial access technique.
2. **Supply Chain Compromise**: The technique should lead to the supply chain compromise.
3. **Drive-by Compromise**: The related TTPs mention T1189-Drive-by Compromise, which is a plausible initial access technique that can lead to a supply chain compromise.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access technique was a drive-by compromise, which then led to the supply chain compromise.

Final Answer: B
