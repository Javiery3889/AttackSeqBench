Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Modular malware with partial AES-256 encryption and fileless execution techniques were used.
2. GreyEnergy operators then used only selected modules on specific targets for increased stealth.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This TTP involves exploiting remote services, which is not directly related to the use of modular malware, AES-256 encryption, or fileless execution techniques.

- **Answer Choice B: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**
  - This TTP involves using LNK files to smuggle icons, which is not directly related to the use of modular malware, AES-256 encryption, or fileless execution techniques.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
  - This TTP involves using web protocols for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This TTP involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. The use of fileless execution techniques and the encryption of data (T1486) are both methods to hide and protect the malware, aligning well with the T1564 technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions modular malware with partial AES-256 encryption and fileless execution techniques, which are all methods to hide and protect the malware.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File, further support the use of encryption to hide and protect the malware.
- The T1564-Hide Artifacts technique directly aligns with the use of fileless execution and encryption to hide the malware's presence and actions.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
