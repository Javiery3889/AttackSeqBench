### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Regin utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection. This indicates a technique that involves hiding data in non-standard locations to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique involves storing data in non-traditional file storage areas, which aligns with the question's description of encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using resource forks in files to store additional data, which is another method of hiding data in non-traditional file storage areas.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make them harder to detect, but it does not specifically mention non-traditional file storage areas.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process, which is not directly related to hiding data in non-traditional file storage areas.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not related to hiding data in non-traditional file storage areas.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute malicious code, which is not directly related to hiding data in non-traditional file storage areas.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is T1027.011-Fileless Storage, as it directly involves storing data in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (Note: The correct choice should be T1027.011-Fileless Storage, but the provided answer choices do not include the exact TTP name. The closest match is A, which is a broader category that could encompass the specific technique.)
