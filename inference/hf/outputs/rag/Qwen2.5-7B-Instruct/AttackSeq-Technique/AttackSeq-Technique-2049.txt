Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after harvesting corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections, the next step is to facilitate movement within the target's networks. This implies that the harvested credentials are being used to gain access to the target's network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using a service to craft and send spearphishing emails. While this is related to the initial harvesting of credentials, it does not directly facilitate network movement.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a network. This is a direct step after having harvested credentials.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves using email accounts to gather additional information or to facilitate further attacks. While it is related to the use of harvested credentials, it does not directly facilitate network movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is more about reconnaissance and does not directly facilitate network movement.
- **Answer Choice B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material, which could be relevant if the harvested credentials are not sufficient, but it does not directly facilitate network movement.
- **Answer Choice C: T1547.015-Login Items**: This technique involves using login items to facilitate access, which could be relevant if the harvested credentials are stored in login items, but it does not directly facilitate network movement.
- **Answer Choice D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malware or other tools, which could be relevant if the goal is to facilitate network movement, but it does not directly use the harvested credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The harvested credentials are used to gain access to the target's network, which is directly facilitated by the use of valid accounts (T1078-Valid Accounts).
- The harvested credentials are the means to gain access, and the next step is to use these credentials to move within the network.

**Final Answer: B (T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material)**

While the most direct technique for network movement is T1078-Valid Accounts, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after harvesting the credentials. The use of alternate authentication material (T1550) is a plausible step to ensure the harvested credentials are used effectively for network movement.
