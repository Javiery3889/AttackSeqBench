### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use `CertUtil.exe` disguised as `GoogleUpdate.exe` to download additional payloads.
   - The key point is that this action is part of evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves attackers using legitimate-looking files or processes to hide malicious activity.
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This sub-technique is a specific method of masquerading where the attackers ensure the file name or location matches a legitimate file or process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute code. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly address the disguise of `CertUtil.exe` as `GoogleUpdate.exe`.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique directly addresses the disguise of one file as another, which is exactly what the question describes.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering defensive indicators, which is not directly related to the disguise of files.
   - **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection:** This technique involves modifying security identifier (SID) history to evade detection, which is not directly related to the disguise of files.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **B: T1036-Masquerading**.

Final Answer: B
