Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. NanHaiShu establishes persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.
2. It gathers specific system details from the infected machine.
3. It communicates with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the registry to gather information.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering system information.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves modifying registry keys to ensure persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding infrastructure, which does not align with the question's focus on gathering system details.
- **Answer Choice B: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique is about discovering domain trust relationships, which is not relevant to the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring persistence, which is already covered by the question's mention of modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.
- **Answer Choice D: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique directly aligns with the question's requirement to gather specific system details from the infected machine.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that after persistence is established and before communication with C&C servers, the system details are gathered.
- The related TTPs mention T1082-System Information Discovery, which is specifically about gathering system information.
- The other answer choices do not fit the context of the question as well as T1082-System Information Discovery.

### Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery
