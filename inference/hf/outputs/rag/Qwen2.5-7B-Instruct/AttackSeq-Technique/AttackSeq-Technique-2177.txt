Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spoofing Taiwanese government email addresses.
2. Sending socially engineered emails.
3. Execution of malicious documents.
4. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications for initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.

- **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is not relevant to the initial access phase described in the question.

- **C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**
  - This technique involves reopening applications to maintain persistence or access. It is not directly related to the initial access phase described in the question.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malicious content. The related TTP T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment specifically mentions using attachments in spearphishing emails, which aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence starting with spoofing email addresses and sending socially engineered emails.
2. The related TTPs mention spearphishing, which fits the description of sending socially engineered emails with malicious documents.
3. T1566-Phishing (and specifically T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) aligns with the initial phase of the attack sequence.
4. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications for initial access (likely T1210.001-Exploitation of Remote Services) would follow the initial access phase.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T1566-Phishing occurred before the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications for initial access.

**Final Answer: D**
