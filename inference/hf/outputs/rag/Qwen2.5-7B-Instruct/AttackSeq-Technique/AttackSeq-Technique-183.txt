Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Infamous Chisel first uses its netd component to enumerate directories and perform IP scanning, and then scrapes files containing sensitive data and deploys tcpdump to sniff network interfaces.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved in the attack:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to discover information.
  - **Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration.
  - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the scraping of files and the deployment of tcpdump.

- **Option A: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique is about capturing network traffic, which is not directly related to scraping files or discovering sensitive data.
  
- **Option B: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique is not listed in the related TTPs, so it is not relevant to the context provided.

- **Option C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
  - This technique involves scanning IP blocks, which aligns with the IP scanning mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly involve scraping files or deploying tcpdump.

- **Option D: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - This technique involves accessing or stealing keychain data, which is not directly related to the scraping of files or deploying tcpdump.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where the first step involves scraping files containing sensitive data and deploying tcpdump to sniff network interfaces.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for file and directory discovery (T1083) and network sniffing (T1040).
- T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) is the most relevant technique as it directly involves scraping files, which is a precursor to deploying tcpdump for network sniffing.

### Final Answer: C
