Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. SBDH malware uses powerful filters for specifying exfiltration data based on attributes like file extension, creation date, and file size.
2. This is followed by the malware relying on multiple communication methods, including HTTP and SMTP, for Command and Control (C2).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for exfiltration.
- **Timestomp (T1070.006)**: This technique involves modifying the file timestamps to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**: This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to intercept and manipulate system calls. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration or C2 communication methods described in the question.

- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it is related to defense evasion, it does not directly fit the sequence of exfiltration and C2 communication.

- **C: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the exfiltration or C2 communication methods described.

- **D: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automating the collection of data, which aligns with the use of powerful filters for specifying exfiltration data based on attributes like file extension, creation date, and file size. This is a logical step before exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first uses powerful filters for specifying exfiltration data, and then relies on multiple communication methods for C2.
- **T1119-Automated Collection (D)** fits the first part of the sequence, as it involves automating the collection of data based on specific attributes.
- The next step in the sequence would be the use of multiple communication methods for C2, which is covered by the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) technique.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1119-Automated Collection (D)
2. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Therefore, the most plausible answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D**
