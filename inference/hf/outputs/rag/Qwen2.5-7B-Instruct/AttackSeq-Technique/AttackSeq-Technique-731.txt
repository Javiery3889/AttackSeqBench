Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the main component of a cyber attack has established communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules. The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique was used to hide the location of the 'mothership' server during the 'Red October' campaign.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context and additional techniques that might be relevant:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves making the attacker's presence appear legitimate by matching the name or location to something that would be expected.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This technique involves using network devices to support the attack, but it doesn't directly relate to hiding the location of the C&C server.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain command and control, but it doesn't directly address hiding the location of the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs and the question:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interpreters to execute commands. It doesn't directly relate to hiding the location of the C&C server.
- **B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop to exchange information. While it can be used for communication, it doesn't directly address hiding the location of the C&C server.
- **C: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can help in hiding the true origin of the traffic. This aligns well with the need to hide the location of the C&C server.
- **D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves using a Winlogon helper DLL to execute code in the context of the Windows logon process. It doesn't directly relate to hiding the location of the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** is a technique for making the attacker's presence appear legitimate, but it doesn't directly address hiding the location of the C&C server.
- **T1584.008-Network Devices** and **T1008-Fallback Channels** are related to maintaining command and control but don't directly address hiding the location.
- **T1090-Proxy** is the most relevant technique as it involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can help in hiding the true origin of the traffic, aligning with the need to hide the location of the C&C server.

### Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy
