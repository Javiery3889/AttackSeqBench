### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial phase where the Lazarus Group used system utilities to gather user and network information.
   - The next step in the sequence is to discover shared resources within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Discovery" as the tactic and specifically list "T1082-System Information Discovery" and "T1135-Network Share Discovery" as techniques.
   - "T1082-System Information Discovery" aligns with the initial phase of gathering user and network information.
   - "T1135-Network Share Discovery" is a technique that fits the next step of discovering shared resources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1021.005-VNC**
     - This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to remotely control a host. It does not directly relate to discovering shared resources.
   - **Option B: T1652-Device Driver Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering device drivers on a system. It is not directly related to discovering shared resources.
   - **Option C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
     - This technique directly involves discovering network shares, which aligns with the next step in the sequence after gathering system information.
   - **Option D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is already covered by the initial phase of the question.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gathering system information, the next step is to discover shared resources within the network. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1135-Network Share Discovery
