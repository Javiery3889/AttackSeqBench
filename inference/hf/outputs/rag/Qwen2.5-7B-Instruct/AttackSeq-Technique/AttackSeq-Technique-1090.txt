### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus Group used malicious macros for initial access to a pharmaceutical company's network.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to gather knowledge about the network for further exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique is related to the initial use of malicious macros.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique is also related to the initial access phase.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities** - This technique is related to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, which is a step that could follow gathering network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a connection. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly follow the initial access phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** - This technique directly aligns with the need to gather knowledge about the network for further exploitation. It is a logical step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL** - This technique involves using a password filter DLL to gain access to credentials. While it could be a step in the attack, it is more specific and does not directly follow the initial access phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases** - This technique involves searching for information in open technical databases. While it could be a step in the attack, it is more specific and does not directly follow the initial access phase.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access via malicious macros is to gather network information to understand the environment for further exploitation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
