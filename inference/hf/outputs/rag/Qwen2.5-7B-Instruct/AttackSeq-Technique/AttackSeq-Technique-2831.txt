### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlackSoul has already communicated with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and hosted its infrastructure on Cloudflare Workers Service.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols** (used in the question)
   - **Tactic: Resource Development**
     - **Technique: T1583.007-Serverless** (used in the question)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel. Given that the attack has already established a C2 channel using the RESTful Strapi protocol, it is plausible that the next step could be exfiltrating data over this channel.
   - **Option B: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**
     - This technique involves using the Netsh command to create a helper DLL for persistence. This does not directly relate to the established C2 channel or the use of Cloudflare Workers Service.
   - **Option C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information. This does not align with the established C2 channel and the use of Cloudflare Workers Service.
   - **Option D: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository. While this could be a plausible next step, it is less directly related to the established C2 channel and the use of Cloudflare Workers Service.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence, given the established C2 channel and the use of Cloudflare Workers Service, is the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
