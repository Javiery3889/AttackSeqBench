### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon's malware scanned all drives (local, removable, and network) to locate sensitive files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial scanning activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves accessing data from removable media, which aligns with the scanning of removable drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying files and directories, which is consistent with the initial scanning activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1199-Trusted Relationship:** This technique involves using a trusted relationship to gain access to a system or resource. It does not directly follow the scanning of drives for sensitive files.
   - **B: T1498.002-Reflection Amplification:** This technique involves amplifying the impact of a reflection attack, which is not directly related to the scanning of drives for sensitive files.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. While it involves network drives, it does not directly follow the scanning of all drives for sensitive files.
   - **D: T1074-Data Staged:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration or use, which logically follows the scanning of drives to locate sensitive files.

### Final Answer:
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the initial scanning activity, is that the malware would next prepare the data for exfiltration or use.
- **Final Answer: D: T1074-Data Staged**
