### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Dexphot, including the use of software bundlers, obfuscated batch scripts, and process hollowing.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the process hollowing technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are under the Tactic: Defense Evasion, and specifically mention T1055.012-Process Hollowing.
   - This indicates that the sequence of TTPs is part of a broader defense evasion strategy.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, and processes to avoid detection. It could plausibly occur before process hollowing to ensure the malicious process is not easily detected.
   - **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking COM objects to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described and does not seem to fit the context.
   - **C: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions. While it could be used in conjunction with process hollowing, it does not directly precede it in the sequence described.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. It is more likely to be used after the process has been hollowed and the malicious code is being executed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible technique that would occur before process hollowing is T1564-Hide Artifacts, as it would help in evading detection and ensuring the process hollowing technique is not easily noticed.
   
   **Final Answer: A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
