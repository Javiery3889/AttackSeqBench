Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a sequence of TTPs where A41APT used RDP for lateral movement. Before leveraging RDP, the question specifies that a technique facilitated the use of administrator accounts and tools for credential dumps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access to the target network.
- **Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts** - This technique involves the use of local accounts for persistence.
- **Tactic: Credential Access** - This tactic is about obtaining credentials.
- **Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping** - This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools across the network. It does not directly relate to the use of administrator accounts or credential dumps.
- **Answer Choice B: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution** - This technique involves executing system binaries through a proxy. It does not directly relate to the use of administrator accounts or credential dumps.
- **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, which could be relevant to credential dumping but does not directly specify the use of administrator accounts.
- **Answer Choice D: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** - This technique involves discovering domain trust relationships, which is more about understanding the network structure rather than directly facilitating credential dumping or the use of administrator accounts.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated the use of administrator accounts and tools for credential dumps is T1003-OS Credential Dumping, as it directly involves the dumping of credentials from the operating system.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** (Note: The correct answer based on the provided choices and context is C, but the most relevant technique for the described scenario is T1003-OS Credential Dumping, which is not listed in the choices provided.)
