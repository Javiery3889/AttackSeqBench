Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities for initial access.
2. Execution of commands and downloading additional payloads via a backdoor.
3. Persistence achieved using scheduled tasks and Registry RunKeys.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Persistence**: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique (A, B, C, or D) aligns with the execution of commands and downloading additional payloads via a backdoor.

- **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** - This technique involves the use of multiple channels to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to executing commands or downloading payloads.
- **B: T1053.002-At** - This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks. While it is related to scheduling tasks, it does not directly involve executing commands or downloading payloads.
- **C: T1087-Account Discovery** - This technique involves discovering valid accounts to use for lateral movement or privilege escalation. It does not directly involve executing commands or downloading payloads.
- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This directly aligns with the execution of commands and downloading additional payloads, which is a key part of the Phosphorus group's activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Phosphorus group's activities include exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access and then executing commands and downloading additional payloads.
- The technique that best fits this description is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, as it directly involves executing commands and downloading payloads.
- The other techniques (T1104, T1053.002, and T1087) do not directly align with the specific actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
