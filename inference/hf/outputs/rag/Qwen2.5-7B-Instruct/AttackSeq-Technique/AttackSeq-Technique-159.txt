### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first perform account discovery to identify local accounts on compromised systems.
   - The next step in the sequence is the lateral movement within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:** This technique involves identifying local accounts on systems.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to systems.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1021.005-VNC**
     - VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop protocol. It is not directly related to moving laterally within the network using local accounts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205.001-Port Knocking**
     - Port knocking is a method of remotely controlling access to a service by sending a series of packets to specific ports. It is not directly related to moving laterally within the network using local accounts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, which could be relevant to moving laterally but is not specifically tied to the use of local accounts.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves impairing or degrading the effectiveness of defensive measures. While it can be a part of an attacker's strategy, it does not directly describe the process of moving laterally using local accounts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of identifying local accounts and moving laterally, is the use of local accounts to gain access to other systems.
   - **Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** (Although this is not a perfect match, it is the closest to the context of using local accounts for lateral movement, as the other options do not directly relate to the use of local accounts for lateral movement.)

However, based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the context provided, the most direct and relevant technique for moving laterally using local accounts would be a technique that directly involves the use of local accounts for this purpose. Given the options, the closest match is:

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
