Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a threat actor has established persistence by setting a registry key to ensure the backdoor execution during user logon. The key mentioned is:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** - This is not directly relevant to the persistence technique described.
- **Tactic: Persistence**:
  - **Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** - This technique involves adding entries to the Windows Registry to ensure that a program runs automatically when a user logs on.
  - **Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves adding entries to the Windows Registry or other autostart locations to ensure that a program runs when the system boots or a user logs on.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique directly aligns with the scenario described in the question, as it involves adding entries to ensure a program runs during user logon.
- **Answer Choice B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
  - This technique involves modifying shared content to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to the registry key mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud logs to cover tracks. It is not relevant to the persistence technique described.
- **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the persistence technique described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where a threat actor has established persistence by setting a registry key to ensure the backdoor execution during user logon.
- The related TTPs mention the technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is closely related to the scenario.
- The technique T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is also relevant and directly aligns with the described scenario.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

### Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
