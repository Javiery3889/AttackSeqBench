Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) is used to execute commands and capture user activities.
2. The next step involves the use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront for command and control activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1090-Proxy
- T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
- T1102-Web Service

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to web protocols, it does not directly align with the use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront.

- **B: T1546.005-Trap**
  - This technique involves setting up a trap to lure the adversary into a false sense of security. It does not fit the context of using Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront for command and control.

- **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves archiving data that has been collected. It does not fit the context of command and control activities.

- **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
  - This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control. Given that the question mentions the use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront, this technique is highly relevant as both Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront are web-based services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) to execute commands and capture user activities.
- The next step involves using Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront for command and control activities.
- Among the given answer choices, T1071.001-Web Protocols (D) is the most relevant as it aligns with the use of web-based services for command and control.

### Final Answer: D
