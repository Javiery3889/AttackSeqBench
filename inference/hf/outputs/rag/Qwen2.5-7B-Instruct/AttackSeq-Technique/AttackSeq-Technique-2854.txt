### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where PowerShell scripts are used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document.
   - The next step in the sequence is to hinder analysis by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery** - This is not directly relevant to the next step in the sequence.
   - **Tactic: Execution** - This is relevant as it involves the use of PowerShell, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is the most relevant as it involves techniques to evade detection and analysis.
   - **Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is specifically about evading detection by virtual machines and sandboxes, which aligns with the question's requirement to hinder analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server** - This technique is about using a virtual private server, which is not directly related to evading detection.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection, but it does not specifically mention evading virtual machines or anti-virus software.
   - **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation** - This technique involves manipulating access tokens, which is not directly related to evading detection.
   - **D: T1562-Impair Defenses** - This technique involves impairing or degrading the effectiveness of defensive measures, which could include evading detection by virtual machines and anti-virus software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described and the related TTPs, is **T1562-Impair Defenses**. This technique aligns with the requirement to hinder analysis by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software.

**Final Answer: D: T1562-Impair Defenses**
