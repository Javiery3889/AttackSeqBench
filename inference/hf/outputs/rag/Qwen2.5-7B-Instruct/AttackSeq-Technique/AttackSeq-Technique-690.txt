Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Pierogi backdoor achieves persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.
2. An action occurs after persistence but before collecting information about the infected machine.
3. The collected information includes the computer name and antivirus details.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to achieve persistence.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding entries to the registry or startup folder to achieve persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the persistence technique (adding a shortcut to the startup folder) and precedes the collection of information about the infected machine.

- **A: T1587.004-Exploits**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to persistence or information collection.
- **B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**: This technique involves impairing the logging of commands. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to persistence or information collection.
- **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves impairing defenses, which could be a step after persistence but before information collection. However, it is more general and does not specifically fit the context of the question.
- **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or applications in a way that a user would expect. This could be a plausible step after persistence and before information collection, as it might involve the execution of a script or tool that gathers information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the backdoor achieving persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder, which aligns with **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**.
- The next step should be an action that prepares for or facilitates the collection of information, which aligns with **T1204-User Execution**. This technique could involve the execution of a script or tool that gathers the required information (computer name and antivirus details).

### Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
