### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes APT10 conducting internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - The actor then moves between Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and victims within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactics of "Discovery" and specific techniques such as "Remote System Discovery" (T1018) and "Network Service Discovery" (T1046).
   - These techniques are part of the "Discovery" tactic, which involves gathering information to understand the network and its components.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. It does not directly relate to the internal reconnaissance and movement between networks.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which is not directly related to the reconnaissance and movement described.
   - **C: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to execute malicious code. It is more about persistence and execution rather than reconnaissance and movement.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the primary one used by the organization. While it is related to data exfiltration, it does not directly address the internal reconnaissance and movement between networks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of internal reconnaissance and movement between networks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the discovery of network services and systems.
   - The related TTPs mention "Remote System Discovery" (T1018) and "Network Service Discovery" (T1046), which are directly related to the reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer: T1018-Remote System Discovery
