### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first evade detection by bypassing process-level restrictions and then inject malicious code into trusted processes using the AtomBombing technique.
   - The final step involves executing malicious code by leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call** - This technique is related to process injection and asynchronous procedure calls, but it does not directly involve atom tables.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection** - This technique is directly related to the process injection step, but it does not specify the use of atom tables.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053.003-Cron** - This technique is not directly related to the use of atom tables or process injection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking** - This technique is not related to the Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves using native Windows APIs, which can be used to interact with atom tables. This aligns well with the use of Windows operating system mechanisms.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055-Process Injection** - While this technique is related to process injection, it does not specify the use of atom tables.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is **C: T1106-Native API**. This technique involves using native Windows APIs, which can be used to interact with atom tables, aligning with the final step of executing malicious code by leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables.

**Final Answer: C: T1106-Native API**
