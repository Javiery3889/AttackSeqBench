### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where ChChes gains initial access through phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing disguised executable files.
   - The next step in the sequence is the malware communicating with its C&C servers using encrypted methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Attachment."
   - Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001) is a technique where attackers use malicious attachments in emails to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection. It is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
   - **B: T1218.012-Verclsid**
     - This technique involves using the Verclsid method to bypass security controls. It is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C&C server. It is relevant to the step after initial access but not to the initial access itself.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain or maintain access. It is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the malware began communicating with its C&C servers using encrypted methods. Given the context of initial access via spearphishing, the most relevant technique is the one that directly pertains to the initial access step.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** is the technique that describes the initial access via malicious attachments in emails.

### Final Answer: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is not directly listed in the answer choices, but the technique that aligns with the initial access via spearphishing is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. However, since the question asks for the answer choice and none of the provided options match T1566.001, the closest relevant technique in the provided list is not present. If forced to choose, the closest related technique would be **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**, as it is the next step in the sequence after initial access.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
