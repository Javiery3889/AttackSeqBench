Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A backdoor was deployed using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
2. An installer checked for VM execution.
3. A backdoor DLL was dropped.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context and additional techniques that are relevant to the question:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is a duplicate of the persistence technique mentioned above.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

- **A: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using at to schedule tasks. It does not align well with the context of deploying a backdoor or maintaining persistence.
- **B: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves using containers to deploy malware. It does not align well with the context of deploying a backdoor or maintaining persistence.
- **C: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves creating or modifying system services to maintain persistence. This aligns well with the context of deploying a backdoor and maintaining persistence.
- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. While this is a valid technique, it is more about hiding the backdoor rather than deploying or maintaining it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of deploying a backdoor and checking for VM execution.
- The next logical step would be to ensure the backdoor remains persistent.
- Among the given choices, T1569-System Services (C) is the most relevant technique for maintaining persistence after deploying a backdoor.

### Final Answer: C
