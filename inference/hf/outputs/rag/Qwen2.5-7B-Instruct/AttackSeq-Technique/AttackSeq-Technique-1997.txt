### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where SkinnyBoy exfiltrates data using a POST request with a specific structured format to a C2 server.
   - After exfiltration, the next step is to enumerate files and directories across the targeted system, including Desktop and user-specific folders.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Discovery" and the technique is "T1083-File and Directory Discovery."
   - This suggests that the next step in the attack sequence is to discover files and directories, which aligns with the question's requirement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
     - This technique involves intercepting paths that are not quoted, which is not directly related to enumerating files and directories.
   - **B: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering peripheral devices, which is not relevant to the task of enumerating files and directories.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique directly matches the requirement of enumerating files and directories, which is exactly what the question is asking for.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting data automatically, but it does not specifically mention enumerating files and directories.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly matches the requirement of enumerating files and directories, which is provided by T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
