### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before 'Surtr' connects to a command and control server (C2) and downloads a stage two component to a specific directory.
   - The key elements are:
     - 'Surtr' connecting to a C2 server.
     - Downloading a stage two component.
     - The component being placed in a specific directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves the use of multiple channels to exfiltrate data or deliver payloads. It is relevant to the multi-stage nature of the attack.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or payloads into the target environment. It is directly related to the downloading of a stage two component.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. While phishing can be a method to initially compromise a system, it does not directly relate to the downloading of a stage two component or the multi-stage nature of the attack.
   - **B: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the downloading of a stage two component or the multi-stage nature of the attack.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. While it can be used for C2 communication, it does not directly relate to the downloading of a stage two component or the multi-stage nature of the attack.
   - **D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique is directly related to the multi-stage nature of the attack, which aligns with the downloading of a stage two component. However, it does not directly address the initial step before the C2 connection.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique directly addresses the downloading of a stage two component, which is the immediate action before connecting to the C2 server.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the downloading of a stage two component, which aligns with the technique **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: D**
