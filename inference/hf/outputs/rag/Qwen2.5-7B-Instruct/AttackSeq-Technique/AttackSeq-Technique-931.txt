### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an Explosive Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords and then employs a Command and Control (C2) framework with multi-tiered servers.
   - We need to identify the TTP that logically follows keylogging and precedes the C2 framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the keylogging technique (T1056.001) is part of the Credential Access tactic.
   - The C2 framework (which involves multi-tiered servers) is part of the Lateral Movement tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves copying files to removable media, which is not directly related to the sequence of keylogging and C2 framework.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish C2. However, it does not directly follow keylogging and precede C2.
   - **C: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**
     - This technique involves spoofing the parent process ID to hide malicious processes. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it does not directly follow keylogging and precede C2.
   - **D: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold or maintain access. It is a common step after gaining credentials (through keylogging) and before setting up a C2 framework.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after keylogging to gain administrator passwords, the attackers would use a technique to establish a foothold or maintain access, which logically precedes setting up a C2 framework. Therefore, the best answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1021-Remote Services**
