Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions in a cyber attack:
1. VBA code within a Microsoft Word document decrypts data.
2. The decrypted data is dropped into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection**: This technique involves using templates to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the described sequence of actions.

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly follow the decryption and file dropping actions described in the question.
- **B: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the 'at' command to schedule tasks. It doesn't seem to fit the sequence of actions described.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It doesn't align with the sequence of actions described.
- **D: T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System**: This technique involves disabling or modifying the audit system on a Linux system. It doesn't fit the context of the question, which is focused on Windows-based actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the sequence of actions described in the question (decryption and file dropping), the most plausible TTP is one that directly follows these actions. The technique that best fits this sequence is T1059.005-Visual Basic, as it involves using VBA to execute code, which could be used to drop files after decryption.

Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (Note: The correct choice should be T1059.005-Visual Basic, but since it's not an option, the closest match is A, which is a broader category that could include VBA execution.)
