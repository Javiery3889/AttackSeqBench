### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: compressing files with WinRAR and uploading the archive to the Mega service for exfiltration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was used for communication with compromised systems to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves using utilities like WinRAR to compress files, which aligns with the first part of the sequence (compressing files with WinRAR).
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves using cloud storage services for exfiltration, which aligns with the second part of the sequence (uploading the archive to the Mega service).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection. While this could be a method to avoid detection, it is not directly related to the communication method used in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1137.002-Office Test**
     - This technique is not relevant to the context of the question, as it pertains to testing office environments, not communication methods.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the communication method used in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media for communication, which is not directly related to the sequence described (cloud storage).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the context of the question and the related TTPs, is the use of non-standard ports to avoid detection during communication with compromised systems.
   - **Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
