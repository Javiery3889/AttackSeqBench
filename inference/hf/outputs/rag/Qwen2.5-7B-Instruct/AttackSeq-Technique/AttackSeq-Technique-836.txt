Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Staging stolen data in the `%TEMP%` directory with AES encryption.
2. Initiating communications with a C2 server using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection**: T1074.001-Local Data Staging
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- **Command and Control**: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which TTP enables the initiation of communications with the C2 server using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556).

- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which aligns with the use of UDP 6999 or TCP 55556.
- **T1102.003-One-Way Communication**: This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel, which is not directly related to the use of non-standard ports.
- **T1037.005-Startup Items**: This technique involves using startup items to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to the use of non-standard ports.
- **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves discovering software on the system, which is not directly related to the use of non-standard ports.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes initiating communications with a C2 server using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556).
- The related TTPs mention the use of non-standard ports for command and control.
- T1571-Non-Standard Port is the most relevant TTP as it directly addresses the use of non-standard ports for communication.

### Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port
