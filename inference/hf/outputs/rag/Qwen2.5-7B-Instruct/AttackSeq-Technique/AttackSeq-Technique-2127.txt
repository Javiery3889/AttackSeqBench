### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where scanning tools and stolen credentials are used for discovery, followed by lateral movement via RDP to target servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Lateral Movement" and specifically "T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)" as a technique for achieving lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting email content from remote systems. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it does not directly align with the use of RDP for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. T1021.001 specifically mentions RDP, which aligns with the use of RDP for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services to establish a connection to a remote system. It does not align with the use of RDP for lateral movement.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the use of RDP for lateral movement, which is directly mentioned in T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol.

**Final Answer: C**
