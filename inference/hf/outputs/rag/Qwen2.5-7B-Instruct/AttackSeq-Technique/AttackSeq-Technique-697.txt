Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after downloading remote administration tools during the execution phase, the cybercriminals explored the financial systems of the targeted organization during the discovery phase. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique best fits this scenario.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves identifying remote systems that can be used to further the attack.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or commands with user-level privileges.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying software that can be used to further the attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1201-Password Policy Discovery**: This technique involves discovering password policies, which is more relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase rather than the discovery of financial systems.
- **Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, and registry entries to avoid detection. It is more relevant to the persistence phase rather than the discovery phase.
- **Option C: T1027.008-Stripped Payloads**: This technique involves modifying payloads to avoid detection. It is also more relevant to the delivery phase rather than the discovery phase.
- **Option D: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves identifying valid accounts that can be used to gain access to the network. It is relevant to the discovery phase as it involves identifying accounts that can be used to explore the financial systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the cybercriminals are exploring the financial systems of the targeted organization during the discovery phase.
- Among the given options, T1087-Account Discovery (Option D) is the most relevant because it directly involves identifying accounts that can be used to gain access and explore the financial systems.
- The other options are either more relevant to different phases of the attack (e.g., T1201-Password Policy Discovery, T1564-Hide Artifacts, T1027.008-Stripped Payloads) or do not directly align with the described scenario.

### Final Answer: D
