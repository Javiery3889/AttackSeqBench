Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Earth Wendigo steals username and password pairs via intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API. Before this, the technique used to evade detection involved indirect script execution through the webmail system's features.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves using a service to deliver a spearphishing attack.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making malicious artifacts appear to be benign or legitimate.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files to make them harder to detect. While it can be used for evasion, it does not directly involve script execution.
- **Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding malicious artifacts to evade detection. It is more about hiding than executing scripts.
- **Option C: T1491-Defacement**: This technique involves modifying or destroying web content. It does not align with the scenario of indirect script execution.
- **Option D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one used for normal communication. It does not align with the scenario of script execution.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique that involves indirect script execution through the webmail system's features is **T1036-Masquerading**. This technique allows the attacker to make malicious artifacts appear legitimate, which can be used to evade detection while executing scripts indirectly.

**Final Answer: C: T1036-Masquerading**
