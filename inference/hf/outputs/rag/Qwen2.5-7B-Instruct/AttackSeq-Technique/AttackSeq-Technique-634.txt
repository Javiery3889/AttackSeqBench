Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Persistence is achieved by saving `msupdateconf.exe` to the Startup folder.
2. Decoded shellcode contacts a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`.
3. The C&C server directs the download of additional shellcode.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
  - This technique is about maintaining access by modifying the registry or placing files in the Startup folder.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or data from a C&C server to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique is about encoding data to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the C&C communication or the download of additional shellcode.
- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Given the HTTPS protocol used in the question, this is a strong candidate.
- **Answer Choice C: T1588.001-Malware**
  - This is a general technique about malware, but it does not specifically address the C&C communication or the download of additional shellcode.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interpreters or scripting languages to execute commands. It does not directly relate to the C&C communication or the download of additional shellcode.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a C&C communication over HTTPS, which aligns with the use of an application layer protocol.
- The related TTPs mention T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, which involves transferring tools or data from a C&C server to the target system, consistent with the question's description of downloading additional shellcode.
- Among the given choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B) is the most relevant to the HTTPS communication and aligns with the C&C technique.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
