Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office documents leveraging the DDE protocol for initial access.
2. Gallmaker (a hypothetical actor) uses living off the land (LotL) tactics.
3. Gallmaker removes tools from victim machines to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique is relevant to the use of DDE in the malicious Office documents.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique is relevant to the spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically follows the initial access and execution techniques and precedes the removal of tools.

- **Answer Choice A: T1218.004-InstallUtil**: This technique involves using the `InstallUtil` tool to install a .NET assembly. It does not directly relate to the spear-phishing or DDE techniques and does not seem to fit the sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves forging web credentials, which is not directly related to the spear-phishing or DDE techniques and does not fit the sequence.
- **Answer Choice C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, which is not directly related to the spear-phishing or DDE techniques and does not fit the sequence.
- **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection, which logically follows the use of LotL tactics and removal of tools from victim machines.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with initial access via spear-phishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
- The next step is execution of the malicious payload using DDE (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange).
- After gaining initial access and executing the payload, the actor (Gallmaker) uses LotL tactics.
- To avoid detection, Gallmaker would need to remove any indicators of compromise, which aligns with the T1070-Indicator Removal technique.

### Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
