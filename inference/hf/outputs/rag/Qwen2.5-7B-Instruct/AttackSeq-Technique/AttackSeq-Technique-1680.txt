### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Cobalt Strike Beacon communicates with a C&C domain as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.
   - The attackers' end goal is significant disruption to the victim's IT infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Command and Control (C&C) tactic.
   - The techniques mentioned are:
     - T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver
     - T1071.004-DNS
     - T1008-Fallback Channels

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1547.015-Login Items (A):** This technique involves adding malicious login items to a user's system. While it can be disruptive, it is more about gaining persistence rather than direct disruption.
   - **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact (B):** This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable, which aligns well with the goal of significant disruption.
   - **T1485-Data Destruction (C):** This technique involves deleting or corrupting data, which also aligns with the goal of significant disruption.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping (D):** This technique involves stealing credentials, which can be used for further attacks but does not directly cause significant disruption.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both T1486 and T1485 are strong candidates as they directly cause significant disruption. However, T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact) is more likely to be the primary technique used in a ransomware attack like WastedLocker, as encryption is a common method to demand a ransom and cause disruption.
   - T1485 (Data Destruction) is also a strong candidate but is more destructive and less likely to be the primary technique in a ransomware scenario where the attackers aim to extort a ransom.

### Final Answer: B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact
