Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Infamous Chisel collects files from local system and application directories.
2. These files are then exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection**: T1005-Data from Local System
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- **Defense Evasion**: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to match the described sequence with the provided answer choices and related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A and B**: Both are identical and refer to "T1020-Automated Exfiltration". This technique is not directly related to the exfiltration method described (using Tor hidden service and SSH connections).
- **Answer Choice C**: T1614-System Location Discovery. This technique is not relevant to the exfiltration process.
- **Answer Choice D**: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood. This technique is not related to the exfiltration process either.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
The question describes a specific method of exfiltration using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. The most relevant TTP in the provided list is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which aligns with the described method of using a C2 channel (Tor hidden service and SSH connections).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (though not directly listed in the choices, the closest match in the provided choices would be a technique that aligns with C2 channel usage, which is not explicitly listed here).
