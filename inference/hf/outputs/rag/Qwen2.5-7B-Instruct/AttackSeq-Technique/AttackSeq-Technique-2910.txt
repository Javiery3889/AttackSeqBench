Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials. After obtaining these credentials, the next step was to install the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistence. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique likely occurred after obtaining these credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain access to the network.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync**: This technique involves using DCSync to obtain user credentials from Active Directory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which is not directly related to the credential access or persistence techniques mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it is related to credential access, it is not specifically about the next step after obtaining domain administrator credentials.
- **Answer Choice C: T1546.008-Accessibility Features**: This technique involves using accessibility features to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to the credential access or persistence techniques mentioned.
- **Answer Choice D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves forging web credentials, which is not directly related to the credential access or persistence techniques mentioned.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials (T1003.006-DCSync).
2. After obtaining these credentials, the next step would be to use these valid accounts (T1078-Valid Accounts) to maintain access to the network.

However, the question specifically asks for the technique that likely occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials, and the most direct and relevant technique from the given choices is T1078-Valid Accounts.

**Final Answer: B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
