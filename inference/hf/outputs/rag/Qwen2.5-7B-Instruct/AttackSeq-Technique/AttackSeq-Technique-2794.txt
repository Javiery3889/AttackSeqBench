### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where XAgent app collects information from an iOS device and then uploads files via FTP to a C2 server.
   - The key technique here is the uploading of files via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP, etc.) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves executing code or applications on a system. It does not directly relate to uploading files via FTP.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS** - This technique involves rapidly changing the IP addresses associated with a domain name. It is not directly related to uploading files via FTP.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** - This technique involves using legitimate system or application features to perform actions that would otherwise require elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to uploading files via FTP.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools or malware into a network. While it is related to transferring tools, it does not specifically address the uploading of files via FTP.
   - **Answer Choice T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols** - This technique directly involves using file transfer protocols (FTP) for C2 communication, which aligns with the question's requirement of uploading files via FTP.
