### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of njRAT malware, special victim IDs, and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the exfiltration of the databases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
     - **T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using a USB device.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**
     - This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens or other authentication mechanisms. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into a web page or other application. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or mouse movements. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data. Given that the question mentions the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, this technique is the most plausible as it directly relates to the process of moving the data out of the infected device.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
