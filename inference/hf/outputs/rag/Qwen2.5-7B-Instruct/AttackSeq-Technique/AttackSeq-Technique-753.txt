### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the NewPass implant is executed using the dropper's 'LocalDataVer' function.
   - The next step in the sequence is the loader decoding the binary file and extracting the agent component for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Defense Evasion" and the techniques are:
     - T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
     - T1027.009-Embedded Payloads

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique directly aligns with the step where the loader decodes the binary file. It is a common method used by malware to evade detection by obfuscating the payload.
   - **T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding the payload within other files or data to avoid detection. However, it does not directly describe the process of decoding or extracting the agent component.
   - **T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft:** This technique is related to stealing or impersonating tokens, which is not directly related to the decoding or extraction process.
   - **T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking dynamic link libraries, which is not directly related to the decoding or extraction process described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the loader decodes the binary file and extracts the agent component for defense evasion, which aligns with the technique T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.

**Final Answer: D**
