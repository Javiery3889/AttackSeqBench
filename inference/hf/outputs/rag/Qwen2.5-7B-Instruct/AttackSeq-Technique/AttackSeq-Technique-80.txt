Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where OnionDog initially gains access through exploiting vulnerabilities in Hangul software and spreading through USB Worms. The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with the C&C server and downloading additional malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step where the adversary gains access to the target network.
- **Replication Through Removable Media (T1091):** This technique involves spreading malware through removable media like USB drives.
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This is the step where the adversary establishes communication with the C&C server.
- **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105):** This technique involves transferring tools or malware from an external source to the target network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before OnionDog established communication with its C&C server and downloaded additional malware.

- **A: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique is about establishing a connection across network boundaries, which is not directly related to the initial access or the spread through removable media.
- **B: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection, which is more related to the command and control phase.
- **C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries, which is more related to persistence or privilege escalation rather than initial access or spread.
- **D: T1505.002-Transport Agent:** This technique involves using a transport agent to move data or malware, which could be related to the spread through removable media (T1091).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Hangul software (not explicitly listed but implied).
- **Replication Through Removable Media (T1091):** Spreading through USB Worms.
- **Transport Agent (T1505.002):** This technique aligns with the spread through removable media, which is a plausible step before establishing communication with the C&C server.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before OnionDog established communication with its C&C server and downloaded additional malware is the spread through removable media, which is facilitated by the transport agent.

### Final Answer: D
