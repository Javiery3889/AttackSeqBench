Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) collect system and network information. After this, the malware infects connected removable media, which is part of the initial stage of the attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is already described in the question. This is a preparatory step but not the answer we are looking for.
- **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which aligns with the description of the malware infecting connected removable media.
- **T1200-Hardware Additions**: This technique involves adding hardware to the system, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data locally, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware first collects system and network information (T1082-System Information Discovery).
- After this, the malware infects connected removable media (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media).

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the malware collects system and network information, it infects connected removable media, which is a part of the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: B: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
