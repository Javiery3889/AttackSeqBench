Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malware achieves persistence using a RunOnce key in the registry.
2. An action occurs after persistence but before establishing command and control by injecting into a process through Process Hollowing.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is a general tactic that can encompass various techniques used to avoid detection.
- **Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing** - This is the technique used to establish command and control by injecting into a process.
- **Tactic: Persistence** - This tactic includes techniques for maintaining long-term access, such as T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify a TTP that logically follows persistence and precedes Process Hollowing.

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique is similar to T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is already mentioned in the question. It is not a subsequent step but rather a part of the initial persistence mechanism.
- **B: T1057-Process Discovery** - This technique involves discovering running processes, which could be a step after persistence but not necessarily before Process Hollowing.
- **C: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** - This technique involves discovering trust relationships within a domain, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **D: T1057-Process Discovery** - This is the same as option B, so it is not a plausible answer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the action occurs after persistence (using a RunOnce key) and before Process Hollowing.
- Process Discovery (T1057) is a logical step that could be taken to gather information about the system's processes, which might be necessary before performing Process Hollowing.
- Other options do not fit the sequence as well as T1057.

### Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery
