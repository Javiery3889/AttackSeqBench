### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading to the exfiltration of staged data as ".a" files from the %TEMP% directory to a C2 server.
   - The specific TTP of interest is the one that occurs after WinDealer discovers data about the infected PC and network configuration for further processing and categorization.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Collection" as the tactic and "T1074.001-Local Data Staging" as the technique.
   - T1074.001-Local Data Staging involves the process of collecting and staging data locally before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy** - This technique involves using an internal proxy to exfiltrate data. It does not fit the sequence as it is more about the exfiltration method rather than the data collection and staging.
   - **B: T1025-Data from Removable Media** - This technique involves using removable media to exfiltrate data. It does not fit the sequence as the data is being staged locally in the %TEMP% directory.
   - **C: T1115-Clipboard Data** - This technique involves using the clipboard to exfiltrate data. It does not fit the sequence as the data is being staged locally in the %TEMP% directory.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It does not fit the sequence as it is more about hiding the presence of the data rather than the collection and staging process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is the one that involves the collection and staging of data locally before exfiltration.
   - The technique T1074.001-Local Data Staging fits this sequence perfectly.

**Final Answer: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**
