### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where SBDH malware has downloaded a backdoor and a data stealer.
   - The goal is to determine which technique ensures the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Execution."
   - The technique mentioned is "T1204.002-Malicious File," which involves the use of a malicious file to execute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1137-Office Application Startup**
     - This technique involves modifying the startup settings of Office applications to ensure the malware runs when the application is launched.
     - This aligns well with the scenario of ensuring the malware runs when a Word document is opened or edited.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to a system.
     - This does not align with the scenario of ensuring the malware runs when a Word document is opened or edited.
   - **C: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute malicious code.
     - While this can be used to execute malware, it does not specifically address the scenario of ensuring the malware runs when a Word document is opened or edited.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting data automatically at regular intervals or based on certain conditions.
     - This does not align with the scenario of ensuring the malware runs when a Word document is opened or edited.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to ensure the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited is **T1137-Office Application Startup**.

Final Answer: A
