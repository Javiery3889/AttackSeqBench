Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where credentials are stolen through spearphishing emails and then transmitted to C2 servers. The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
  - **Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique is about gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to facilitating anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.
- **Answer Choice B: T1590.002-DNS**
  - DNS (Domain Name System) is a protocol used for translating domain names to IP addresses. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not specifically about facilitating anonymous communication.
- **Answer Choice C: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can help in anonymizing communication. Proxies can be used to mask the origin of the traffic, making it harder to trace back to the attacker.
- **Answer Choice D: T1205.001-Port Knocking**
  - Port knocking is a method of remotely controlling access to a service by sending a series of connection attempts to specific ports. It is not directly related to facilitating anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.
- The related TTPs mention web protocols (T1071.001) and exfiltration over C2 channels (T1041), which are not directly about anonymity.
- The technique that best fits the requirement of facilitating anonymous communication is T1090-Proxy, as it can be used to route traffic through a proxy, thereby anonymizing the communication.

### Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy
