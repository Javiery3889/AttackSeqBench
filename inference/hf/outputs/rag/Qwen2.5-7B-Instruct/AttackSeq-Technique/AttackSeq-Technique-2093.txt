Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have already moved laterally across the infrastructure and have compromised numerous workstations. They are now targeting internal hosts and servers to search for critical information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement** - This tactic is already completed, as the attackers have moved laterally.
- **Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools to other systems to maintain persistence or facilitate further lateral movement. However, the question states that the attackers are now searching for critical information, which suggests they have already established a foothold and are moving to the next phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking** - This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly align with the search for critical information.
- **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories** - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which aligns with the search for critical information. However, it doesn't directly follow the compromise of workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
- **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping** - This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which can be used to gain access to critical information. This aligns well with the scenario of searching for critical information after compromising workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
- **D: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing** - This technique involves spoofing DHCP to redirect traffic or gain access to network resources. While it can be part of an attack, it doesn't directly align with the search for critical information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already moved laterally and compromised numerous workstations.
- They are now targeting internal hosts and servers to search for critical information.
- Among the given options, **T1003-OS Credential Dumping** (C) is the most plausible technique because it directly aligns with the search for critical information after compromising workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

### Final Answer: C
