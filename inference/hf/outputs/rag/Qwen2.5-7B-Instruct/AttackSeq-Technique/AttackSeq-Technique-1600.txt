Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves FastPOS using keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information.
   - After these techniques, the stolen credit card information is immediately transmitted to the attacker.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely followed under the Collection tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Collection tactic and specifically mention T1056.001-Keylogging and T1005-Data from Local System.
   - T1056.001-Keylogging is already mentioned in the question, so we need to focus on T1005-Data from Local System.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery** - This technique is about discovering running processes, which is not directly related to the collection of stolen credit card information.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data** - This technique involves stealing data from the clipboard, which might be relevant but is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is not directly related to the stolen credit card information.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the keylogging and RAM scraping mentioned in the question. It is also part of the Collection tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question states that after keylogging and RAM scraping, the stolen credit card information is immediately transmitted to the attacker.
   - T1056.001-Keylogging is already mentioned, and T1056-Input Capture is a broader technique that includes keylogging.
   - T1005-Data from Local System is also part of the Collection tactic and is relevant to the context of collecting stolen information.
   - Among the given choices, T1056-Input Capture (D) is the most comprehensive and directly related to the keylogging and RAM scraping techniques mentioned.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
