Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Dragonfly attackers conducted reconnaissance using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain exploits.
2. They gathered information.
3. They leveraged spear-phishing emails to target energy companies for initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1589.002-Email Addresses**: This technique is related to reconnaissance and involves gathering email addresses.
- **T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique is also related to reconnaissance and involves using spear-phishing emails.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique is related to initial access and involves using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the reconnaissance phase and precedes the initial access phase.

- **A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**: This technique involves modifying firmware, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- **B: T1650-Acquire Access**: This technique involves gaining access to a system or network, which is more aligned with the initial access phase rather than the reconnaissance phase.
- **C: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves compromising cloud accounts, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but is not directly linked to the spear-phishing emails used for initial access.
- **D: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves actively scanning networks or systems, which is a common tactic used during the reconnaissance phase to gather information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attackers first conduct reconnaissance using various methods (spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain exploits).
- The next step is to gather information, which is a natural progression from reconnaissance.
- The final step is to use spear-phishing emails to target energy companies for initial access.

Given the context, the most plausible TTP that fits between reconnaissance and initial access is **T1595-Active Scanning**, as it directly relates to the reconnaissance phase and the gathering of information.

### Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning
