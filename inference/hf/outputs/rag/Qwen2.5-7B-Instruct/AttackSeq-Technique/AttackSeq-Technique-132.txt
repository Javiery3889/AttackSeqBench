### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT-TOCS uses "powershell.exe" in memory to execute Shellcode script functionalities without writing to the hard disk.
   - The sequence continues with multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows the use of PowerShell in memory and precedes multi-beacon communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Execution" as the tactic and "T1059.001-PowerShell" as the technique.
   - This indicates that the sequence involves the use of PowerShell for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059.006-Python**
     - This technique involves using Python for command and scripting interpretation. However, the question specifically mentions PowerShell, not Python.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter, which is a broad category. It could include PowerShell, but it is not specific to PowerShell in memory.
   - **C: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping disk structures, which is not relevant to the sequence described (no writing to the hard disk and then multi-beacon communication).
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. This could be a plausible step after executing PowerShell in memory and before multi-beacon communication, as it helps in evading detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using PowerShell in memory, the next step would be to encode the data to evade detection.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding"
