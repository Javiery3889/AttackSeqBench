Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where KiraV2 periodically receives commands from a C&C server to execute DDoS attacks. It also mentions that KiraV2 uses hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication with the C&C server. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before KiraV2 used these methods.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1071.001-Web Protocols
- T1071.004-DNS
- T1008-Fallback Channels

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
  - This technique is related to authentication and does not directly relate to the communication methods or fallback channels mentioned in the question.

- **B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
  - This technique is about establishing a one-way communication channel, which is not directly related to the use of hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers.

- **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it is related to encoding, it does not directly address the use of hard-coded IP addresses.

- **D: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**
  - This technique is about causing a denial of service on the endpoint. It does not directly relate to the communication methods or fallback channels.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve techniques that are directly related to establishing and maintaining communication with the C&C server. The technique that best fits this context is T1008-Fallback Channels, as it involves having alternative methods to communicate with the C&C server in case the primary method is detected or blocked.

However, none of the provided answer choices directly match T1008. The closest match in terms of encoding and fallback channels is **C: T1132-Data Encoding**, as it involves encoding data, which could be part of the fallback mechanism.

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
