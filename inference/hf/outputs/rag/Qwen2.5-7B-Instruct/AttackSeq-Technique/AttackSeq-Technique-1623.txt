Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT28 uses a pr.dll module to collect data from a target system. The next step involves communication with C&C servers that use HTTP on ports 443 or 80 for data transfer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is the overarching tactic that involves the adversary's actions to maintain control over the compromised system.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique specifically involves the use of web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control.
- **Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to web protocols, it is broader and does not specifically mention HTTP or HTTPS.
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not align with the described communication method.
- **C: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**: This technique involves using specific files for command and control, which is not relevant to the described HTTP-based communication.
- **D: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for command and control, which aligns well with the use of HTTP on ports 443 or 80 for data transfer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the communication uses HTTP on ports 443 or 80.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is specifically about using web protocols for command and control.
- Among the answer choices, T1102-Web Service (D) is the most specific and relevant to the described communication method.

### Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service
