### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the initial access phase to compromise external remote services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs list "Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services."
   - T1133-External Remote Services refers to the use of external remote services to establish a foothold or maintain access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging** - This technique involves modifying the memory of a process to make it appear as a legitimate process. It is not directly related to initial access or compromising external remote services.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts** - This technique involves using default or weak credentials to gain access. While it can be part of initial access, it does not directly relate to the use of external remote services.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading** - This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk. It is not directly related to initial access or compromising external remote services.
   - **D: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique directly aligns with the question's context of using external remote services to establish a foothold. It fits the scenario of using Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection and gain access to external remote services.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
