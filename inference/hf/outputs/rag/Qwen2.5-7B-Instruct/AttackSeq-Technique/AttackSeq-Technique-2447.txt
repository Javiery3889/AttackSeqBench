### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Elise malware establishes persistence by modifying the Run Registry key with the value name "IAStorD."
   - The next step in the sequence is the malware communicating with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique is relevant to the initial persistence step where the malware modifies the Run Registry key.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is also relevant to the persistence step, as it involves modifying the Run key to ensure the malware starts with the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness** - This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions on services. It is not directly related to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port** - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. While it could be a plausible technique for C2 communication, it is not the most direct or common method.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols for C2 communication. This is a common and effective method for malware to communicate with a C2 server without raising suspicion.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the malware communicating with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: D
