Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor has archived collected data in a custom storage file format. The next step in the sequence is to transfer this data from the victim's system. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely to be used for this data transfer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the attack sequence:
- **Collection**: T1005-Data from Local System
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- **Collection**: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using a USB drive. However, the question does not mention any USB device being used, and the related TTPs do not suggest this method.
  
- **B: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. It is not directly related to data exfiltration and does not fit the context of the question.
  
- **C: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
  - This technique involves modifying domain properties to evade detection. It is not related to data exfiltration and does not fit the context of the question.
  
- **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. The related TTPs mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which aligns with the context of the question where data is being transferred from the victim's system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the SombRAT backdoor archiving data in a custom format.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which is a common method for transferring data from a compromised system to the attacker's server.
- None of the other techniques (USB exfiltration, shared modules, or domain properties) are relevant to the context of data exfiltration over a C2 channel.

### Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
