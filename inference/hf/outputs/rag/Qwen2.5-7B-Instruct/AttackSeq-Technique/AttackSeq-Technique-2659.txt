### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where encrypted Korplug malware is executed using a custom loader.
   - The malware then collects metadata and content from mapped drives.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to collect system-specific temporal information before the latter actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two tactics: Impact and Discovery.
   - The techniques mentioned are T1485-Data Destruction and T1082-System Information Discovery.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery is relevant to the question as it involves gathering information about the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1087.001-Local Account** - This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts, which is not directly related to collecting system-specific temporal information.
   - **B: T1543-Create or Modify System Process** - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to collecting system-specific temporal information.
   - **C: T1552.003-Bash History** - This technique involves accessing or modifying the bash history, which is not directly related to collecting system-specific temporal information.
   - **D: T1124-System Time Discovery** - This technique involves discovering the system time, which is a form of system-specific temporal information.

### Final Answer:
- The technique that most likely serves to collect system-specific temporal information is T1124-System Time Discovery.
- **Final Answer: D: T1124-System Time Discovery**
