### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where OceanLotus ensures payload execution in memory by using DES-decrypted content from a URL to prevent detection.
   - The key elements are:
     - Payload execution in memory
     - DES-decrypted content from a URL
     - Prevention of detection

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1480.001-Environmental Keying:** This technique involves using environmental factors to control the execution of malware. It is relevant to the prevention of detection.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding to reveal the true nature of the content. It is relevant to the DES-decryption process.
   - **T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding payloads within other files or content. It is less directly relevant to the specific sequence described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique directly aligns with the DES-decryption of content from a URL. It is a necessary step before the payload can be executed.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page. It does not directly align with the specific sequence of DES-decryption and payload execution.
   - **C: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing security controls. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly align with the specific sequence of DES-decryption and payload execution.
   - **D: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection:** This technique involves injecting a portable executable into a process. While it is related to payload execution, it does not directly align with the specific sequence of DES-decryption.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the deobfuscation/decoding of the payload content. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
