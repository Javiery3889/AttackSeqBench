### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word documents with malicious macros and links to malicious sites.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - Specifically, the related TTPs are:
     - T1566-Phishing
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
     - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing (B):** This is a broad technique that encompasses various methods of phishing, including spear-phishing.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (C):** This technique specifically involves using links in phishing emails.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (D):** This technique involves using attachments in spear-phishing emails.
   - **T1218.013-Mavinject (A):** This technique is not directly related to the initial access through spear-phishing emails and is more about injecting code into processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the OceanLotus Group used spear-phishing emails with both attachments and links. The most specific and relevant TTPs from the related list are T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
   - Since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the initial access, and both spear-phishing attachment and spear-phishing link are part of the broader T1566-Phishing technique, the most plausible answer is the broader technique that encompasses both.

### Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
