Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Regin gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic.
2. This information contributed to its discovery capabilities.
3. The next step was capturing credentials by analyzing network traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information about the network environment.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically follows the gathering of information and precedes the capture of credentials by analyzing network traffic.

- **A: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves archiving data, which does not directly relate to the gathering of information or the analysis of network traffic.
- **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic, which aligns with the question's description of gathering information and contributing to discovery capabilities.
- **C: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to capture credentials, which is the next step after gathering information.
- **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections, which is more about identifying network connections rather than capturing credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gathering Information**: Regin gathers information on processes, memory utilization, and monitors network traffic.
2. **Contribution to Discovery**: This information contributes to its discovery capabilities.
3. **Next Step**: The next step is to capture credentials by analyzing network traffic.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence is:
- **T1040-Network Sniffing** (gathering network traffic) -> **T1003.001-LSASS Memory** (capturing credentials).

However, the question specifically asks for the TTP that occurs after gathering information and before capturing credentials by analyzing network traffic. Therefore, the most appropriate TTP is **T1040-Network Sniffing**.

### Final Answer: B: T1040-Network Sniffing
