Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT28 deployed additional modules (like pr.dll) to collect and upload stolen data to the C&C server, and then exfiltrated specific information such as .pst and .dbx files to the central server. We need to identify the TTP that logically occurs between these two steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. However, it does not necessarily fit as a step between deploying modules and exfiltrating specific files. It is more about the method of exfiltration rather than the intermediate step.

- **B: T1218.011-Rundll32**
  - This technique involves using the Rundll32.exe utility to execute code. While it can be used to deploy additional modules, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration of specific files. It is more about the deployment phase rather than the exfiltration phase.

- **C: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle**
  - This technique involves intercepting and modifying network traffic. While it can be used to manipulate data during exfiltration, it does not directly fit as a step between deploying modules and exfiltrating specific files.

- **D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories. This fits well as a step between deploying modules to collect data and exfiltrating specific files. It aligns with the process of gathering the .pst and .dbx files before exfiltrating them.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where APT28 first deploys modules to collect data, then exfiltrates specific files.
- T1213-Data from Information Repositories (D) fits as the intermediate step where the data (specific files like .pst and .dbx) is collected before exfiltration.
- The other techniques (T1071, T1218.011, and T1557) do not fit as well in the sequence described.

**Final Answer: D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
