### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda uses embedded HTA scripts from spearphished '.lnk' files to deliver payloads like Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution and the Techniques: T1204.002-Malicious File and T1204.001-Malicious Link.
   - T1204.001-Malicious Link specifically refers to the use of malicious links, which aligns with the '.lnk' files mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading** - This technique involves making a file or process appear to be something else. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the deception of users into clicking a link.
   - **B: T1070.006-Timestomp** - This technique involves altering the file timestamps to make a file appear to be legitimate. It is not directly related to deceiving users into clicking a link.
   - **C: T1647-Plist File Modification** - This technique involves modifying macOS property list files. It is not relevant to the '.lnk' files mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves the use of social engineering to trick users into performing an action, such as clicking a link. This aligns well with the scenario of deceiving users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
