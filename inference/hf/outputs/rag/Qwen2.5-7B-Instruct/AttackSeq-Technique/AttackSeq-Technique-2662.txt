Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the Korplug malware has already gathered system information and network details. The next step is to enable the malware to access and collect data from shared resources within the target's network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided related TTPs:

- **A: T1555.002-Securityd Memory**
  - This technique is not directly related to the context of the question, which focuses on accessing shared resources.
  
- **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique is already mentioned in the question and related TTPs. It is about gathering system information, which has already been done by the malware.
  
- **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
  - This technique directly relates to accessing and collecting data from shared resources within the network, which is the next step after gathering system information.
  
- **D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
  - This technique involves accessing configuration data, which is not directly related to the context of accessing shared resources.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already gathered system information and network details (T1082-System Information Discovery).
- The next logical step is to access and collect data from shared resources within the network.
- T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive is the most relevant technique for this next step.

### Final Answer: C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive
