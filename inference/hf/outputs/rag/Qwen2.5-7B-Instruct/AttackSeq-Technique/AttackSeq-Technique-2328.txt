Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Operation Overtrap used phishing links in spam emails.
2. These links led victims to fake banking websites.
3. The fake banking websites enabled the execution of code via the Bottle Exploit Kit.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link to a user, which aligns with the phishing links used in the spam emails.
- **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is also related to spearphishing, but it is more focused on the reconnaissance phase, which is not the immediate next step after the initial access.

### Step 4: Determine the Next TTP
After the initial access via phishing links, the next step would be the execution of the exploit. The question mentions the use of the Bottle Exploit Kit to execute code. This execution of code is a critical step after the initial access.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
- **A: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique, which has already been described in the question.
- **B: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the execution of code via an exploit kit.
- **C: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**: This technique involves tracing system calls, which is not directly related to the execution of code via an exploit kit.
- **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves spearphishing through a service, which is not directly related to the execution of code via an exploit kit.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access via phishing links is the execution of code via the Bottle Exploit Kit. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1543-Create or Modify System Process
