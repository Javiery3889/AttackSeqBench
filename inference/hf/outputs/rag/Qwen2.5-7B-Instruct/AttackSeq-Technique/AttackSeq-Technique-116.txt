Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Agrius first exploited a vulnerability (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379) to upload webshells for lateral movement. The next step in the sequence is achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Persistence (Tactic):** T1543.003-Windows Service, T1133-External Remote Services

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions**
  - This technique is about modifying file or path exclusions to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the sequence of uploading webshells and then achieving persistence by registering a service.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain a covert communication channel. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the sequence of uploading webshells and then registering a service.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**
  - This technique involves using a network device command-line interface. It is not directly related to the sequence of uploading webshells and then registering a service.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence. It directly aligns with the step of registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service, which is the next step in the sequence after uploading webshells.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Agrius first exploits a vulnerability to upload webshells for lateral movement.
- The next step in the sequence is achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.
- Among the given answer choices, T1569-System Services (Answer Choice D) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the step of registering a service for persistence.

### Final Answer: D
