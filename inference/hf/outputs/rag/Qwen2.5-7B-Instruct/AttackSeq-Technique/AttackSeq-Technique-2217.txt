Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where tools have been transferred and network tunnels have been established for lateral movement. The next step is to ensure secure communication with compromised systems and mimic normal traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic, which can help in mimicking normal traffic and ensuring secure communication.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
  - **Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally within a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique is about exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is not directly related to ensuring secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.
- **Answer Choice B: T1137.005-Outlook Rules**
  - This technique involves using Outlook rules to manipulate email traffic, which is not directly related to the context of the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
  - This technique is about generating domain names for C2 communication, which is not directly related to ensuring secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.
- **Answer Choice D: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic, which aligns well with the need to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the need to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic after establishing network tunnels for lateral movement.
- The related TTPs mention the use of an external proxy (T1090.002) to route traffic, which is a plausible method to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic.
- None of the other answer choices directly address the need to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic in the context of the question.

### Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy
