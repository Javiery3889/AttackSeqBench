Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. The attacker gathers and uploads system information to a C&C server using HTTP POST.
2. The C&C server initially resolves to IP addresses hosted in the United States.
3. Later, the IP address switches to a Chinese IP address.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering internet connections.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback channels for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to IP addresses. While it could be used to switch between IP addresses, it doesn't directly address the initial establishment of communication or the fallback channels.

- **B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This is the same as A, so it's redundant and not a valid choice.

- **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
  - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding information. It doesn't directly relate to establishing communication or switching IP addresses.

- **D: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing web portals, which is not directly related to establishing communication or switching IP addresses.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique is directly related to using web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the HTTP POST method used for uploading system information.
- **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering internet connections, which could be part of the initial setup.
- **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback channels, which aligns with the switching of IP addresses from U.S. to Chinese.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Initial Communication**: Establishing the initial connection using a technique that involves web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
- **Fallback Channels**: Using fallback channels to switch IP addresses (T1008-Fallback Channels).

However, the question specifically asks for the technique that was most likely employed to establish communication with the C&C servers initially resolving to IP addresses hosted in the United States and later switching to a Chinese IP address. The most relevant TTP here is **T1008-Fallback Channels**.

### Final Answer: D
