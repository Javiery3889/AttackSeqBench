Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Elise malware performed obfuscation techniques for data exfiltration.
2. The data exfiltration used base64-encoded cookie values.
3. The malware has heavy anti-virtual-machine features.
4. The malware spoofed queries to non-existing domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection.
- **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data difficult to understand or interpret.
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves encoding or encrypting files or information to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1218.014-MMC**: This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to perform actions. It does not align with the described data exfiltration or anti-virtual-machine features.
- **B: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files. It does not align with the described data exfiltration or anti-virtual-machine features.
- **C: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows Registry. While it could be part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly align with the described data exfiltration or anti-virtual-machine features.
- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. This aligns with the described heavy anti-virtual-machine features and the spoofing of queries to non-existing domains.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving data exfiltration and anti-virtual-machine evasion.
- The related TTPs mention data obfuscation and standard encoding, which align with the base64-encoded cookie values.
- The anti-virtual-machine features and spoofing of queries to non-existing domains are best aligned with the T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion technique.

### Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
