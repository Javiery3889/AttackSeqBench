### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a vulnerability exploit is used to execute an embedded .hta file via `mshta.exe`.
   - The goal is to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about hiding or obscuring an attacker's presence.
   - **Technique: T1218.005-Mshta** - This technique involves using `mshta.exe` to execute malicious .hta files.
   - **Tactic: Execution** - This tactic is about running code or scripts on the target system.
   - **Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to run at regular intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**
     - This technique is about clearing event logs to hide the attacker's activities. It does not directly relate to maintaining the presence of a Trojan by executing files at regular intervals.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to run at regular intervals. This aligns well with the goal of maintaining the Trojan's presence by ensuring it runs periodically.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain access. It does not directly relate to the execution of files at regular intervals.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**
     - This technique involves changing file associations to execute malicious code when a specific file type is opened. While it can be used to execute files, it does not directly address the need to run files at regular intervals.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to maintain the Helminth Trojan agent's presence by automatically executing files at regular intervals is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.

Final Answer: B
