### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor function gathers machine information during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is to extract visual data from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques for Discovery, specifically:
     - T1124-System Time Discovery
     - T1082-System Information Discovery
   - These techniques are part of the Discovery phase and are used to gather information about the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots or screen content, which aligns with the extraction of visual data.
   - **B: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities, which is not directly related to extracting visual data.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services, which is not directly related to extracting visual data.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - This technique involves using Confluence, a collaborative document management tool, which is not directly related to extracting visual data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need to extract visual data, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1113-Screen Capture.

### Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture
