### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the dropper apps are obfuscated and communication is encrypted to evade detection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SideWinder's callCam app began collecting extensive information from compromised devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves removing obfuscation or decryption from files or information to make them usable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1090.004-Domain Fronting** - This technique is used to hide the true destination of network traffic, which is not directly related to the collection of information from compromised devices.
   - **Option B: T1560-Archive Collected Data** - This technique involves archiving data, which is more about storing data rather than the initial collection process.
   - **Option C: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** - This technique involves discovering domain trust relationships, which is not directly related to the initial collection of information.
   - **Option D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the need to find and collect information from compromised devices.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is that the technique used to discover and collect information from compromised devices would be **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.
   - This technique directly relates to the initial step of finding and accessing files and directories on the compromised devices, which is necessary before the callCam app can begin collecting extensive information.

**Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
