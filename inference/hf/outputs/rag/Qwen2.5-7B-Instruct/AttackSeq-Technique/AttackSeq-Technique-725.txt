### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs during Operation Sharpshooter.
   - The sequence involves establishing persistence by placing a second-stage binary in the startup folder.
   - The next step is the Rising Sun implant communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is relevant to the persistence technique.
   - The tactic is Persistence, indicating that the focus is on maintaining long-term access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - **B: T1012-Query Registry** - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry. It could be a step before communication, but it is not directly related to the persistence technique mentioned.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks** - This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in a desired state. It could be a step before communication, but it is not directly related to the persistence technique mentioned.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves collecting information about the victim, which could be a step before communication. However, it is not directly related to the persistence technique mentioned.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of establishing persistence and the communication with control servers, is likely to involve a step that ensures the system is in a desired state or checks for necessary conditions before communication.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks** is the most relevant technique as it aligns with ensuring the system is in a state that allows for the next step, which is communication with control servers.

### Final Answer: C
