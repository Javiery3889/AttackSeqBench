### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an iOS malware app is installed with a hidden icon and runs in the background.
   - The app then collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Collection Tactic:** The malware is collecting data from the local system.
   - **Discovery Tactic:** The malware is discovering software on the system.
   - **Defense Evasion Tactic:** The malware is modifying Plist files to hide its presence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly address the initial installation and background execution.
   - **B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage**
     - This technique involves using thread local storage to store data. It is not directly related to the initial installation or background execution of the malware.
   - **C: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code in the context of a user. This could be relevant as the malware is installed and runs in the background, but it does not directly address the collection of data.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. While it could be used to ensure the malware runs in the background, it does not directly address the initial installation or the collection of data.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial installation and background execution of the malware are critical steps. The technique that best fits this initial phase is **T1204-User Execution**. This technique ensures that the malware runs in the background, which aligns with the question's description of the app running in the background after installation.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
