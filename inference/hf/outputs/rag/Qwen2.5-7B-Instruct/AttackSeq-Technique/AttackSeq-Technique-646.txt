### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a threat actor bypasses environment-based checks during execution, specifically mentioning a 'CPU core check' to detect virtualization.
   - The goal is to ensure the implanted Remote Access Tool (RAT) can execute upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention tactics of "Discovery" and "Defense Evasion," and a specific technique "T1497.001-System Checks."
   - This indicates that the threat actor is actively trying to evade detection and ensure the RAT can run undetected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic. It does not directly relate to ensuring the RAT executes at startup.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique directly involves ensuring that a malicious payload is executed at system boot or logon. This aligns well with the goal of ensuring the RAT can run upon system startup.
   - **C: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
     - This technique involves the threat actor staging or preparing the environment for further attacks. It does not directly address the execution at startup.
   - **D: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves using a bootkit to gain persistent access. While it ensures persistence, it is more focused on the initial infection and less on the specific goal of ensuring execution at startup.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the implanted RAT can execute upon system startup, given the context of bypassing environment-based checks and ensuring persistence, is:

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
