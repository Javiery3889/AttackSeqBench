Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Sednit during an attack. Specifically, it mentions the execution of a Delphi downloader that uses Windows API functions and `cmd.exe` to gather system information. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred beforehand as part of their targeting strategy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the network infrastructure of the target. While it is related to discovery, it does not directly align with the execution and gathering of system information as described in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. While it is part of the execution phase, it does not directly align with the gathering of system information as described in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1590.004-Network Topology**
  - This sub-technique involves gathering information about the network topology. While it is related to discovery, it does not directly align with the execution and gathering of system information as described in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**
  - This technique involves searching for information in open technical databases. While it is related to discovery, it does not directly align with the execution and gathering of system information as described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the Delphi downloader is used to gather system information using `cmd.exe`. This indicates that the attack sequence involves both execution and discovery.
- The related TTPs mention `T1059.003-Windows Command Shell` and `T1082-System Information Discovery`, which align with the described actions.
- Among the answer choices, `T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution` (Answer Choice B) is the most plausible because it involves ensuring that the malware is executed, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent actions of gathering system information.

### Final Answer: B
