Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A RAT (Remote Access Tool) leverages Defense Evasion techniques by mimicking SSL traffic and encoding C&C (Command and Control) data.
2. The next step involves enabling communication with the C&C server using HTTP POST requests with encoded data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
  - This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. Given that the next step involves using HTTP POST requests, this technique is relevant.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances**
  - This technique is about evading network security appliances. It does not directly relate to the use of HTTP POST requests for C&C communication.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C&C. While it is related to web protocols, T1071.001 is more specific and directly relevant to the HTTP POST requests mentioned.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters for C&C. It does not directly relate to the use of HTTP POST requests for C&C communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of HTTP POST requests for C&C communication, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
- T1132.001-Standard Encoding is mentioned, which is relevant to the encoding of C&C data, but it does not directly describe the use of HTTP POST requests.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a broader term that includes web protocols, making T1071.001 more specific and directly relevant.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
