### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Gamaredon uses a backdoor to list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase.
   - The next step is to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection**
     - **Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves gathering data from network shared drives.
     - **Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1596.002-WHOIS**
     - WHOIS is used to query and display information about domain names. It does not align with the context of gathering sensitive documents from the local system or network shares.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - Subverting trust controls involves compromising the trust relationships within a system. This does not directly relate to gathering sensitive documents.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - Automated Collection involves the automated gathering of data. This aligns well with the context of listing interesting files and then gathering sensitive documents.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - Confluence is a collaborative document management tool. It does not directly relate to the context of gathering data from the local system or network shares.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **T1119-Automated Collection**.

**Final Answer: C**
