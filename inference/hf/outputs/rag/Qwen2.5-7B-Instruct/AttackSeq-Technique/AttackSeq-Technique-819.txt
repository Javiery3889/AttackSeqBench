Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN4 initially gained access through spearphishing emails with VBA macros. Before this, the question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to gather details about individuals with access to confidential information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros, which aligns with the VBA macros mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending malicious attachments via email, which is also mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the target to improve the effectiveness of a phishing attack. It fits well with the context of gathering details about individuals with access to confidential information before the spearphishing attack.
- **Answer Choice B: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves using a malicious DLL to execute code when a user logs on. It does not directly relate to gathering information about individuals.
- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending malicious links or attachments via email. While it is related to the spearphishing attack, it does not specifically gather information about individuals.
- **Answer Choice D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: This technique involves searching for information on the victim's websites. It is not directly related to the context of gathering information about individuals with access to confidential information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about gathering details about individuals with access to confidential information before the spearphishing attack.
- T1598-Phishing for Information (Answer Choice A) is the most relevant technique as it directly involves gathering information about the target.
- The other techniques (T1547.004, T1566, and T1594) do not fit the context as well as T1598.

### Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information
