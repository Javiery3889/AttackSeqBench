Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The ThreatNeedle backdoor is deployed for initial reconnaissance.
2. Lateral movement is facilitated using the backdoor.
3. During the discovery phase, the Lazarus group conducted activities such as system network configuration and file discovery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique is relevant to the initial reconnaissance and lateral movement facilitated by the ThreatNeedle backdoor.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique is directly related to the system network configuration discovery.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is directly related to file and directory discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which of the answer choices aligns best with the discovery phase activities mentioned in the question.

- **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is related to discovering network services, which is part of the discovery phase but not specifically mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**: This technique is related to discovering cloud services, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is related to discovering system information, which is a broad category that could include both system network configuration and file discovery.
- **D: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique is related to phishing, which is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the described activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the discovery phase involved system network configuration and file discovery.
- Among the related TTPs, T1082-System Information Discovery is the most specific and directly aligns with the activities mentioned in the question.
- T1082 encompasses both system network configuration and file discovery, making it the most plausible choice.

### Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery
