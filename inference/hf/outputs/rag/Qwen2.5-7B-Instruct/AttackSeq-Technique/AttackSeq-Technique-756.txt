### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious XLS macro is used to download and install SunSeed malware, and then the malware establishes a connection to a staging server.
   - The final step in the sequence is to ensure that the SunSeed malware automatically runs at Windows Startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique is about using multiple channels to communicate with the C2 server, which is relevant to the initial download and connection to the staging server.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves ensuring that malware runs at system startup or logon.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique is also about ensuring the malware persists on the system, which aligns with the requirement to run at Windows Startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection** - This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to ensuring malware runs at Windows Startup.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique directly addresses the requirement to ensure malware runs at system startup or logon, which is the final step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware. It is not relevant to the technical step of ensuring malware runs at Windows Startup.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking** - This technique involves modifying the system's search order to load a malicious DLL. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to ensuring malware runs at Windows Startup.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to ensure SunSeed malware automatically runs at Windows Startup is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B**
