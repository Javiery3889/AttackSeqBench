Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Smooth Operator initiated without affecting normal usage of the library.
2. The next step is to collect domain and account name values from 3CX file config.json for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering system information, which does not directly fit the sequence described in the question. It is more about discovering information rather than initiating a process and collecting specific values.

- **Answer Choice B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - This technique involves manipulating network traffic by poisoning ARP tables. It does not fit the sequence described, as it is more about network manipulation rather than initiating a process and collecting specific values.

- **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which also does not fit the sequence described. It is more about cleaning up traces rather than initiating a process and collecting specific values.

- **Answer Choice D: T1484.002-Trust Modification**
  - This technique involves modifying trust relationships, which could be relevant if the goal is to initiate a process without affecting normal usage. It aligns with the idea of initiating a process without affecting normal usage of the library.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is initiated by T1484.002-Trust Modification, followed by T1560.002-Archive via Library, and then T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: D
