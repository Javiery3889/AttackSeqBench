Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports. This implies that the technique in question should be a preparatory step that enables the subsequent steps of establishing encrypted and hex-encoded communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection, which is a common preparatory step before using more sophisticated methods like encrypted and hex-encoded data.
  - **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is a method to evade detection and establish a covert channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names, which is more about the C2 infrastructure and not a preparatory step for the communication method.
- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the communication method described.
- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels, which is the final step in the communication process, not a preparatory step.
- **D: T1547.012-Print Processors**: This technique involves using print processors for data exfiltration, which is not directly related to the communication method described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1132.001-Standard Encoding** is a technique that involves encoding data to avoid detection. This is a common preparatory step before using more sophisticated methods like encrypted and hex-encoded data.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port** is a technique that involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is a method to evade detection and establish a covert channel. However, it is more about the method of communication rather than a preparatory step.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible preparatory step that enables the subsequent steps of establishing encrypted and hex-encoded communication is **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**.

### Final Answer: A
