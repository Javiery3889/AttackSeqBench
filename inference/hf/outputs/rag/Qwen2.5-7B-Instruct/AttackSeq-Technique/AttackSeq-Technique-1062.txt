### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a modular design with components like loaders and stealth implants, indicating the system is designed to operate covertly on infected systems.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to prevent detection and forensic analysis.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence** and **Technique: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules** suggest the system is designed to maintain long-term access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** and **Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp** indicate the system is designed to alter timestamps to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** and **Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads** suggest the system is designed to hide or obfuscate its payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process** - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to evade detection. While it can be used for persistence, it does not directly address the prevention of detection and forensic analysis.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to evade detection. It aligns well with the goal of preventing detection and forensic analysis.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly address the prevention of detection and forensic analysis.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access. It does not directly address the prevention of detection and forensic analysis.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs to prevent detection and forensic analysis on the compromised systems is **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**.

Final Answer: B
