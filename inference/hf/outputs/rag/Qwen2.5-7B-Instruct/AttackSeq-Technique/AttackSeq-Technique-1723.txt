### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where CozyDuke establishes persistence and then maintains communication with its C&C server.
   - The communication is done through HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter, which are application layer protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves using a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking COM objects to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1552.004-Private Keys**
     - This technique involves using private keys for encryption or authentication. It does not directly relate to maintaining communication with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) to communicate with a C&C server. This aligns well with the question's description of maintaining communication through HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code at boot or logon to maintain persistence. While it is related to persistence, it does not directly address the communication aspect.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for encryption. It does not directly relate to maintaining communication with a C&C server.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's description of maintaining communication with a C&C server through HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter is:

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
