Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the first step is modifying registry settings to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security. The next step is to enable communication and execute commands from a C2 server. We need to identify which of the given answer choices aligns best with this sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**: This confirms that modifying registry settings is part of the attack sequence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This suggests that tools or defenses are being disabled or modified, which aligns with the first step of disabling Internet Explorer Enhanced Security.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. It does not directly relate to enabling communication with a C2 server.
- **B: T1601-Modify System Image**: This technique involves modifying the system image, which is not directly related to enabling communication with a C2 server.
- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which could be part of the attack but does not directly enable communication with a C2 server.
- **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using remote access software to establish a connection to a C2 server, which directly enables communication and execution of commands from the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first step is modifying registry settings to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security, which is confirmed by the related TTP T1112-Modify Registry.
- The next step is to enable communication and execute commands from a C2 server, which is best described by the T1219-Remote Access Software technique.

### Final Answer: D: T1219-Remote Access Software
