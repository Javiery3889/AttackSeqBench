Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: Whitefly gained initial access via spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper.
- **Execution**: The dropper (Trojan.Vcrodat) executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access**: Techniques T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment are relevant.
- **Tactic: Execution**: Technique T1204.002-Malicious File is relevant.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**
  - This technique involves exploiting a web page to deliver malware. It does not align with the scenario of spear-phishing emails.
- **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering remote systems. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the execution of malicious DLLs.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. It is relevant to the execution of malicious DLLs, but it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
- **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or deploy malware. It is relevant to the execution of malicious DLLs and aligns well with the scenario of gaining elevated privileges after initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) led to the execution of a dropper (Trojan.Vcrodat).
- **Execution**: The dropper (Trojan.Vcrodat) executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.
- **Relevance**: Among the given choices, T1072-Software Deployment Tools (D) is the most relevant to the execution of malicious DLLs and aligns with the context of gaining elevated privileges.

### Final Answer: D
