Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already employed defense evasion techniques (T1190, T1562.008) and is now moving laterally by accessing shared folders over SMB using compromised domain credentials (T1021.002).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement
- Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices logically precedes T1021.002 in the attack sequence.

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the lateral movement via SMB shares.

- **B: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**
  - This technique involves using asynchronous procedure calls to perform actions. It is not directly related to the lateral movement via SMB shares.

- **C: T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud logs to evade detection. While it is a defense evasion technique, it does not directly lead to the lateral movement via SMB shares.

- **D: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
  - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain elevated privileges. Compromised domain credentials (which are used in T1021.002) often involve access token manipulation to gain the necessary privileges to access shared folders over SMB.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attacker has already evaded defenses and is now moving laterally.
- T1134 (Access Token Manipulation) is a common technique used to gain the necessary privileges to access shared folders over SMB (T1021.002).
- The other techniques (T1190, T1562.008, and T1055.004) do not directly lead to the specific lateral movement via SMB shares.

### Final Answer: D: T1134-Access Token Manipulation
