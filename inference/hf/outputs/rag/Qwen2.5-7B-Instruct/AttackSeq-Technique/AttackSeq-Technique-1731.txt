### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker first exploits 1-day vulnerabilities in a VPN service to gain initial access.
   - The attacker then uses tools like JuicyPotato or ProcDump with Mimikatz to escalate privileges.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely ensured persistence for the Fox Kitten Campaign.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access to the target network. This could be relevant if the attacker uses a remote service to ensure persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges. This is mentioned as a step after gaining initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1078.003-Local Accounts** - This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts to maintain access. While it can be a method of persistence, it does not directly relate to the use of external remote services.
   - **Option B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain access. It does not directly relate to persistence.
   - **Option C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It is not directly related to persistence.
   - **Option D: T1136-Create Account** - This technique involves creating new accounts to maintain access. While it can be a method of persistence, it does not directly relate to the use of external remote services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for ensuring persistence, given the context of using external remote services, is T1133-External Remote Services.
   - This technique aligns with the use of external services to maintain access, which is a common method for ensuring persistence in the context of the Fox Kitten Campaign.

**Final Answer: T1133-External Remote Services (Option A)**
