### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial compromise via an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
   - The attackers then need to secure alternative means of access to maintain control over the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is relevant as it describes the initial compromise via an unpatched application.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access, which aligns with the need to secure alternative means of access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique is not directly related to maintaining access or persistence. It is more about stealing financial information, which does not fit the context of the question.
   - **B: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a command or script. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct or common method for securing alternative access after an initial compromise.
   - **C: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating new user accounts to maintain access. This is a plausible method for securing alternative means of access, as it directly addresses the need to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which is not directly related to securing alternative access after an initial compromise.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the need to secure alternative means of access after an initial compromise is **T1136-Create Account**.

**Final Answer: C: T1136-Create Account**
