Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Windows cached password hashes are dumped using PoisonIvy.
2. The attackers then identify and move laterally to systems hosting sensitive intellectual property.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials**
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
  - This technique involves using administrative shares to access files and directories. While it can be part of lateral movement, it does not directly relate to the dumping of cached password hashes or the use of pass the hash.

- **Answer Choice B: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code. It is more about social engineering and does not directly relate to the dumping of cached credentials or lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, such as pass the hash, to gain access to systems. This aligns well with the use of pass the hash mentioned in the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
  - This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools. While it can be part of the attack chain, it does not directly relate to the dumping of cached credentials or the use of pass the hash.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions dumping Windows cached password hashes using PoisonIvy, which is a form of credential access.
- The attackers then move laterally to systems hosting sensitive intellectual property, which is a form of lateral movement.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of pass the hash (T1550.002) for both credential access and lateral movement.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of pass the hash (T1550.002) for both credential access and lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C**
