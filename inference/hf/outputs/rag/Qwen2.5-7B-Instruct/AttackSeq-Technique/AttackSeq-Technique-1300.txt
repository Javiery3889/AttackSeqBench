Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. The initial exploitation is via CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document.
2. The next step is prior to credential access techniques like searching for stored passwords in registry keys.
3. The question asks which technique most likely involved evading detection by concealing malicious activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**: This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making malicious content appear legitimate to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This technique involves repeatedly attempting to log in using different credentials. It does not directly relate to hiding or evading detection.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to hiding or evading detection.
- **C: T1564.005-Hidden File System**: This technique involves hiding files in a file system to evade detection. It aligns well with the context of hiding malicious activities.
- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. It is a broader category that includes hiding files and directories, which aligns well with the context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial exploitation via CVE-2017-11882 and the hidden object in an Excel document suggest that the attacker is trying to hide the malicious activity.
- The next step, prior to credential access techniques, indicates that the attacker is still in the process of evading detection.
- Among the related TTPs, T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories and T1036-Masquerading are directly related to hiding activities.
- T1564.005-Hidden File System is a more specific technique that aligns well with the context of hiding files and directories.
- T1564-Hide Artifacts is a broader category that includes hiding files and directories, making it a plausible choice.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.

### Final Answer: C: T1564.005-Hidden File System
