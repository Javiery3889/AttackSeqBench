### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus Group first used encrypted configuration files for defense evasion, then utilized compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely involved the collection of information related to the target's system details before these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the "Defense Evasion" tactic and involve "Valid Accounts" (T1078).
   - T1078.002 and T1078.003 are sub-techniques of T1078, which deal with domain and local accounts, respectively.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery** - This technique involves discovering and potentially exfiltrating data from peripheral devices. It does not directly relate to the collection of system details.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing information or clicking on malicious links. It does not directly relate to the collection of system details.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the target's system, such as system configurations, network topology, and user information. This aligns well with the question's requirement of collecting system details.
   - **D: T1087.001-Local Account** - This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts. While it is related to accounts, it does not specifically mention the collection of system details.

### Final Answer:
The technique that most likely involved the collection of information related to the target's system details before the use of encrypted configuration files for defense evasion and the utilization of compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
