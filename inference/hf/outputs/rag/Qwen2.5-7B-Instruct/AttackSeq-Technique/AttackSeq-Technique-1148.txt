Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Execution of "mic.exe" for loading and decrypting associated files.
2. Decoding the "mic.ver" configuration file.
3. Facilitating communication with the C&C server after decoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which answer choice aligns best with the described sequence of actions, particularly focusing on the communication with the C&C server after decoding the configuration file.

- **A: T1001-Data Obfuscation** - This technique is about making data difficult to understand, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
- **B: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File** - This technique involves the use of encryption or encoding to protect files. While it is related to the initial decryption of "mic.exe" and "mic.ver", it does not directly address the communication with the C&C server.
- **C: T1071.001-Web Protocols** - This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control. This is a plausible choice as it directly addresses the communication with the C&C server.
- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique is similar to T1001 and involves making files or information difficult to understand, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the execution of "mic.exe" and the decoding of "mic.ver" configuration file.
- The related TTPs indicate that the technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files, which aligns with the decoding of "mic.ver".
- The communication with the C&C server is the final step, and among the given choices, T1071.001-Web Protocols is the most relevant for this step.

### Final Answer: C: T1071.001-Web Protocols
