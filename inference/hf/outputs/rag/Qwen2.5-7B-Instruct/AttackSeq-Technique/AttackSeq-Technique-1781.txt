Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The malware (Sayad) gathers system data and running processes.
2. It captures data from removable media.
3. It communicates with its C2 server to upload encrypted data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Collection**
  - **Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media.
  - **Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves collecting data automatically, which could be part of the initial data gathering phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which TTP aligns best with the sequence described in the question.

- **Option A: T1125-Video Capture**
  - This technique is not relevant to the question as it pertains to capturing video data, not data from removable media.

- **Option B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - This technique directly matches the part of the sequence where data is captured from removable media. It is a clear fit for the question.

- **Option C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
  - This technique involves running a virtual instance, which is not directly related to capturing data from removable media.

- **Option D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information, which is not directly related to capturing data from removable media.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first gathers system data and running processes, then captures data from removable media, and finally communicates with its C2 server.
- The related TTPs mention T1025-Data from Removable Media, which directly aligns with the part of the sequence where data is captured from removable media.
- None of the other options (T1125-Video Capture, T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) are relevant to capturing data from removable media.

### Final Answer: B: T1025-Data from Removable Media
