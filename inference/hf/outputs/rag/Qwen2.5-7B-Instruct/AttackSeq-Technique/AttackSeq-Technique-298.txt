Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A mobile configuration profile is used to distribute and install the custom iOS surveillanceware Phenakite.
2. Arid Viper achieves command and control by utilizing a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration of collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Collection**: T1560-Archive Collected Data, T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1589.001-Credentials
- This technique involves the use of credentials to gain access to systems or data.
- It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of collected data via a misconfigured Firebase server.

#### B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution
- This technique involves executing a payload or command based on an event.
- It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of collected data via a misconfigured Firebase server.

#### C: T1098.006-Additional Container Cluster Roles
- This technique involves modifying container cluster roles to gain additional privileges.
- It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of collected data via a misconfigured Firebase server.

#### D: T1102-Web Service
- This technique involves using a web service to establish or maintain a foothold.
- It aligns with the use of a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration of collected data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration, which is directly related to the T1102-Web Service technique.
- The other techniques (T1589.001, T1546, and T1098.006) do not align with the specific exfiltration method described.

### Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service
