### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers first perform an action that allows a RAT payload to remain in memory and then inject it into a new process to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" tactics and specifically mention "T1055.012-Process Hollowing" and "T1055-Process Injection."
   - T1055.012-Process Hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is loaded into memory, and then the legitimate process is replaced with malicious code.
   - T1055-Process Injection is the technique of injecting malicious code into the memory space of a legitimate process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**:
     - This technique involves setting up a malicious payload to run automatically at system boot or logon. While it can be part of an initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the sequence of injecting a payload into a new process.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**:
     - This technique directly involves injecting malicious code into a process, which aligns with the second part of the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: T1548.001-Setuid and Setgid**:
     - This technique involves setting the setuid or setgid bits on a file to allow it to run with the permissions of the file's owner or group. It does not directly relate to the sequence of injecting a payload into a new process.
   - **D: T1218.012-Verclsid**:
     - This technique involves using a valid CLSID (Class Identifier) to execute a malicious payload. It does not directly relate to the sequence of injecting a payload into a new process.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first used a technique to inject malicious code into a process, which aligns with T1055-Process Injection. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1055-Process Injection**
