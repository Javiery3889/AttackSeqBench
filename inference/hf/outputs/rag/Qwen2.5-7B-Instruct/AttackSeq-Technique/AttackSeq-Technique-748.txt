Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tortoiseshell malware is used to confirm Google is reachable.
2. The malware bypasses network-based defenses.
3. A reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collects detailed system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which TTPs align with the sequence described in the question and fit logically between the malware confirming reachability and the reconnaissance tool collecting system information.

- **T1534-Internal Spearphishing (A)**: This technique involves sending a malicious payload via email. It does not fit the sequence as it is not related to confirming reachability or bypassing network defenses.
- **T1566-Phishing (B)**: Similar to T1534, this technique involves phishing emails. It also does not fit the sequence as it is not related to the described actions.
- **T1134-Access Token Manipulation (C)**: This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain elevated privileges. While it is a common TTP, it does not directly relate to confirming reachability or bypassing network defenses.
- **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (D)**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It fits the context of bypassing network-based defenses but does not directly relate to the collection of system information.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Tortoiseshell malware confirms reachability and bypasses network defenses.
2. The malware then performs some action that allows it to collect detailed system information.
3. 'bird.exe' is a reconnaissance tool that collects detailed system information.

The TTP that best fits the step between confirming reachability and collecting system information is likely to be a technique that allows the malware to establish a foothold and gain deeper access. **T1134-Access Token Manipulation** (C) is the most fitting choice as it allows the malware to gain elevated privileges, which would enable it to collect detailed system information.

### Final Answer: C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation
