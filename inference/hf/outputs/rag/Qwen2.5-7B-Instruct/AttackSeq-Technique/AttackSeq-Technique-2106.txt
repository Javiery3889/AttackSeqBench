### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where data is exfiltrated over a C&C channel using an encrypted communication protocol.
   - After exfiltration, the attackers disrupted the availability of the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention exfiltration over a C&C channel and the use of an encrypted communication protocol, which aligns with the question's description.
   - The related TTPs do not directly mention disrupting the availability of the system, but they provide context for the exfiltration process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network configurations, which is not directly related to disrupting system availability.
   - **B: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**
     - This technique involves shutting down or rebooting the system, which can disrupt availability. This is a plausible choice.
   - **C: T1565.003-Runtime Data Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating data while it is in use, which is not directly related to disrupting system availability.
   - **D: T1037.002-Login Hook**
     - This technique involves creating a login hook to execute code when a user logs in, which is not directly related to disrupting system availability.

### Final Answer:
- Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that disrupts the availability of the victim's system after exfiltration is **T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**.

**Final Answer: B**
