Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Stolen credentials are used to gain initial access.
2. PowerShell scripts are executed to deploy the LightNeuron backdoor.
3. The LightNeuron backdoor then collects information about system network configurations using commands like `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access. While it is a valid initial access technique, it does not directly relate to the subsequent actions of collecting system network configuration information.

- **Answer Choice B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique directly involves discovering system network configurations, which aligns with the actions described in the question (using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`).

- **Answer Choice C: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
  - This technique involves duplicating network traffic, which is not directly related to the actions of collecting system network configuration information.

- **Answer Choice D: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing network traffic, which is also not directly related to the actions of collecting system network configuration information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attacker gains initial access, deploys a backdoor, and then collects system network configuration information.
- The related TTPs specifically mention `T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery`, which directly aligns with the actions described in the question.
- None of the other TTPs (T1078, T1020.001, T1040) are as directly relevant to the described actions.

### Final Answer: B
