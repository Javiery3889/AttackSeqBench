Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained remote access to hotel front desks and stolen credit card details. The next step in the attack sequence is to collect additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from local systems, which aligns with the initial compromise and data theft.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves gaining access to a system through a malicious website or drive-by download, which is a method of initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to monitoring OTA websites or hotel personnel activities.
- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information, which is not directly related to monitoring OTA websites or hotel personnel activities.
- **Answer Choice C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, which could be relevant to collecting data from OTA websites or hotel personnel activities.
- **Answer Choice D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves deploying software to gain access or perform actions, which is not directly related to monitoring OTA websites or hotel personnel activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already gained remote access and stolen credit card details, which aligns with the T1189-Drive-by Compromise technique.
- The next step is to collect additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities. This involves gathering data from external sources, which aligns with the T1213-Data from Information Repositories technique.

### Final Answer: C
