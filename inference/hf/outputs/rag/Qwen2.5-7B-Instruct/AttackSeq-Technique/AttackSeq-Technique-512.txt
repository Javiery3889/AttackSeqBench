Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Persistence is achieved through HKCU autorun system registry keys (Run and RunOnce).
2. Encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data is transmitted via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which answer choice aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
  - This technique is about gathering information about the victim's organization. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for data exfiltration or command and control. HTTP POST requests fall under this category, making it a strong candidate.

- **Answer Choice C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of non-application layer protocols for data exfiltration or command and control. HTTP POST requests are application layer protocols, so this does not fit.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves executing code at boot or logon. While it is related to persistence, it does not directly address the transmission of data via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence through registry keys and the transmission of data via HTTP POST requests.
- The related TTPs confirm that the persistence technique is T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.
- The transmission of data via HTTP POST requests is best described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves the use of an application layer protocol for communication.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
