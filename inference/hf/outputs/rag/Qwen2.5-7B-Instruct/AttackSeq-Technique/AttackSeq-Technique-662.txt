### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Gallmaker used three primary IP addresses for C&C communication after leveraging LotL tactics.
   - The sequence is: LotL -> ? -> C&C with three IP addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Command and Control (C&C) tactic.
   - T1071.004-DNS: DNS is a common method for C&C communication.
   - T1568-Dynamic Resolution: This technique involves dynamically resolving C&C domains, which is also a C&C method.
   - T1008-Fallback Channels: This technique involves using multiple fallback channels for C&C communication, which aligns with using three IP addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools into the target environment, which does not fit the sequence as it is not a C&C technique.
   - **B: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique is about using inter-process communication for C&C, but it does not specifically mention IP addresses or fallback channels.
   - **C: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using multiple fallback channels for C&C communication, which aligns with using three IP addresses for C&C.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique is about obfuscating data to evade detection, which does not fit the sequence as it is not a C&C technique.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the technique that occurred after LotL tactics and before C&C with three IP addresses is T1008-Fallback Channels.

**Final Answer: C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
