### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malicious shortcut files are used to gain initial access, followed by a technique to evade detection using anti-analysis features of Asruex.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows the use of malicious shortcut files and precedes the use of Asruex for evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is about evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which aligns with the use of Asruex for evasion.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification** - This technique involves modifying shortcut files to gain persistence or privilege escalation, which aligns with the initial use of malicious shortcut files.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification** - This technique is similar to the above and involves modifying shortcut files for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software** - This technique is not directly related to the use of malicious shortcut files or evasion techniques.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1648-Serverless Execution** - This technique involves executing code in a serverless environment, which does not directly follow the use of malicious shortcut files or precede the use of Asruex for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which could be a step after gaining initial access but does not directly follow the use of malicious shortcut files or precede the use of Asruex for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate, which is not directly related to the use of malicious shortcut files or evasion techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is that after the use of malicious shortcut files (T1547.009-Shortcut Modification), the next step would be to use a technique that directly follows and precedes the use of Asruex for evasion. The technique that best fits this sequence is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, as it can be used to execute commands that might be necessary to further the attack after gaining initial access and before employing evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
