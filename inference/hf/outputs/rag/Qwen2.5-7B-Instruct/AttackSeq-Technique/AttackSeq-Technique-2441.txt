Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred to deploy the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations before Mustang Panda fetched additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control**
  - **Technique: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for command and control.
  - **Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a target system from an external source.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to C2, it does not directly pertain to the deployment of the PlugX implant.
  
- **Option B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves using scheduled tasks or jobs to execute commands. It is not directly related to the deployment of the PlugX implant or the transfer of tools.

- **Option C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools laterally within a network. It is not directly related to the initial deployment of the PlugX implant.

- **Option D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system from an external source. This aligns well with the scenario where Mustang Panda fetches additional shellcode from a C2 IP address. It is a plausible technique for deploying the PlugX implant before fetching additional shellcode.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the initial deployment of the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations.
- The related TTPs mention T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, which is directly related to transferring tools to a target system from an external source.
- T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant technique for deploying the PlugX implant before fetching additional shellcode.

### Final Answer: D
