### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability via malicious HWP files.
   - The next step in the sequence is to simplify malicious EPS file code to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading** - This technique involves making malicious content appear legitimate to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves using malicious attachments, which aligns with the initial exploitation via HWP files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114-Email Collection** - This technique involves collecting email addresses for targeted attacks. It does not directly relate to simplifying malicious code for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path** - This technique involves exploiting unquoted paths in file system operations. It does not directly relate to simplifying malicious code for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness** - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Registry. It does not directly relate to simplifying malicious code for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While it is related to evasion, it does not specifically address the simplification of malicious code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114-Email Collection** and **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal** are not directly related to the simplification of malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path** and **Answer Choice C: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness** do not align with the context of simplifying malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal** is the closest to the context of evasion but does not specifically address the simplification of malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114-Email Collection** is not relevant to the context of simplifying malicious code.

Given the context of simplifying malicious EPS file code for better evasion, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not directly listed in the choices. However, if we must choose the closest one, **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal** is the most plausible as it involves evasion, which is a key aspect of the question.

### Final Answer: D
