Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The malware installer checks for VM execution during the installation process.
2. After this check, the Iron group used a reflective loader to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory with hardcoded shellcode.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves the malware checking for virtualized environments or sandboxes.
  - **Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves the malware evading detection by virtualized environments or sandboxes.
  - **Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves the malware loading code into memory without using the operating system's loader.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique logically follows the system check (T1497.001-System Checks) and leads to the reflective code loading (T1620-Reflective Code Loading).

- **Option A: T1197-BITS Jobs**
  - This technique is not directly related to the context of the question, as it pertains to using the BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) to transfer files, which is not relevant to the sequence described.

- **Option B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique is directly related to evading detection by virtualized environments or sandboxes. It is a plausible follow-up to the system check (T1497.001-System Checks) because if the malware detects a virtualized environment, it would then attempt to evade detection.

- **Option C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using a web service to communicate with a remote server. It is not directly related to the sequence described, as it does not follow the system check and does not lead to reflective code loading.

- **Option D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This is the same as Option B, and it is a plausible follow-up to the system check (T1497.001-System Checks).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware installer first checks for VM execution (T1497.001-System Checks).
- If the malware detects a virtualized environment, it would then attempt to evade detection (T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion).
- After evading detection, the malware would use a reflective loader to load the Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory (T1620-Reflective Code Loading).

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first checks for VM execution, then evades detection if it detects a virtualized environment, and finally uses a reflective loader to load the beacon.

**Final Answer: D**
