### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where credential access was obtained by decrypting stored Chrome passwords.
   - The next step involves gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes for archiving personal data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Credential Access" and "T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers," which aligns with the initial step of decrypting Chrome passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which does not directly relate to clipboard contents or keystrokes.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment, which is not directly related to clipboard contents or keystrokes.
   - **C: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to clipboard contents or keystrokes.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which directly relates to gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is captured by **T1056-Input Capture** as it directly aligns with the process of gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes for archiving personal data.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
