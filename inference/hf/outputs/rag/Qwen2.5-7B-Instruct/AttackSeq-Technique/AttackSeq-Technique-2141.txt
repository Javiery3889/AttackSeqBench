Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where malware made a POST request to a C2 domain and then transferred additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains. The key points are:
- POST request to a C2 domain.
- Transfer of additional tools or payloads.
- Communication with 13 C2 domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (related to the POST request to the C2 domain)
- Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (related to the transfer of additional tools or payloads)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique is related to using mail protocols for command and control, which does not align with the POST request to a C2 domain mentioned in the question.

- **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
  - This technique is related to authenticating with a domain controller, which is not directly related to the transfer of additional tools or payloads to C2 domains.

- **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique directly aligns with the transfer of additional tools or payloads, which is a key part of the question. It fits well with the context of the related TTPs.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique is related to using phishing to gain access, which does not align with the transfer of additional tools or payloads to C2 domains.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where malware made a POST request to a C2 domain and then transferred additional tools or payloads.
- The related TTPs mention T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, which is directly related to the transfer of additional tools or payloads.
- None of the other techniques (A, B, or D) align as closely with the described sequence of events.

### Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
