### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already used DLL side-loading to execute the PlugX RAT.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which technique is most likely to be used to maintain the malware's presence on the system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" as a tactic and "DLL Side-Loading" as a technique.
   - This indicates that the question is focused on techniques that help the malware persist on the system after initial execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**
     - This technique is related to modifying the Outlook home page to redirect users to malicious websites. It does not directly relate to maintaining persistence on the system.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
     - This technique involves hooking credential APIs to steal credentials. While it can be used for maintaining persistence, it is more focused on stealing credentials rather than ensuring the malware remains on the system.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring the malware runs when the system boots or when a user logs on. This is a common method to maintain persistence, as it ensures the malware remains active even if the system is restarted or the user logs out.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain access. It is more about initial compromise rather than maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique for maintaining the malware's presence on the system after DLL side-loading is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
