Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. LightSpy established execution to install a modular backdoor.
2. The malware then used a Safari bug and a signed Apple developer certificate to maintain evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Resource Development** and **Technique: T1587.004-Exploits** suggest that the malware is developing and using exploits.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion** and **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing** indicate that the malware is using code signing to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it could be part of the backdoor installation, it does not directly address the use of a Safari bug and a signed Apple developer certificate for evasion.

- **B: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**
  - This technique involves manipulating DHCP to redirect traffic. It does not align with the described evasion method using a Safari bug and a signed Apple developer certificate.

- **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which could include using a signed Apple developer certificate to gain trust. However, it does not directly address the use of a Safari bug.

- **D: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique involves reducing the key space to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It does not align with the described evasion method using a Safari bug and a signed Apple developer certificate.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions using a Safari bug and a signed Apple developer certificate for evasion.
- **T1553.002-Code Signing** directly addresses the use of a signed Apple developer certificate to evade detection.
- While **T1587.004-Exploits** is related to the use of a Safari bug, it does not directly address the code signing aspect.

Given the context and the specific techniques mentioned, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
