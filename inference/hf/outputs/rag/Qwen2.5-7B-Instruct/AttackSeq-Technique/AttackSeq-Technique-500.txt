Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. CostaRicto Campaign used defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation.
2. After these techniques, a SombRAT backdoor collected system information as part of the Discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**
  - This technique is not directly related to the process discovery or deobfuscation mentioned in the question. It is more about downgrading security settings, which does not fit the context of the question.

- **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique is directly related to the tactic of Discovery and involves identifying and enumerating processes. Given that the question mentions the SombRAT backdoor collecting system information as part of the Discovery phase, this technique fits well.

- **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - This technique involves using protocols to tunnel data. While it can be used for defense evasion, it is not directly related to the process discovery or deobfuscation mentioned in the question.

- **D: T1087.002-Domain Account**
  - This technique involves using domain accounts for lateral movement or privilege escalation. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about process discovery and deobfuscation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where defense evasion techniques are used, followed by the SombRAT backdoor collecting system information as part of the Discovery phase.
- The related TTPs mention T1057-Process Discovery, which is directly related to the Discovery tactic and involves identifying and enumerating processes.
- The other techniques (T1562.010-Downgrade Attack, T1572-Protocol Tunneling, and T1087.002-Domain Account) do not fit the context as well as T1057-Process Discovery.

### Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
