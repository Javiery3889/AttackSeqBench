### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Hi-Zor RAT to establish persistence and avoid detection.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - Creating a copy of itself with a `.dat` extension.
     - Modifying the registry run key using `regsvr32.exe`.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur as part of its efforts to avoid detection through string-stacking and double XOR encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Defense Evasion** T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.
     - **Privilege Escalation** T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.
     - **Persistence** T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. It does not directly relate to obfuscation or encoding.
   - **T1559-Inter-Process Communication:** This technique involves communication between processes. It does not directly relate to obfuscation or encoding.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. This aligns with the question's mention of string-stacking and double XOR encoding.
   - **T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal:** This technique involves traversing network address translation to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to obfuscation or encoding.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's description of string-stacking and double XOR encoding is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
