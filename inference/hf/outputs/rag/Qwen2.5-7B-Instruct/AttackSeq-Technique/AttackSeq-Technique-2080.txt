Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with "Initial Access" through "Drive-by Compromise" and then executing an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware. We need to identify which technique is most likely to be used to execute this PowerShell script.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves gaining initial access to a system through malvertising or compromised websites.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute code. While it is related to PowerShell, it is not directly about executing a script to fetch malware.
- **Answer Choice B: T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. It is not directly related to executing PowerShell scripts for fetching malware.
- **Answer Choice C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining system or application capabilities. It is not directly about executing a script to fetch malware.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique directly involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts. Given that the question mentions an obfuscated PowerShell script for fetching malware, this technique aligns well with the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with "Initial Access" through "Drive-by Compromise" (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
- After gaining initial access, the next step is to execute a script to fetch malware.
- The technique that best fits executing an obfuscated PowerShell script is T1059.001-PowerShell.

### Final Answer: D: T1059.001-PowerShell
