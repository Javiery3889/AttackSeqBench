### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a spear phishing email containing a malicious macro.
   - After the macro is executed, it downloads and executes malicious files, initiating the infection chain.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Attachment," which align with the initial phase of the attack.
   - The question is asking about the next step after the macro has downloaded and executed malicious files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1569.002-Service Execution**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a service to run at system startup. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the immediate execution of downloaded files.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code or programs in the context of a user. It is a plausible step after the macro has downloaded and executed files, as the next step would likely involve running the downloaded malicious files.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks**
     - This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions or configurations. While it could be a step in the infection chain, it is not directly related to the execution of downloaded files.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed at system boot or logon. While it is a common step in the infection chain, it is more likely to be a later step after the initial execution of the downloaded files.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the macro has downloaded and executed malicious files is **T1204-User Execution**.

**Final Answer: B**
