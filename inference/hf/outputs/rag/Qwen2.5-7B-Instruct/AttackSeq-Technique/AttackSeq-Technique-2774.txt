### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Dragonfly attackers, including reconnaissance methods such as spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial reconnaissance and gaining access to the victim network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Techniques T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment and T1189-Drive-by Compromise are related to gaining initial access to the network.
   - **Reconnaissance:** Technique T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment is related to gathering information, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating user accounts and their attributes. It is typically used after gaining access to the network to understand the network's structure and identify potential targets.
   - **Option B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the reconnaissance phase. It is unlikely to be the next step after gaining access.
   - **Option C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a duplicate of Option B and can be disregarded for the same reason.
   - **Option D: T1585.002-Email Accounts**
     - This technique involves compromising email accounts, which is also a method to gather information and potentially gain further access. However, it is more specific to email accounts and less general than T1087-Account Discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining access to the victim network would be to discover and enumerate accounts to understand the network's structure and identify potential targets.
   - Therefore, the best answer is **T1087-Account Discovery**.

**Final Answer: A: T1087-Account Discovery**
