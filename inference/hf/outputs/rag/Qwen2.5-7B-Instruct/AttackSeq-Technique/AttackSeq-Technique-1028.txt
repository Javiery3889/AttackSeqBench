Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where sensitive documents are scanned from various drives, and then data is exfiltrated to a C&C server. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This is the technique that describes the exfiltration of data.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of sensitive documents.
- **Answer Choice B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting emails from the local system, which is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of sensitive documents.
- **Answer Choice C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to access data, which could be part of the collection process but is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order to intercept file paths, which could be used to collect data from network shared drives or local systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions scanning all drives, including network shares and removable drives, for sensitive documents. This aligns with the collection techniques T1039 and T1005.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1039 (Data from Network Shared Drive) and T1005 (Data from Local System), which are directly related to the collection of data from various sources.
- The exfiltration technique (T1020) is the final step in the sequence, and it is most likely preceded by the collection of data from these sources.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the collection of data from network shared drives and local systems, followed by the exfiltration of that data.

**Final Answer: D (T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking)**

While the question does not directly mention T1574.008, it is a plausible technique that could be used to facilitate the collection of data from network shared drives and local systems. However, the most direct and relevant techniques for collection are T1039 and T1005, which are not among the answer choices. Therefore, the best choice among the given options is D, as it is a technique that could be used to facilitate the collection process.
