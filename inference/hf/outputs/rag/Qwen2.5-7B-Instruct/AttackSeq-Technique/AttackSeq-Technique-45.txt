Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker initiates communication with a C2 server using HTTP connections and specific URIs. The stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, is then transferred to the C2 infrastructure. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely to be used for this data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target network.
- **Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves the attacker impersonating a legitimate protocol or service to establish a foothold.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the attacker transferring data from the target network to the attacker's infrastructure.
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves the attacker using the C2 channel to exfiltrate data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes. While it is relevant to the stolen data (keystrokes), it does not describe the exfiltration of the data.
- **Answer Choice B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not the C2 channel. This does not align with the question, which specifies the use of the C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. While it can be used to gain access, it does not directly describe the exfiltration of data.
- **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique directly describes the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of a C2 server and specific URIs for communication, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- The stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) is then transferred to the C2 infrastructure, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
- The most relevant technique for exfiltrating data over the C2 channel is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

### Final Answer: D
