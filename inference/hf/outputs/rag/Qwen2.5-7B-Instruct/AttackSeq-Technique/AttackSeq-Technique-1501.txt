### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already used obfuscation and sandbox detection to evade defenses.
   - The final step in the sequence is establishing communication with C2 servers using a custom DNS tunneling protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques:
     - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols, which aligns with the custom DNS tunneling protocol mentioned in the question.
     - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for data exfiltration or command and control, which is also relevant to the custom DNS tunneling protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique directly involves using DNS for command and control, which fits the description of using a custom DNS tunneling protocol.
   - **Option B: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**
     - This technique is not related to DNS tunneling or command and control.
   - **Option C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves using one protocol to tunnel another, which aligns with the custom DNS tunneling protocol.
   - **Option D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to obtain credentials or other sensitive information, which does not fit the context of establishing communication with C2 servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both T1071.004-DNS and T1572-Protocol Tunneling are relevant, but T1572-Protocol Tunneling more directly describes the use of a custom DNS tunneling protocol.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1572-Protocol Tunneling.

### Final Answer: C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
