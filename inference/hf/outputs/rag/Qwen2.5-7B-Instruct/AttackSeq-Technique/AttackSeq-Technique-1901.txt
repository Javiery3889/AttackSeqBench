Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Leveraging exposed Weave Scope services for initial access.
2. Executing a coin miner saved as `/usr/sbin/docker-update`.
3. Scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
4. Employing iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1133-External Remote Services
- **Discovery**: T1046-Network Service Discovery
- **Impact**: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

#### A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery
- This TTP is about discovering and interacting with containers and their resources.
- While it might be relevant to the use of Docker, it does not directly align with the scanning for open Docker API endpoints or the use of iplogger.org.

#### B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging
- This TTP is about modifying or clearing command history to avoid detection.
- It does not align with the scanning for open Docker API endpoints or the use of iplogger.org.

#### C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- This TTP involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands.
- The execution of `/usr/sbin/docker-update` as a coin miner aligns with this TTP, as it involves running a command.

#### D: T1007-System Service Discovery
- This TTP is about discovering and enumerating system services.
- Scanning for open Docker API endpoints aligns with this TTP, as it involves discovering services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The use of exposed Weave Scope services for initial access aligns with T1133-External Remote Services.
2. **Discovery**: Scanning for open Docker API endpoints aligns with T1007-System Service Discovery.
3. **Execution**: Executing the coin miner `/usr/sbin/docker-update` aligns with T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
4. **Tracking**: Using iplogger.org to track infected hosts is not directly listed in the provided TTPs but can be inferred as part of the broader impact and persistence strategy.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services)
- Discovery (T1007-System Service Discovery)
- Execution (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter)

The most relevant TTP from the provided choices that aligns with the execution step is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

### Final Answer: C
