### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first gain initial access via spearphishing emails with Excel files.
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of malicious code from the Excel attachment.
   - The final step is ensuring persistence via a scheduled task named 'OfficeServicesStatus.'

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access technique is "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566.001).
   - The technique related to executing malicious code from the Excel attachment is "Exploitation for Client Execution" (T1204.002).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique is about collecting data automatically, which does not align with the execution of malicious code from an Excel file.
   - **Option B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique directly aligns with the execution of malicious code from the Excel attachment, which is a common method for exploiting vulnerabilities in Office documents.
   - **Option C: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
     - This technique involves malicious links, which is not the method described in the question (Excel files).
   - **Option D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is about delivering malicious content via email, which is the initial access method, not the execution of the malicious code.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access via spearphishing emails with Excel files, the attackers would use "Exploitation for Client Execution" to execute the malicious code from the Excel attachment.

**Final Answer: B**
