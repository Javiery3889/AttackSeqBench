### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have achieved persistence by creating a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image'.
   - The next step in the sequence is the communication of a PlugX variant with its C2 domains using various ports (80, 443, 53, and 8000) over TCP and UDP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1571-Non-Standard Port".
   - T1571-Non-Standard Port is a technique that involves using non-standard ports for command and control communication to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**
     - This technique involves hiding files and directories to avoid detection. While it is a common technique, it does not directly relate to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
   - **Option B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. Similar to Option A, it does not directly relate to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
   - **Option C: T1070.005-Network Share Connection Removal**
     - This technique involves removing network share connections to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
   - **Option D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using a web service to establish a command and control channel. While it can be used for C2 communication, it does not specifically address the use of non-standard ports, which is a key aspect of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of using non-standard ports for C2 communication, is the technique that directly addresses this aspect.
   - **Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service** (Although it does not specifically mention non-standard ports, it is the closest match among the given options for establishing a web service for C2 communication.)

However, considering the specific mention of non-standard ports in the question and the related TTPs, the most accurate answer would be a technique that directly involves the use of non-standard ports. Since none of the provided options explicitly mention non-standard ports, the best fit is:

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service** (with the understanding that it may not directly address the use of non-standard ports, but it is the closest match among the given options.)
