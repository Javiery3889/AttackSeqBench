Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where API hooking is used to evade detection. After this, the next steps are establishing communication with the C&C server and loading incoming executables. We need to identify which TTP occurred before these steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which aligns with the use of API hooking to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code, which can be a method to load incoming executables.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C&C server, which is a step after establishing communication, not before.
- **Answer Choice B: T1586.003-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves using cloud accounts for command and control, which is also a step after establishing communication.
- **Answer Choice C: T1569.002-Service Execution**: This technique involves executing code in a service, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code, which is a plausible step before loading incoming executables.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where API hooking is used to evade detection, followed by establishing communication with the C&C server and loading incoming executables.
- The related TTPs mention T1106-Native API, which aligns with the use of API hooking.
- T1129-Shared Modules is a technique that involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code, which is a logical step before loading incoming executables.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurred before establishing communication with the C&C server and loading incoming executables is T1129-Shared Modules.

**Final Answer: D**
