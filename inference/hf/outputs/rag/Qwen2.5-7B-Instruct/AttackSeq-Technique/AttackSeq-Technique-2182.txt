### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Taidoor malware, including the execution of a small executable file and modifying the Windows Registry to enable attacker operations.
   - The core of the question is to identify which ATT&CK technique enables the malware to maintain persistence on infected systems through automated actions during boot or logon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques under the Persistence tactic:
     - **T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts:** This technique involves the use of scripts that run during the boot process or logon to execute malicious code.
     - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves adding files to locations that are automatically executed when a user logs on or the system boots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique is not directly related to maintaining persistence on a single infected system but rather involves authentication mechanisms on domain controllers. It does not fit the context of the question.
   - **Option B: T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts**
     - This technique involves scripts that run during boot or logon, which aligns with the requirement to maintain persistence through automated actions. However, the question specifically mentions modifying the Windows Registry, which is more closely associated with T1547.
   - **Option C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves adding files to autostart locations, which directly aligns with the requirement to maintain persistence through automated actions during boot or logon. The modification of the Windows Registry to enable autostart execution is a common method to achieve persistence.
   - **Option D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
     - This technique involves methods for processes to communicate with each other, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence through boot or logon actions.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that enables the malware to maintain persistence on infected systems through automated actions during boot or logon is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: C**
