### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Suckfly uses a backdoor (Nidiran) and signed hacktools to infect internal hosts.
   - The sequence then moves to scanning for open ports to expand the foothold.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically occurs between the infection and the port scanning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," which aligns with the need to gather information about the network.
   - The related technique is "T1046-Network Service Discovery," which involves identifying network services and their associated ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**:
     - This technique is about discovering cloud services, which is not directly related to the internal network scanning described.
   - **B: T1552.008-Chat Messages**:
     - This technique involves using chat messages for command and control, which is not directly related to the network scanning process.
   - **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**:
     - This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which could be a step after infection but not necessarily before port scanning.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**:
     - This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which is more about securing communication rather than discovering open ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is "T1046-Network Service Discovery," as it directly relates to the scanning of the internal network for open ports to expand the foothold.

### Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

**Note:** While T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) is a plausible technique that could occur after the initial infection, it is not the most direct or logical step in the sequence described. The most direct step would be T1046 (Network Service Discovery) as it aligns with the need to scan for open ports. However, based on the given choices and the need to fit the sequence, T1003 is the closest match.
