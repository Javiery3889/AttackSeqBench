Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Persistence is established through registry key modifications and DLL injection into explorer.exe.
2. T9000 (a technique for stealing files of specific types stored on removable media) is used.
3. After stealing the files, another technique is applied.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1074-Data Staged**
- This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration or use. While it could be a plausible next step, it doesn't directly follow the stealing of files from removable media.

**B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
- This technique involves accessing data from removable media. However, the question already states that files were stolen from removable media, so this would be redundant.

**C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
- This technique involves using an encrypted channel to exfiltrate or transfer data. While it could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly follow the stealing of files.

**D: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**
- This technique involves injecting code into an image file to execute it. Given that persistence was established through DLL injection into explorer.exe, it is plausible that the next step would be to use a similar method to execute the stolen files or to further spread the malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence through DLL injection and the stealing of files from removable media.
- The next logical step would be to use a similar method to execute the stolen files or to further spread the malware.
- T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection aligns well with the described persistence method and the need to execute the stolen files.

**Final Answer: D**
