Let's break down the question and the related TTPs to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Public exploits (e.g., CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) are deployed to vulnerable systems.
2. APT29 maintains persistent access.
3. APT29 obtains legitimate credentials.
4. APT29 uses anonymizing services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** T1078-Valid Accounts
- **Persistence (Tactic):** T1078-Valid Accounts

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before APT29 maintained persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and using anonymizing services.

- **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity (A):** This technique involves using multiple identities to blend in with legitimate users. It is more about maintaining persistence and evading detection rather than the initial steps.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel (B):** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain communication. It is more about securing the communication channel rather than the initial access or credential theft.
- **T1659-Content Injection (C):** This technique involves injecting content into web pages. It is not directly related to the initial access or credential theft.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts (D):** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access. It is directly related to obtaining legitimate credentials, which is a step before maintaining persistent access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This is the first step where APT29 deploys public exploits to vulnerable systems.
2. **T1078-Valid Accounts (D):** After gaining initial access, APT29 likely uses valid accounts to maintain persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials.
3. **Defense Evasion (T1078-Valid Accounts):** This technique is also listed under defense evasion, which aligns with the use of valid accounts to evade detection.
4. **Persistence (T1078-Valid Accounts):** Finally, APT29 uses the obtained valid accounts to maintain persistent access.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurred before APT29 maintained persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials is T1078-Valid Accounts.

### Final Answer: D
