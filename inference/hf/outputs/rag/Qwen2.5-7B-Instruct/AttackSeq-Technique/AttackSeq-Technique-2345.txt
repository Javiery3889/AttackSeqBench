Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools and utilized PRC-linked infrastructure. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development** - This suggests that BRONZE PRESIDENT was developing its own tools and infrastructure.
- **Technique: T1588.002-Tool** - This is related to the development and use of custom tools.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using malicious content to lure victims into providing sensitive information. It doesn't directly relate to the development and use of custom tools.
- **B: T1606.001-Web Cookies** - This technique involves the use of web cookies for tracking or persistence. It is not directly related to the development and use of custom tools.
- **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain** - This technique involves compromising software supply chains to inject malicious code. While it can be used to distribute custom tools, it is not the most direct precursor to using custom tools.
- **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities** - This technique involves obtaining the ability to perform a specific action, which can include developing and using custom tools. It aligns well with the context of BRONZE PRESIDENT developing its own tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes BRONZE PRESIDENT developing its own remote access tools and utilizing PRC-linked infrastructure.
- The related TTPs mention Resource Development and the use of custom tools.
- Among the answer choices, T1588-Obtain Capabilities (D) is the most relevant because it directly aligns with the development and use of custom tools, which is a precursor to using tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.

### Final Answer: D
