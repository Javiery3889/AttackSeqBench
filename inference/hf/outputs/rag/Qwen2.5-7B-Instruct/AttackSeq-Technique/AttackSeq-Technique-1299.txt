Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware collected stored passwords and access tokens from the registry.
2. An exploit using CVE-2017-11882 was executed.
3. The malware removed forensic evidence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.002-Credentials in Registry** - This technique is relevant as it involves accessing credentials stored in the registry.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** - This technique is relevant as it involves exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to execute code.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry** - This technique is relevant as it involves modifying the registry to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves using legitimate credentials to execute code. While it is related to execution, it does not directly address the removal of forensic evidence.
- **Answer Choice B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking** - This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to load malicious code. It is not directly related to removing forensic evidence.
- **Answer Choice C: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching** - This technique involves using sudo and sudo caching to gain elevated privileges. It is not directly related to removing forensic evidence.
- **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of compromise. It aligns well with the removal of forensic evidence after the execution of the exploit.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware first collected credentials from the registry (T1552.002).
- It then executed an exploit (T1203) using CVE-2017-11882.
- After execution, the malware removed forensic evidence (T1070).

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the removal of forensic evidence, which aligns with the technique T1070-Indicator Removal.

**Final Answer: D**
