### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already achieved lateral movement using vulnerabilities like MS08-067 and MS10-061.
   - The next step in the sequence is to send data and receive commands or updates from predefined URLs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to move laterally within a network. It aligns with the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061).
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or payloads to other systems within the network to maintain persistence or further the attack. However, it does not directly address the communication with predefined URLs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1608.002-Upload Tool:** This technique involves uploading tools to a remote system. While it is related to transferring tools, it does not directly address the communication with predefined URLs.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly address the communication with predefined URLs.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or receive commands. This aligns well with the question's requirement to send data and receive commands or updates from predefined URLs.
   - **D: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating a protocol or service to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly address the communication with predefined URLs.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's requirement to send data and receive commands or updates from predefined URLs is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
