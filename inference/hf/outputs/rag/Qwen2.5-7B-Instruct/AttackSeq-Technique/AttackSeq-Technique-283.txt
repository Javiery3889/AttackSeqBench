### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading to the exploitation of MS Word documents via spear-phishing, which is a form of Initial Access.
   - After gathering information through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, the next step is to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.
     - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This is a specific type of spear-phishing where the attacker uses a link to deliver the payload.
     - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This is a specific type of spear-phishing where the attacker uses an attachment to deliver the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1199-Trusted Relationship:** This technique involves leveraging a trusted relationship to gain access. It does not directly follow spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it could be used after gaining access, it does not directly follow the spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **C: T1593.003-Code Repositories:** This technique involves using code repositories to host malicious code. It is not directly related to the spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad technique that includes both spear-phishing links and attachments. Given that the question mentions spear-phishing using MS Word documents, T1566 is the most relevant.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, is that the next step would be to use the phishing technique to deliver the payload.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: T1566-Phishing.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
