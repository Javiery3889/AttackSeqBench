Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tropic Trooper's backdoor decrypted its configuration file.
2. The backdoor connected using the SSL protocol.
3. The backdoor leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

We need to identify which TTP occurred before the backdoor used custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control.
- T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation: This technique involves impersonating a legitimate protocol or service.
- T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware. It does not directly relate to the use of SSL or custom SSL libraries for secure communication.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels for command and control. While it is related to secure communication, it does not specifically mention the use of custom SSL libraries.

- **C: T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. It does not directly relate to the use of SSL or custom SSL libraries for secure communication.

- **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to deliver malware. It does not directly relate to the use of SSL or custom SSL libraries for secure communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the backdoor uses custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server. This implies that the backdoor must first establish a connection and then use custom SSL libraries for secure communication.
- The related TTPs suggest that the backdoor might have used a technique to establish a connection before using custom SSL libraries. T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation are more relevant to the use of web protocols and impersonating legitimate protocols or services, which could be a precursor to using custom SSL libraries.
- T1571-Non-Standard Port is also relevant as it involves using non-standard ports, which could be a method to establish a connection before using custom SSL libraries.

Given the context, the most plausible TTP that would occur before leveraging custom SSL libraries is T1071.001-Web Protocols, as it involves the use of web protocols, which could be a method to establish a connection before using custom SSL libraries.

### Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel

However, upon re-evaluation, the most plausible TTP that aligns with the sequence described in the question is T1071.001-Web Protocols, as it directly relates to the use of web protocols, which could be a method to establish a connection before using custom SSL libraries.

### Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel (Revised to align with the most plausible sequence)
