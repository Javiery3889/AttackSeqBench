### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving obfuscation and padding to evade detection.
   - The final step in the sequence is facilitating communications between the attacker and compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.001-Binary Padding:** This technique involves padding the LNK file with NOP bytes to evade detection. This aligns with the question's description of padding the LNK file.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear legitimate to evade detection. While it is related to the initial steps, it does not directly address the final step of facilitating communications.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves removing obfuscation to access the true content of files or information. This is related to the initial obfuscation but does not directly address the final step of facilitating communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique is related to the initial obfuscation but does not directly address the final step of facilitating communications.
   - **B: T1021.008-Direct Cloud VM Connections:** This technique involves establishing a direct connection to a cloud-based virtual machine. While it could be a method of communication, it does not directly align with the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting:** This technique involves using a legitimate domain to mask the true destination of a request, often used to bypass network security controls. This aligns well with the need to facilitate communications while evading detection.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the attacker. While it is a method of communication, it does not directly align with the sequence of TTPs described.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described in the question, is facilitated by **T1090.004-Domain Fronting**. This technique aligns well with the need to establish communications while evading detection, which is consistent with the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**
