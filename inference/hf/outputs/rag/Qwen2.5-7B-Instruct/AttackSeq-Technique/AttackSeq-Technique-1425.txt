### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware (Alchimist) establishes Initial Access using port-bound remote shell backdoors.
   - The sequence continues with the use of persistence agents, but before malware like Gimmick or macOS.Macma, which also use similarly labeled persistence agents.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows Initial Access and precedes the use of persistence agents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique involves using a launch agent to ensure a malware payload is executed at system boot or logon.
   - **T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification:** This technique involves modifying shell configuration files to ensure a payload is executed.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves creating or modifying files that are executed at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique is about altering the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to establishing persistence.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a supply chain to deliver malware. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **T1546-Event Triggered Execution:** This technique involves using events to trigger the execution of a payload. While it can be a form of persistence, it is not the most direct or common method for establishing persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique directly involves creating or modifying files to ensure a payload is executed at boot or logon, which is a common method for persistence.

### Final Answer:
The technique that most likely occurred after establishing Initial Access using port-bound remote shell backdoors and before the use of persistence agents is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
