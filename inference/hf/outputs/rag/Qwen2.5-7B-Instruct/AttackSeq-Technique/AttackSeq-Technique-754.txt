### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a NewPass agent has established communication with a command-and-control (C2) server using stealthy POST requests and encryption.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1071.001-Web Protocols."
   - T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of POST requests and encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel. Given that the NewPass agent has already established a C2 channel using stealthy POST requests and encryption, this technique could logically follow.
   - **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. While it is related to web protocols, it does not specifically mention the C2 channel, which is the focus of the question.
   - **C: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**
     - This technique involves adding a loadable code library to a process. It does not directly relate to the communication or exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication. While this is relevant to the initial communication, the question asks for what occurred after the initial communication, so this is less likely to be the correct answer.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the NewPass agent established communication with the C2 server using stealthy POST requests and encryption, the next step would be to exfiltrate data over that established C2 channel. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
