### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlueBravo's malware has already used defense evasion techniques (HTML smuggling and DLL search order hijacking).
   - The next step in the sequence is gathering system information, specifically the username and a list of running processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is the context of the initial techniques used (HTML smuggling and DLL search order hijacking).
   - **Tactic: Discovery** - This is the context of the next step (gathering system information).
   - **Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking** - This is a specific defense evasion technique.
   - **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery** - This is a technique for discovering processes, which aligns with the question's requirement to gather a list of running processes.
   - **Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** - This is a technique for discovering system owners or users, which aligns with the requirement to gather the username.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1057-Process Discovery** - This technique directly aligns with the requirement to gather a list of running processes.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding** - This technique is about encoding data, which is not directly related to the task of gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1135-Network Share Discovery** - This technique is about discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the task of gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure** - This technique is about compromising infrastructure, which is not directly related to the task of gathering system information.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that the malware would engage in **T1057-Process Discovery** before gathering the system information including the username and a list of running processes.

**Final Answer: A: T1057-Process Discovery**
