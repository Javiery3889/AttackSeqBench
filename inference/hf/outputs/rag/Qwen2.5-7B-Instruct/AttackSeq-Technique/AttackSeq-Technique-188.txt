Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where:
1. Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collected files from the local system and data directories.
2. It also enumerated multiple data directories to collect GPS and hardware information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1119-Automated Collection

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the described sequence of actions.

- **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
  - This technique involves using cloud services to store or exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to the described actions of collecting and enumerating local system data.

- **B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the described actions of collecting and enumerating local system data.

- **C: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
  - This technique involves using a network provider DLL to modify network traffic. It is not directly related to the described actions of collecting and enumerating local system data.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system, including hardware and software details. This aligns well with the described actions of collecting GPS and hardware information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the collection of files and data directories, which aligns with T1005-Data from Local System.
- The enumeration of multiple data directories to collect GPS and hardware information aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery.
- The related TTPs, T1119-Automated Collection, suggest that the collection process is automated, which fits with the described actions.

Given the described sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1005-Data from Local System followed by T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
