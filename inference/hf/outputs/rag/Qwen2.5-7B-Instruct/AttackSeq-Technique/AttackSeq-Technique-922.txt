Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Vulnerability scans are conducted to identify exploitable web servers.
2. An Explosive Trojan is used for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after the initial vulnerability scans.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Reconnaissance**: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting a service to gain access to a system. While it is related to exploiting services, it does not directly address the spread of the malware into the network.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain access to a system. Given that the question mentions vulnerability scans and the use of an Explosive Trojan, this technique aligns well with the context of exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access and spread further.

- **C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying**
  - This technique involves using environmental information to key the behavior of malware. It does not directly relate to the spread of malware through network exploitation.

- **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. While it is a valid technique, the question does not mention the use of removable media, and the context is more about network-based exploitation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where vulnerability scans are conducted, and then an Explosive Trojan is used for remote execution. This indicates that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is relevant to the context of gaining initial access.
- The Explosive Trojan and the use of dynamically loaded DLL components suggest that the malware is spreading further into the network after gaining initial access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
