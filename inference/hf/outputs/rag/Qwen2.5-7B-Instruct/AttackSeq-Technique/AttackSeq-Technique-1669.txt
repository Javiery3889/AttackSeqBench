### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the SocGholish framework is used to initiate the attack via compromised legitimate websites.
   - The next step in the sequence is the deployment of the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** The attack starts with the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Command and Control (Tactic):** The next step involves the deployment of the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to the delivery of the payload via a compromised website.
   - **Option B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which is not directly related to the initial access or the deployment of the payload.
   - **Option C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. While it is related to initial access, it does not fit the context of the attack sequence described, as the question specifies the use of compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Option D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
     - This technique involves using resource forks to hide or obfuscate files. Given that the attack uses a compromised legitimate website to deliver the SocGholish framework, it is plausible that the attackers might use resource forking to hide or obfuscate the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload before execution.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1564.009-Resource Forking
