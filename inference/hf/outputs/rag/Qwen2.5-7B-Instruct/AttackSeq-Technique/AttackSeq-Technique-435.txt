### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Sednit group uses a Delphi downloader to execute a process (`cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`) to gather initial information.
   - After this initial information gathering, the next step involves gathering more detailed information using WMI objects and other reconnaissance techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," and the technique is "T1082-System Information Discovery."
   - This indicates that the next step involves discovering more detailed system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1037.005-Startup Items**
     - This technique involves adding or modifying startup items to ensure persistence. It does not directly relate to the detailed system information gathering described.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering information to find running processes. While it is related to system information, it is more specific to process discovery rather than the broad system information gathering described.
   - **C: T1597-Search Closed Sources**
     - This technique involves searching for information in closed or hidden sources. It is not directly related to the system information gathering described.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the system owner or user. While it is related to system information, it is more specific to discovering the user rather than the broad system information gathering described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of gathering detailed system information, is **T1082-System Information Discovery** followed by a technique that further details the system information. Among the given choices, **T1057-Process Discovery** (B) is the most relevant as it fits within the broader context of system information discovery and is a natural progression from the initial `SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST` command.

### Final Answer: B
