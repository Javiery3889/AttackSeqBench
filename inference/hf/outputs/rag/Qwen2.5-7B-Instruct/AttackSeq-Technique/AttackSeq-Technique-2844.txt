Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware sent system information to an IP address '45.124.132.127'.
2. The communication with the C2 server leverages HTTPS with a POST method.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

**A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
- This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate data. It does not specifically mention HTTPS or POST methods, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.

**B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. T1071.001-Web Protocols is a sub-technique of T1071, which specifically mentions using web protocols (like HTTPS) for C2 communication. This aligns well with the question's description of using HTTPS with a POST method.

**C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
- This technique involves deploying software to systems. It does not relate to the communication aspect described in the question, so it is not a plausible answer.

**D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
- This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state. It does not relate to the communication aspect described in the question, so it is not a plausible answer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a C2 communication leveraging HTTPS with a POST method.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a sub-technique of T1071 and specifically mentions using web protocols for C2 communication.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B) is the most relevant and aligns with the described communication method.

**Final Answer: B**
