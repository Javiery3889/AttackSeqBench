### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Duke group initially gains access via 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails.
   - The next step in the sequence is the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Lateral Movement" and "Defense Evasion" tactics, with the specific technique being "T1550.003-Pass the Ticket."
   - This indicates that the next step after gaining initial access is likely to be moving laterally within the network and potentially evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading** - This technique involves impersonating a legitimate user or system. While it could be used for lateral movement, it is not directly related to the credential access via Kerberos pass-the-ticket.
   - **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. It is more related to data exfiltration rather than the immediate next step after gaining access.
   - **C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager** - This technique involves manipulating the .NET AppDomain to execute arbitrary code. It is not directly related to the credential access via Kerberos pass-the-ticket.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It aligns well with the tactic of Defense Evasion and could be a step taken before or during the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket for credential access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Duke group would use a technique to hide their artifacts (T1564-Hide Artifacts) before leveraging Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
