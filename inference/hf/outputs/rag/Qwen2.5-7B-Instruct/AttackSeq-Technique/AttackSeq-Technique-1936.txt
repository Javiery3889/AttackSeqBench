To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where Smooth Operator malware is executed by creating a new thread and initiating via a constructor function within the 3CX software's malicious dylib. This indicates that the malware is leveraging a specific execution method within the software.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking**: This technique involves executing code in a thread that is not the main thread of the process. This aligns with the description of creating a new thread and initiating via a constructor function.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process, which can be a method to execute code within a legitimate application.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malicious code. While it can be a method to deliver malware, it does not directly describe the execution method via a new thread and constructor function.
- **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**: This is a sub-technique of T1195 and involves compromising software dependencies or development tools. It does not directly describe the execution method via a new thread and constructor function.
- **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. It does not describe the execution method via a new thread and constructor function.
- **D: T1651-Cloud Administration Command**: This technique involves using cloud services for command and control. It does not describe the execution method via a new thread and constructor function.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific execution method (creating a new thread and initiating via a constructor function).
- The related TTPs, T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, are more directly related to the described execution method.
- T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking specifically mentions executing code in a thread, which aligns with the question's description of creating a new thread and initiating via a constructor function.

### Final Answer: A: T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking
