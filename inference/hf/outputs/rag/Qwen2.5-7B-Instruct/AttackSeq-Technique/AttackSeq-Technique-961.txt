### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a batch script is used to deploy the RMS client via a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX).
   - The goal is to maintain the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique is about deleting files to avoid detection, which is not directly related to maintaining attack presence through startup configurations.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to add entries that run programs at startup, which is a method to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves adding files to the startup folder or modifying the Windows Registry to ensure that malware runs when the system boots or a user logs on.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page or drive-by download. It does not directly relate to modifying system startup configurations.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique directly involves adding files to the startup folder or modifying the Windows Registry to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon, which aligns with the goal of maintaining attack presence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves exploiting unquoted paths in system configurations to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly relate to maintaining attack presence through startup configurations.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file. It does not directly relate to maintaining attack presence through startup configurations.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the goal of maintaining attack presence by modifying system startup configurations is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: B
