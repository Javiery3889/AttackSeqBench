Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. FIN13 conducted reconnaissance.
2. They mapped the victim networks.
3. They captured credentials.
4. They executed commands locally using JSPRAT.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network services.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before executing commands locally using JSPRAT.

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**: This technique involves using a network provider DLL, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts, which is a plausible step before executing commands locally.
- **D: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is a step in the sequence but not necessarily before executing commands locally.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials) is the first step, where credentials are gathered.
- **Step 2**: Network mapping (implied by T1046-Network Service Discovery) is the next step, where the network is explored.
- **Step 3**: Using local accounts (T1078.003-Local Accounts) is the step that follows, providing a foothold on the network.
- **Step 4**: Executing commands locally using JSPRAT is the final step.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before executing commands locally using JSPRAT is T1078.003-Local Accounts.

### Final Answer: C
