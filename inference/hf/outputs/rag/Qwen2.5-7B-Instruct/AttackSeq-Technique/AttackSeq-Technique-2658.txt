Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Korplug variant collects system information after a custom loader executes the Korplug file in memory by exploiting a side-loading vulnerability. We need to identify which technique occurred immediately after the custom loader executed the Korplug file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** - This technique describes the method used to load a malicious DLL into memory, which aligns with the custom loader executing the Korplug file.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the Korplug variant collecting system information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery** - This technique is about discovering cloud services, which does not align with the context of the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering system information, which aligns with the Korplug variant's behavior.
- **Answer Choice D: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL** - This technique involves using a network provider DLL, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The custom loader executing the Korplug file in memory by exploiting a side-loading vulnerability (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) is the initial step.
- The next step would be to gather system information, which is described by the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the custom loader executed the Korplug file, the next step was to gather system information.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
