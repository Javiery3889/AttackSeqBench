### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT used digital certificates to sign their backdoors, which is a form of code signing (T1553.002-Code Signing).
   - The next step in the sequence involves encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Defense Evasion," which aligns with the need to bypass defenses.
   - The technique "T1553.002-Code Signing" is directly related to the use of digital certificates to sign backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to load malicious code. It does not directly relate to encryption or storing data in log files.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While it is a form of defense evasion, it does not align with the encryption and storage of data in log files.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to inject malicious code. It does not directly relate to encryption or storing data in log files.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It can include hiding files, processes, and network connections. While it is a form of defense evasion, it can also involve hiding the encrypted data stored in log files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of encryption and storage of data in log files, is best represented by **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique can be used to hide the encrypted data stored in log files, making it difficult for defenders to detect and analyze the data.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
