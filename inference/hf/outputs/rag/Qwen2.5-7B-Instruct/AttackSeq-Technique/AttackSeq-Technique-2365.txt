Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through spear-phishing attacks. Specifically, it mentions that MuddyWater processes requests between clients and C2 server to support payload delivery and information collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access**: The tactic is about gaining access to the target environment.
- **Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This is a specific method of initial access through a malicious link in a spear-phishing email.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that describes the processing of requests between clients and C2 servers, which supports payload delivery and information collection.

- **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, which is not directly related to processing requests or payload delivery.
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is a broader technique that includes spear-phishing, but it does not specifically describe the processing of requests or payload delivery.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or deliver payloads. It aligns well with the processing of requests between clients and C2 servers.
- **D: T1584.006-Web Services**: This technique involves using web services to exfiltrate data or deliver payloads. It also aligns with the processing of requests between clients and C2 servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the TTPs are related to processing requests between clients and C2 servers, which supports payload delivery and information collection.
- Both T1071-Application Layer Protocol and T1584.006-Web Services are relevant, but T1071 is more general and can encompass a broader range of application layer protocols, including web services.
- Given the context of the question, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most comprehensive and directly relevant to the described scenario.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
