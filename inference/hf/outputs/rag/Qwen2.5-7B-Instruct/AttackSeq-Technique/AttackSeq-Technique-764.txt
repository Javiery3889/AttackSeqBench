### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Derusbi server variant installs itself as a service using the `DllRegisterServer` function and then begins its startup sequence.
   - The key points are:
     - Persistence is established.
     - The installation is done through the `DllRegisterServer` function.
     - The variant executes as a service and starts its sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" and "Windows Service" (T1543.003).
   - T1543.003 specifically refers to creating a Windows service to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves installing a service, which aligns with the scenario. However, it is more general and does not specifically mention the `DllRegisterServer` function.
   - **B: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a system process, which is not directly related to installing a service.
   - **C: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code, which is not directly related to installing a service.
   - **D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run at startup, which is not directly related to installing a service.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1543.003, which specifically mentions creating a Windows service.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is A: T1569-System Services, as it is the closest match to the described scenario of installing a service.

### Final Answer: A: T1569-System Services
