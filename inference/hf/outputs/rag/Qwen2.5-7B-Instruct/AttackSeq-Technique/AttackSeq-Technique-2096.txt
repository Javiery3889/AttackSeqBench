### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network.
   - The Carbanak group is known for its sophisticated cyber-attacks, often involving the use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the Tactic of "Discovery" and the Techniques of "T1018-Remote System Discovery" and "T1046-Network Service Discovery."
   - These techniques are used to gather information about the target network, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications. While it could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly follow the initial network mapping and discovery.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services for malicious purposes. It is not directly related to the initial network mapping and discovery phase.
   - **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems within the network. Given that the initial phase involves mapping the network, the next logical step would be to move laterally to other systems.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
     - This technique involves determining the physical locations of assets. While it could be relevant, it is not as directly related to the network mapping and discovery phase as lateral movement.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial network mapping and discovery would be the lateral movement of tools or malware to other systems within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
