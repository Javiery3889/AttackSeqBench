Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The malware gathers system information.
2. The results are sent to a C&C server.
3. Communication is established using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols to establish a command and control channel.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the browser to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one is detected or blocked.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1136.003-Cloud Account**: This technique involves using cloud services to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to establishing a command and control channel using a web protocol.
- **Answer Choice B: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves using a sequence of packets to establish a connection. It does not directly relate to using web protocols or mimicking a browser.
- **Answer Choice C: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to evade detection. It does not directly relate to establishing a command and control channel using a web protocol.
- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a command and control channel. It aligns well with the description of using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser, which is a web protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser to establish communication with the C&C server. This aligns with the use of web protocols for command and control.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1071.001-Web Protocols, directly support the use of web protocols for command and control.
- None of the other answer choices (T1136.003, T1205.001, or T1211) directly relate to using web protocols for command and control.

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
