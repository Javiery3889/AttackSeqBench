### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already modified open-source hacking tools for defense evasion and is using Backdoor.Pirpi to maintain a presence on the network.
   - The next step in the sequence is to gather credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** The attacker is using Backdoor.Pirpi to maintain a presence, which is a form of defense evasion.
   - **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** The attacker is gathering credentials, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - **Credential Access (Tactic):** The specific technique mentioned is T1003-OS Credential Dumping, which involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to gathering credentials.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves modifying authentication mechanisms, which is more about changing how authentication works rather than directly gathering credentials.
   - **C: T1110.003-Password Spraying:** This technique involves attempting to log in using a list of common passwords, which is a method of credential gathering.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing credentials, which is also a method of credential gathering.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique for gathering credentials is T1110.003-Password Spraying, as it directly involves attempting to log in using a list of common passwords, which is a common method of credential gathering.
   - Additionally, T1003-OS Credential Dumping is also a strong candidate, but it is more about extracting existing credentials rather than attempting to gather them through a list of passwords.

### Final Answer: C: T1110.003-Password Spraying
