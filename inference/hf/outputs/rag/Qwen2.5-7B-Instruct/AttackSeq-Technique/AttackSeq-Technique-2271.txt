Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Cosmic Banker malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to retrieve contacts' email accounts before exfiltrating them. The final step is a POST web request for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Collection" and the techniques are:
- T1114-Email Collection
- T1114.001-Local Email Collection

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email addresses from various sources, which aligns with the question's requirement to access and retrieve email accounts.
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This is a sub-technique of T1114, specifically focusing on collecting email addresses from local sources, which also aligns with the question's requirement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the technique used to access Microsoft Outlook MAPI and retrieve contacts' email accounts.
- Both T1114 and T1114.001 are relevant to collecting email addresses, but T1114.001 is more specific to local sources, which aligns well with accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI.
- The other options (T1614.001, T1589, and T1557.004) do not directly relate to the collection of email addresses from Microsoft Outlook MAPI.

### Final Answer: D: T1114.001-Local Email Collection
