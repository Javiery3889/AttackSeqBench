Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Machete collected and staged encrypted logs and files in a temporary directory.
2. The next step is to facilitate communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves collecting data from remote systems and staging it locally.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for command and control (C&C) communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves discovering and using peripheral devices for data exfiltration. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
- **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly facilitate communication with C&C servers.
- **Answer Choice C: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like FTP and HTTP) for communication. This aligns well with the described sequence of actions, as it directly facilitates communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the collection and staging of data in a temporary directory, which aligns with T1074.002-Remote Data Staging.
- The next step is to facilitate communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports. This aligns with T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves using application layer protocols for communication.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol, further support the use of application layer protocols for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
