### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the IEXPL0RE RAT communicated with the C2 server using HTTP POST and GET methods with encrypted communication.
   - The communication method (HTTP POST and GET with encrypted communication) suggests that the malware is using web protocols for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Command and Control" and "T1071.001-Web Protocols."
   - T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the HTTP POST and GET methods used by the IEXPL0RE RAT.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious process. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the web protocol communication.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on the system. It is not directly related to the web protocol communication.
   - **C: T1071.004-DNS** - This technique involves using DNS for command and control. While DNS can be used for C2, the question specifies HTTP POST and GET, which are web protocols, not DNS.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. T1071.001-Web Protocols is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically for web protocols, which aligns with the HTTP POST and GET methods.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that the malware first used a technique to establish or maintain a foothold using web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) before communicating with the C2 server using HTTP POST and GET methods with encrypted communication.

**Final Answer: D**
