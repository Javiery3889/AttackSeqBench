### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where MSSQL Server processes are discovered through the Inner-Loader component.
   - The goal is to bypass authentication and maintain stealth against logging mechanisms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control (UAC)**
     - This technique is about bypassing UAC to gain higher privileges, which is not directly related to bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth against logging.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
     - This technique involves modifying the authentication process to avoid detection or to gain unauthorized access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
     - This technique is also about modifying the authentication process, which aligns with the goal of bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1548.001-Setuid and Setgid**
     - This technique is about setting the setuid and setgid bits to gain elevated privileges, which is more about privilege escalation rather than bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process, which can be used for various purposes but is not specifically about bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
     - This technique directly involves modifying the authentication process, which aligns with the goal of bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1127.001-MSBuild**
     - This technique involves using MSBuild to execute arbitrary code, which is more about code execution rather than bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the goal of bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth against logging mechanisms is **T1556-Modify Authentication Process**.

Final Answer: C
