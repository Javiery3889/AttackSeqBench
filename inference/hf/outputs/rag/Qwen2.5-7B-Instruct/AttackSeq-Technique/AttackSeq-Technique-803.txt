Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A JavaScript file creates an executable file named 'd3reEW.exe'.
2. The executable file uses the command `cmd /c ipconfig` to discover IP address information.

The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control (C&C) channel. However, the question does not mention any specific application layer protocol being used for communication. It focuses on the discovery of IP addresses.

- **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to run at a later time. The question does not mention any scheduled tasks or jobs being created or modified. It focuses on the discovery of IP addresses.

- **C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. The question does not mention any proxy being used. It focuses on the discovery of IP addresses.

- **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering internet connections and network services. The question mentions the discovery of IP addresses using the `ipconfig` command, which is a part of the T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery technique. However, T1016 is more about discovering network configurations, and T1016.001 is a sub-technique that specifically deals with discovering internet connections. This sub-technique could be used to identify the necessary internet connection to establish HTTPS communication with the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the discovery of IP addresses, which aligns with the T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery technique.
- The sub-technique T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery is more specific to identifying internet connections, which is necessary for establishing HTTPS communication with the C&C server.
- The other answer choices do not align as closely with the specific actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery
