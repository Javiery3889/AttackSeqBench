### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory and then proceeds to encrypt payloads to evade detection.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows the use of PowerShell for in-memory execution and precedes the encryption of payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is a general tactic that includes techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading** - This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with running malware directly in memory.
   - **Tactic: Execution** - This tactic involves the process of running code or scripts.
   - **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This technique involves using PowerShell for execution, which is directly mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1546-Event Triggered Execution** - This technique involves triggering actions based on events, which does not directly follow the in-memory execution and does not necessarily precede encryption.
   - **B: T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure** - This technique involves modifying cloud infrastructure, which is not directly related to the in-memory execution or encryption of payloads.
   - **C: T1137-Office Application Startup** - This technique involves using office applications to start processes, which does not align with the in-memory execution or encryption of payloads.
   - **D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery** - This technique involves discovering and using peripheral devices, which is not related to the in-memory execution or encryption of payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of in-memory execution and evasion techniques, is the use of Reflective Code Loading (T1620) to further evade detection before encrypting payloads.
   - **Final Answer: T1620-Reflective Code Loading** (Note: T1620 is not explicitly listed in the answer choices, but it is the closest match to the described sequence of TTPs based on the provided information.)
