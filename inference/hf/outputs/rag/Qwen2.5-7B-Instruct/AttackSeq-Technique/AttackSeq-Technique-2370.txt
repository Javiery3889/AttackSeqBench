Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. PowerShell commands with multilayered base64 encoded code are used to install Poison Ivy.
2. After installation, the malware establishes communication with the C2 server at 'web.outlooksysm.net'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
- **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This is related to encoding techniques, which aligns with the base64 encoding mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Execution**: This is relevant to the execution of PowerShell commands.
- **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This is directly related to the use of PowerShell commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before the malware established communication with the C2 server. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1592.002-Software**: This TTP is not directly related to the techniques mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**: This TTP is not directly related to the techniques mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This TTP is about hiding artifacts, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This TTP is about using phishing to deliver malware, which could be a plausible method to deliver the encoded PowerShell commands.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the use of PowerShell commands with multilayered base64 encoded code to install Poison Ivy. This aligns with the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and standard encoding (T1132.001).
- The communication with the C2 server is established after the malware is installed. This suggests that the malware was delivered to the system first.
- Phishing (T1566) is a common method to deliver malware, and it could be used to trick the user into executing the encoded PowerShell commands.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that phishing (T1566) was used to deliver the malware, which then used PowerShell and encoding to install Poison Ivy.

### Final Answer: D
