### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious Office document is executed, and the payload is decrypted in memory.
   - The final step in the sequence is establishing communication to download the payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial step of executing macros from a malicious Office document.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the decryption or deobfuscation of files or information, which aligns with the in-memory payload decryption step.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it is relevant to the final step of communication, it does not directly address the decryption or deobfuscation of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves the use of web services for C2 communications. Similar to T1071, it is relevant to the final step but does not directly address the decryption or deobfuscation of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique directly addresses the decryption or deobfuscation of files or information, which is a step that occurs before the final communication to download the payload. However, it does not directly address the communication aspect.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
     - This technique involves determining the physical location of the target. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is the final step of establishing communication to download the payload. Among the given choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol and T1102-Web Service are the most relevant to the final step of communication. However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is the only technique that directly addresses the decryption or deobfuscation step, it is the most relevant to the overall sequence.

   **Final Answer: C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
