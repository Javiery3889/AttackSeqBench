### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware is disguised as documents with executable extensions and then executed using XtremeRat.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to make the malware appear legitimate and evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Defense Evasion," and the technique is "T1036-Masquerading."
   - T1036-Masquerading involves making malicious content appear legitimate to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1027.002-Software Packing** - This technique involves packing malware to make it smaller and harder to detect. However, it does not directly address making the malware appear legitimate.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** - This technique involves compromising or subverting trust controls, such as security certificates or digital signatures. While it can help evade detection, it does not directly address making the malware appear legitimate.
   - **C: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage** - This technique involves using thread local storage to hide malicious code or data. It is more about hiding the code rather than making it appear legitimate.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. It does not fit the context of making malware appear legitimate in documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The technique that best fits the context of making the malware appear legitimate and evade detection is T1036-Masquerading, which is directly related to the tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique of Masquerading.

**Final Answer: C**
