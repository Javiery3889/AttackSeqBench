Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Emissary Panda initially exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access and then used webshells to install on SharePoint servers. The next step is gathering credentials using Mimikatz for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** The initial access was achieved through exploiting CVE-2019-0604.
- **Credential Access (Tactic):** The next step involves gathering credentials using Mimikatz.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a TTP that logically occurs between the initial access and the credential gathering step.

- **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS for data exfiltration or command and control. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the credential gathering step.
- **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools** - This technique involves deploying software to gain access or maintain persistence. While it is related to the initial installation of webshells, it does not directly lead to credential gathering.
- **C: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information** - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host, which could be useful for further attacks but is not directly related to the credential gathering step.
- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which is directly related to the next step of gathering credentials using Mimikatz.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access was achieved through exploiting CVE-2019-0604 (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
- The next step is gathering credentials using Mimikatz (T1003.001-LSASS Memory).
- The technique that logically fits between these steps is gathering victim identity information (T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information), as it provides the necessary context and information for the credential gathering step.

### Final Answer: D
