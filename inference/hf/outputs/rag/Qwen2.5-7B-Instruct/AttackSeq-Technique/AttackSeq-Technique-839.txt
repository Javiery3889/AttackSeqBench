Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. WinDealer employs defense evasion by encrypting configuration files and stolen data.
2. The malware then retrieves details about the infected PC and network configuration.
3. The stolen data is staged under `%TEMP%`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1074-Data Staged**
  - This technique involves the attacker staging data in a way that makes it difficult for defenders to detect or understand the data. However, the question specifically mentions that the data is staged under `%TEMP%`, which is a local directory. T1074 is more about the method of staging data rather than the specific location.
  
- **B: T1542.001-System Firmware**
  - This technique involves modifying system firmware to maintain persistence or evade detection. It does not align with the described sequence of actions, as it does not involve retrieving network configuration or staging data under `%TEMP%`.

- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not align with the described sequence of actions, as it does not involve retrieving network configuration or staging data under `%TEMP%`.

- **D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves the attacker discovering network configuration details, which aligns with the step where the malware retrieves details about the infected PC and network configuration. After this, the data is staged under `%TEMP%`, which is a local directory.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware first employs defense evasion by encrypting configuration files and stolen data.
- Next, the malware retrieves details about the infected PC and network configuration, which aligns with T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
- Finally, the stolen data is staged under `%TEMP%`, which is a local directory and aligns with the technique of local data staging.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (to retrieve network configuration details)
- T1074-Data Staged (to stage the data under `%TEMP%`)

However, since the question asks for the most likely TTP that occurs after the malware retrieves details about the infected PC and network configuration, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
