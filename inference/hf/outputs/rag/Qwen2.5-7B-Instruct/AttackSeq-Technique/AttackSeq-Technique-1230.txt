Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. POWERSHOWER (a malware or tool) collects system information.
2. The collected information is transmitted to a C2 server.
3. The malware then enters a communications loop using a proxy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to communicate with the C2 server.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automated collection of data.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - This technique involves using multiple proxies, which is not directly mentioned in the question. The question specifies a single proxy, so this choice is less likely.

- **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with the C2 server. This aligns well with the sequence described in the question, as it involves using a proxy after the initial data collection and transmission.

- **Answer Choice C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input through a GUI, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where POWERSHOWER collects system information, transmits it to a C2 server, and then uses a proxy for communication.
- The related TTPs mention T1090.002-External Proxy and T1090-Proxy, both of which involve using a proxy for communication.
- Among the answer choices, T1090-Proxy (Answer Choice B) is the most relevant and aligns with the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: B
