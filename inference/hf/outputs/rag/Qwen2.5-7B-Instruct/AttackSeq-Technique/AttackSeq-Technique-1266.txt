Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Blind Eagle used a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
2. An unknown technique occurred after this.
3. The final technique used was the Login1.vbs script to ensure execution upon system startup.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique logically follows the use of a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands and precedes the use of Login1.vbs for ensuring execution upon system startup.

- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial execution method.
- **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts, which is not directly related to the sequence described (PowerShell -> unknown technique -> Login1.vbs).

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the sequence:
1. JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
2. An unknown technique.
3. Login1.vbs to ensure execution upon system startup.

The most plausible technique that fits between executing PowerShell commands and ensuring execution upon system startup is likely to be a technique that involves creating a persistent mechanism, such as a system timer or a startup script.

- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique directly involves ensuring execution upon system startup, which aligns with the final step in the sequence.

- **T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique involves creating timers using systemd, which is a more specific and less general technique compared to the broad category of ensuring execution upon system startup.

- **T1134.005-SID-History Injection**: This technique is not directly related to ensuring execution upon system startup and does not fit the sequence well.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (to ensure execution upon system startup).

Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
