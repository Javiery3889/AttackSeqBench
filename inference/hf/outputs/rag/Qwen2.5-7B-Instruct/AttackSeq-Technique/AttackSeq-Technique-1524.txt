### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where IRIDIUM initially gains access to government and defense-related organizations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Americas.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before their destructive campaigns were prepared.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique is related to the destructive campaigns.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1592.002-Software**
     - This technique is not directly related to the initial access or the preparation for destructive campaigns.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, which could be useful for reconnaissance but not directly for initial access or preparation for destructive campaigns.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**
     - This technique involves re-opening applications that were previously closed, which is not directly related to initial access or preparation for destructive campaigns.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is a common step in the initial access phase. It helps in tailoring the attack and preparing for further actions, including the eventual destructive campaigns.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs where gathering victim identity information (T1589) would occur before the preparation for destructive campaigns is:

**Final Answer: D**
