Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access is gained through a supply chain attack on NoxPlayer.
2. Malware execution flow is altered to hide the dialog and avoid displaying on the Windows Taskbar to simulate user interaction.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context and additional techniques that are relevant to the question:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves hiding a task or service to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party product or service to gain access to a target network.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.003-Hidden Window**: This technique involves hiding a window to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1547.010-Port Monitors**: This technique involves monitoring network ports, which is not directly related to hiding the dialog or avoiding the Taskbar.
- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique is related to the initial access through the supply chain attack on NoxPlayer, but it does not directly address the hiding of the dialog or Taskbar.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules, which is not directly related to hiding the dialog or Taskbar.
- **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs, which can be used to hide a window or task, aligning with the T1564.003-Hidden Window technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained through a supply chain attack (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise).
- After gaining access, the malware execution flow is altered to hide the dialog and avoid displaying on the Taskbar (T1564.003-Hidden Window).
- The use of native APIs (T1106-Native API) is a plausible method to achieve the hiding of the window or task.

### Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
