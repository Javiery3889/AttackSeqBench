Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question mentions that after executing the malicious file `System.doc`, a Defense Evasion technique was detected by FireEye's ExploitGuard, which identified anomalous behaviors in Microsoft Excel.
- We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before this Defense Evasion step.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution and the Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File.
- T1204.002-Malicious File refers to the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the question's mention of `System.doc`.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file or the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.
- **B: T1491-Defacement**
  - This technique involves modifying or destroying web content, which is not relevant to the execution of a malicious file or the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.
- **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
  - This technique involves modifying user accounts, which is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file or the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.
- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a later time. This could be a plausible step before the execution of a malicious file, as it could be used to ensure the file is executed at a later time, potentially evading immediate detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where a malicious file is executed, and then anomalous behavior is detected.
- The related TTPs mention the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the question.
- Among the answer choices, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job (D) is the most plausible technique that could occur before the execution of the malicious file, as it could be used to ensure the file is executed at a later time, potentially evading immediate detection.

### Final Answer: D
