### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Turla has established a hidden foothold for persistent access and is preparing to download specialized tools for gathering information and stealing documents.
   - We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the establishment of the foothold and precedes the download of specialized tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content**:
     - T1080 involves modifying shared content to spread malware or exfiltrate data. This technique is more about spreading malware rather than establishing a foothold or downloading tools.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**:
     - T1005 involves collecting data from the local system. This could be a step in gathering information before downloading specialized tools, but it doesn't directly follow the establishment of a foothold.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**:
     - This technique involves creating a task or service to run malicious code. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it doesn't directly follow the establishment of a foothold or precede the download of specialized tools.
   - **B: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**:
     - This technique involves staging data on a remote system. It could be used to prepare for downloading specialized tools, but it doesn't directly follow the establishment of a foothold.
   - **C: T1115-Clipboard Data**:
     - This technique involves monitoring clipboard data. It is more about data exfiltration rather than establishing a foothold or preparing to download tools.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**:
     - This technique involves using a rootkit to hide malicious activities. Establishing a hidden foothold and maintaining persistence often involves hiding activities, making this a strong candidate.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of establishing a hidden foothold and preparing to download specialized tools, is the use of a rootkit to maintain persistence and hide activities.
   - **Final Answer: D: T1014-Rootkit**
