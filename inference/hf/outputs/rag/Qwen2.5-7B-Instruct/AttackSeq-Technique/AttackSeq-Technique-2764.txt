Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A Listener was configured within Cobalt Strike.
2. Communication with the C2 server was enabled.
3. Reflective DLL injection was used to load the beacon.dll.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique logically follows the configuration of the Listener and enables communication with the C2 server, and precedes the reflective DLL injection.

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly enable communication with a C2 server or precede reflective DLL injection.
  
- **B: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
  - This technique involves using container orchestration to run jobs. It is not directly related to enabling communication with a C2 server or reflective DLL injection.
  
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a connection. This is a plausible technique that could enable communication with a C2 server after the Listener is configured.
  
- **D: T1056.001-Keylogging**
  - This technique involves keylogging, which is a method of collecting keystrokes. It does not directly enable communication with a C2 server or precede reflective DLL injection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Listener is configured within Cobalt Strike.
- Communication with the C2 server is enabled, which aligns with the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique.
- Reflective DLL injection is used to load the beacon.dll, which is a technique that follows the establishment of communication with the C2 server.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T1071-Application Layer Protocol enables communication with the C2 server, which is a necessary step before reflective DLL injection.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
