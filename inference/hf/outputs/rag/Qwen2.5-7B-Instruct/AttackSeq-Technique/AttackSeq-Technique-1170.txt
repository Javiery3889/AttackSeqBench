### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a custom cryptographic protocol is used for communication with C&C servers.
   - The goal is to maintain operational security and avoid detection during external communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for command and control (C&C) communications.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the nature of the communication.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C&C communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**
     - This technique involves storing data in memory without writing to the file system. It does not directly relate to the communication process described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data at a later time. It does not directly relate to the communication process described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This is a duplicate of Answer Choice B and can be disregarded.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain operational security and avoid detection. It aligns well with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
