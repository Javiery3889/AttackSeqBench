### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where data (keylogged data, clipboard content, and personal files) is collected using `sysOptimizer.bat` and other components.
   - The data is then transferred to an FTP server operated by SecondEye.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the description of collecting keylogged data, clipboard content, and personal files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique is about transferring tools into a network, which does not align with the transfer of collected data to an external server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook** - This technique involves using webhooks for data exfiltration, which is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the FTP server transfer.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal** - This technique involves traversing network address translation (NAT) to access internal networks, which is not relevant to the transfer of data to an external FTP server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** - This technique involves using alternative protocols for data exfiltration, which aligns with the transfer of data to an FTP server, an alternative protocol to HTTP/HTTPS.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
