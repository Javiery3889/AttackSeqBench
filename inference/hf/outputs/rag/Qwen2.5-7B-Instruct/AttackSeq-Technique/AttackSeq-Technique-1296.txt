Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises were used to gain access.
2. This resulted in the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code on the target system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
  - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to execute commands on a remote system. It is not directly related to the initial access via spear-phishing or strategic Web compromises.

- **Answer Choice B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
  - This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the initial access via spear-phishing or strategic Web compromises.

- **Answer Choice C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
  - This technique involves executing code or commands in response to a specific event. While it could be part of the post-exploitation phase, it does not directly address the initial access via spear-phishing or strategic Web compromises.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malicious content. The question mentions spear-phishing emails, which is a specific type of phishing. This aligns with the initial access phase described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises to gain access.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1566-Phishing is relevant to the initial access phase.
- The execution of customized Poison Ivy server code is a post-exploitation activity, but the question is specifically asking about the initial access technique.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible initial access technique is T1566-Phishing.

**Final Answer: D**
