Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers and uses methods like `DownloadString` and `DownloadData` to request and download payloads. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before this sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or data to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. It does not directly relate to the communication with C2 servers or the downloading of payloads.
- **Answer Choice B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to the system. While it can be a precursor to many attacks, it does not directly relate to the PowerShell script or the C2 communication.
- **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or data to the target system. This is a plausible precursor to the PowerShell script communicating with C2 servers and downloading payloads.
- **Answer Choice D: T1027.003-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. It does not directly relate to the communication with C2 servers or the downloading of payloads.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where a PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers and downloads payloads.
- The related TTPs include `T1059.001-PowerShell` for execution and `T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer` for transferring tools or data.
- `T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer` is the most relevant TTP as it directly involves transferring tools or data to the target system, which is a logical precursor to the PowerShell script communicating with C2 servers and downloading payloads.

### Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
