Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attacker gains persistence through the Milestone backdoor by creating a service named `msupdate2` and copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
2. The next step is establishing command and control (C2) through uncompressed communication with the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Persistence**: T1543.003-Windows Service (already mentioned in the question)
- **Command and Control**: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**
  - This technique is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described. It involves discovering and using containers and resources, which is not relevant to the persistence and C2 establishment described.

- **B: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
  - This technique involves using messaging applications for C2. While it could be a method for C2, the question specifies "uncompressed communication," which is not a characteristic of messaging applications.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using web services for C2. However, the question specifies "uncompressed communication," which is not a characteristic of web services.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system. While it could be a step before establishing C2, it does not directly relate to the specific method of C2 communication (uncompressed communication).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where persistence is established through a Windows service, and then C2 is established through uncompressed communication.
- The related TTPs mention T1104-Multi-Stage Channels for C2, which aligns with the uncompressed communication method.
- None of the other techniques (A, B, or C) directly align with the specific method of C2 communication described in the question.

### Final Answer: D
