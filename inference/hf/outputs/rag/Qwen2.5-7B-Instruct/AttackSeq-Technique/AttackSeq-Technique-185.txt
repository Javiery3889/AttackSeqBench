### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Infamous Chisel first collects predefined files of interest and then exfiltrates them using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - The specific TTP we need to identify is the one that enables the enumeration of data directories and gathering of system information before the exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging** - This technique is related to the collection of data but does not specifically mention the enumeration of data directories or gathering of system information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique is explicitly about discovering files and directories on the system, which aligns with the need to enumerate data directories and gather system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.001-Web Cookies** - This technique is related to web cookies and does not align with the need to enumerate data directories and gather system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique is about using non-application layer protocols, which is not directly related to the enumeration of data directories and gathering of system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087.004-Cloud Account** - This technique is about using cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the enumeration of data directories and gathering of system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique directly aligns with the need to discover files and directories on the system, which is necessary for enumerating data directories and gathering system information.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
