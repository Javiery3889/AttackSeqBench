### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor establishes communication with a C&C server using XML messages and collects system and geolocation information.
   - The specific TTP of interest is the one that enables secure and encrypted communication for data transmission before the backdoor communicates with the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain command and control communications, which aligns with the need for secure and encrypted communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is relevant but not the initial step in enabling secure communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is compromised, which is not directly related to enabling secure communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1001.001-Junk Data** - This technique involves sending junk data to obfuscate the true nature of the communication. It does not directly enable secure and encrypted communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique directly addresses the need for secure and encrypted communication, which is a prerequisite for the backdoor to establish communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection, which is not directly related to enabling secure communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption** - This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is a method of encryption but does not specifically address the need for a secure and encrypted channel for command and control communication.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that enables secure and encrypted communication for data transmission before the backdoor establishes communication with the C&C server is:

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
