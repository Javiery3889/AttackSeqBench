Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Sayad malware first gathers information from the compromised host, then encrypts the data using an RSA public key, and finally uploads it to the C2 server. We need to identify which TTP occurred immediately after the malware gathered the information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data, which could be a step after gathering information but before encryption and exfiltration.
- **C: T1612-Build Image on Host**: This technique involves building an image on the host, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **D: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves phishing to gather information, which is a different phase and not directly related to the sequence of actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware first gathers information (system details, running processes, open ports).
- The next step is likely to archive or prepare the collected data for encryption and exfiltration.
- Among the given choices, **T1560-Archive Collected Data** (B) is the most plausible technique that would occur immediately after gathering information.

### Final Answer: B
