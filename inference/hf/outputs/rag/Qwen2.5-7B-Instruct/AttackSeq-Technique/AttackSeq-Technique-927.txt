Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where:
1. Volatile Cedar uses keylogging capabilities to gain credential access.
2. The campaign then connects to a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection Tactic**: This is relevant to the initial keylogging activity.
- **Command and Control Tactic**: This is relevant to the connection to the multi-tiered server backend framework.
- **Credential Access Tactic**: This is directly related to the keylogging activity.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. While it could be part of the overall campaign, it does not directly align with the keylogging and multi-tiered server backend connection described in the question.

- **B: T1497.001-System Checks**
  - This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in a desired state. While it could be part of the campaign, it does not directly align with the keylogging and multi-tiered server backend connection described in the question.

- **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
  - This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection. While it could be used in the campaign, it does not directly align with the keylogging and multi-tiered server backend connection described in the question.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the target. This aligns well with the connection to a multi-tiered server backend framework, which is a form of command and control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where keylogging is used to gain credentials, and then the campaign connects to a multi-tiered server backend framework.
- The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic, which is directly related to the connection to the multi-tiered server backend framework.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D) is the most relevant to the described connection to a multi-tiered server backend framework.

### Final Answer: D
