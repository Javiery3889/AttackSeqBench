### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where SideCopy utilized malicious LNK files for infection, followed by the deployment of various RATs and plugins (file enumerators and credential-stealers).
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows the use of malicious LNK files and precedes the deployment of RATs and plugins.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves infecting shared content, which aligns with the use of malicious LNK files.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves executing malicious files, which could be the next step after infecting LNK files.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which could be a step in preparing to deploy RATs and plugins.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a supply chain to deliver malicious code. While it is a significant TTP, it does not directly follow the use of malicious LNK files and precede the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making malicious content appear legitimate. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the use of malicious LNK files and precede the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves signaling to other actors to initiate an attack. It is more about coordination and does not directly follow the use of malicious LNK files and precede the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using deceptive communications to trick users into providing sensitive information. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the use of malicious LNK files and precede the deployment of RATs and plugins.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is the execution of the malicious files (T1204.002-Malicious File) after the use of malicious LNK files and before the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - **Final Answer: D: T1204.002-Malicious File**
