Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. ATMitch reads commands from a file in the 'c:\intel' folder.
2. Interacts with ATM drivers to dispense money using the 'msxfs.dll' library.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the described actions.

- **A: T1657-Financial Theft** - This technique is more about the theft of financial data or assets, not directly about interacting with ATM drivers.
- **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools** - This technique is about deploying software, but it doesn't directly relate to the interaction with ATM drivers.
- **C: T1489-Service Stop** - This technique involves stopping services, which doesn't align with the described actions.
- **D: T1053.003-Cron** - This technique involves using cron jobs, which is not directly related to the interaction with ATM drivers.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence
The related TTPs mention **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**, which is relevant to the interaction with the 'msxfs.dll' library. This technique involves injecting a dynamic-link library into a process, which aligns with the described action of interacting with ATM drivers.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the injection of a DLL, which is a key part of the described action.

### Final Answer: 
Final Answer: B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools

While T1072 is not the most direct match, it is the closest in context to the described actions among the given choices. The other options do not align as closely with the described sequence of actions.
