Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Persistence is established by creating a `.LNK` file in the Windows startup directory.
2. Grandoreiro hooks APIs and registers a binary as the default handler for `.MSC` files to elevate privileges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before Grandoreiro's actions to hook APIs and register a binary as the default handler for `.MSC` files.

- **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code. This could be a method to establish persistence.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding entries to the Windows registry or startup folder to ensure the malware runs at system startup. This is a common method for persistence.

Given that the question mentions creating a `.LNK` file in the startup directory, T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is directly relevant.

### Step 4: Determine the Sequence
The sequence of TTPs should be:
1. Establishing persistence by adding a `.LNK` file to the startup directory (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).
2. Using Grandoreiro to hook APIs and register a binary as the default handler for `.MSC` files (which is a method to escalate privileges).

### Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices
- **A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**: This technique involves creating a process that mimics another process. It is not directly related to establishing persistence or privilege escalation.
- **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves exploiting mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. It is more about the final step of privilege escalation rather than the initial persistence.
- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves discovering software on the system. It is not directly related to the persistence or privilege escalation steps.
- **D: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**: This technique involves using the `netsh` command to register a helper DLL. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it is not the most direct method for establishing persistence.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which aligns with the `.LNK` file in the startup directory. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
