Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that FIN13 utilized external servers to deploy web shells for initial access. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred earlier as part of their efforts to understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique is about deploying web shells, which aligns with the question's mention of web shells for initial access.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's organization, which fits the question's requirement of understanding the victim's organizational structure.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services, which is consistent with the use of external servers for deploying web shells.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1006-Direct Volume Access**: This technique involves accessing a volume on a target system, which is not directly related to understanding the organizational structure or planning for infiltration.
- **Option B: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is more about reconnaissance but not specifically about gathering information about the victim's organization.
- **Option C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique directly involves gathering information about the victim's organization, which aligns well with the question's requirement.
- **Option D: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic, which is more about monitoring network activity rather than understanding the organizational structure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for a technique that occurred earlier to understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration.
- The related TTPs mention T1591-Gather Victim Org Information, which is directly related to gathering information about the victim's organization.
- The other options do not align as closely with the specific requirement of understanding the organizational structure.

### Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information
