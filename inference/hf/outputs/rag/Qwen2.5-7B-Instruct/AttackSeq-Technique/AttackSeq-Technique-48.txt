### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with Initial Access through phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of a PowerShell script that delivers Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Attachment," which aligns with the initial step of the attack sequence described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
     - This TTP is not relevant to the initial attack vector described (phishing emails).
   - **B: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This TTP is related to the initial access through phishing, but it does not specifically mention the use of malicious Word documents.
   - **C: T1552.003-Bash History**
     - This TTP is not relevant to the initial attack vector or the execution of a PowerShell script.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This TTP is relevant to the execution of a PowerShell script, which is the next step in the sequence after the initial access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence should start with the initial access through phishing emails and then proceed to the execution of a PowerShell script.
   - The TTP that best fits the step between initial access and the execution of the PowerShell script is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
