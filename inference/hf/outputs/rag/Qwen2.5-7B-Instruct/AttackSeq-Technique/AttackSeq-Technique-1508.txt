### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after spear phishing activities targeting the ASEAN region, suggesting a focus on reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using a web service to deliver spear phishing emails.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves gathering email addresses for reconnaissance purposes.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using attachments in spear phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While it is a reconnaissance technique, it is not directly related to the spear phishing activities mentioned in the question.
   - **Option B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service, which is mentioned in the related TTPs as part of spear phishing activities (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service). However, it is more about the delivery mechanism rather than the next step after reconnaissance.
   - **Option C: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information. Given that the question mentions spear phishing activities and a focus on reconnaissance, this technique is a logical next step as it directly relates to gathering information from the targets.
   - **Option D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves using obfuscated files or information to evade detection. While it can be part of an attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of spear phishing activities and a focus on reconnaissance, is to gather information from the targets. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
