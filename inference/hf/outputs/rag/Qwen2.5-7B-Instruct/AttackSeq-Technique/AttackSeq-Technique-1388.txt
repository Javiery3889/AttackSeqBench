Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Raccoon stealer collects data.
2. The stealer bypasses blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel.
3. The stealer receives encrypted C&C server addresses.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using malicious content to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the network requests to a Telegram channel or receiving C&C server addresses.
- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly explain the network requests to a Telegram channel.
- **C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification** - This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions to maintain persistence or avoid detection. It does not directly explain the network requests to a Telegram channel.
- **D: T1010-Application Window Discovery** - This technique involves discovering and interacting with application windows to gather information. It does not directly explain the network requests to a Telegram channel.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The question describes the stealer making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses. This aligns most closely with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique, which is part of the Exfiltration tactic. The T1020-Automated Exfiltration technique also fits within the Exfiltration tactic and could be a precursor to the C&C server address retrieval.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the stealer first exfiltrates data (T1020) and then uses the exfiltrated data to establish a C2 channel (T1041).

**Final Answer: T1020-Automated Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**

However, since the question asks for a single answer choice, the most direct and relevant TTP from the given choices is:

**Final Answer: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
