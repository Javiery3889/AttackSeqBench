Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Duke group:
1. They collected detailed bot/system information.
2. They used Seaduke to update bot configurations.
3. They uploaded files for operational control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering information from the local system, which aligns with the first step of collecting detailed bot/system information.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to the target system, which aligns with the second step of using Seaduke to update bot configurations.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which is not directly mentioned in the question but could be a subsequent step.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**: This technique involves using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to boot a system. It does not directly align with the sequence of actions described in the question.
- **B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**: This technique involves retrieving data from a configuration repository. While it could be relevant, it does not directly follow the sequence of collecting information and updating configurations.
- **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using a multi-hop proxy to route traffic. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **D: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be a subsequent step, it does not directly follow the sequence of collecting information and updating configurations.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first step in the sequence is collecting detailed bot/system information, which aligns with T1005-Data from Local System.
- The second step is using Seaduke to update bot configurations, which aligns with T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
- The third step is uploading files for operational control, which is not directly mentioned but could be a subsequent step.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after updating bot configurations and uploading files for operational control would be to ensure the data is transmitted securely, which could involve data encoding.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
