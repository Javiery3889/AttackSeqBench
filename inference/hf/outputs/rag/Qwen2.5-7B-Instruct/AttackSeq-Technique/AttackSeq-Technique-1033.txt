Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Kingslayer backdoor was loaded via the malicious 'Alpha' software subversion.
2. It then evaded detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**
  - This technique involves using remote access software to gain access to a system. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for evasion.

- **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
  - This technique involves using domain controller authentication to gain access. It is more about gaining initial access rather than evading detection.

- **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
  - This technique involves using polymorphic code to evade signature-based detection. While it is related to evasion, it does not specifically mention time-based evasion.

- **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain elevated privileges or access. It is more about gaining privileges rather than evading detection.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The question specifically mentions a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for evasion. The related TTPs also mention T1497.003-Time Based Evasion, which aligns with the use of a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

- **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion** is directly related to the use of a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm, which is a form of time-based evasion to avoid detection.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes T1497.003-Time Based Evasion.

### Final Answer: C (T1027.014-Polymorphic Code) is not the best fit, but the closest related TTP is T1497.003-Time Based Evasion, which is not listed as an answer choice. The best answer choice provided is C, as it is the closest to the concept of polymorphic code, which can be used for evasion.

Final Answer: C
