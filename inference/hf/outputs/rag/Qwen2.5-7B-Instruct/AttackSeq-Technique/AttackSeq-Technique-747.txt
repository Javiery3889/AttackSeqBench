Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred to maintain persistent access to the victim's system after executing a reconnaissance tool and a RAT (Remote Access Tool) retrieved from an external source.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**: This technique involves compromising a software binary on the host to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.004-Compile After Delivery**: This technique involves compiling code after delivery to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying a system process to maintain persistence. However, it does not directly relate to the context of compromising a software binary or using external remote services.
- **Answer Choice B: T1546.016-Installer Packages**
  - This technique involves using installer packages to maintain persistence. While it can be a method, it does not directly align with the context of the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying a system service to maintain persistence. This aligns well with the context of compromising a software binary or using external remote services.
- **Answer Choice D: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted non-C2 (Command and Control) protocol. It does not align with the context of maintaining persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on maintaining persistent access to the victim's system.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for persistence, such as compromising a software binary (T1554) and using external remote services (T1133).
- Among the answer choices, T1569 (System Services) is the most relevant because it directly involves creating or modifying a system service, which is a common method to maintain persistence.

### Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services
