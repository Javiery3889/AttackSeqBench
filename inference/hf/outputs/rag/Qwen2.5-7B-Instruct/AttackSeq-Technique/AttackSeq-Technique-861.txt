Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Key hosts are used as beachheads.
2. Conpee or Etso tools are deployed.
3. Scheduled system tasks are added using compromised credentials from pwdump6.

The final part of the question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided information:

- **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique involves using mail protocols for command and control. However, the question specifies non-HTTPS traffic on port 443, which is not typically associated with mail protocols.

- **B: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning networks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. It does not directly relate to C2 communication on a specific port.

- **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control. The question specifies port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which aligns with this technique.

- **D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure to support the adversary's operations. It does not directly relate to the specific C2 communication on port 443.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading to C2 communication.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1571-Non-Standard Port, which aligns with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
- Among the answer choices, T1571-Non-Standard Port is the only one that directly relates to the specific port and type of traffic mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port
