Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. An Office Excel document with malicious macros is used for initial access.
2. After this initial access, a PowerShell script is used to decode and execute the malicious content.
3. The decoded content is written to the %TEMP% directory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying files or registry entries to ensure that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. This does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script after initial access.

- **Answer Choice B: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
  - This technique involves using DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) to execute code. While it is a method of executing code, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

- **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. T1059.001 specifically mentions PowerShell, which aligns with the use of a PowerShell script to decode and execute the malicious content. This fits the sequence as it directly involves the use of PowerShell after initial access.

- **Answer Choice D: T1055.009-Proc Memory**
  - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process. While it is a method of execution, it does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script after initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where initial access is gained through a malicious Office Excel document, followed by the use of a PowerShell script to decode and execute the malicious content.
- The related TTPs mention the use of PowerShell, which aligns with the use of a scripting interpreter.
- Among the answer choices, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (specifically T1059.001-PowerShell) is the most relevant and fits the sequence of events described in the question.

### Final Answer: C
