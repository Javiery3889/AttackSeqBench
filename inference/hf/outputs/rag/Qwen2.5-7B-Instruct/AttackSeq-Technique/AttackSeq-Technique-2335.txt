Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Cinobi uses form-grabbing and web traffic modification to steal banking credentials.
2. It then communicates with its C&C server over the Tor proxy for downloading additional malware stages and configuration files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context and additional techniques that are relevant to the question:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with a C&C server.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**: This technique involves stealing session information, which aligns with form-grabbing and web traffic modification.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the communication with the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**: This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
- **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique is directly related to the described sequence, as it involves using a proxy to communicate with the C&C server.
- **C: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique is related to changing DNS records to evade detection, which is not directly relevant to the described sequence.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not directly relevant to the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of a proxy to communicate with the C&C server, which aligns with the T1090-Proxy technique.
- The related TTPs also mention T1090-Proxy, further confirming its relevance.
- The other techniques (T1542.002-Component Firmware, T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS, and T1566-Phishing) do not align with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy
