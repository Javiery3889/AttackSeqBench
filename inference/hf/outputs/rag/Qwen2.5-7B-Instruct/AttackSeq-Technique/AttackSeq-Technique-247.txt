### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where `CertUtil.exe` is disguised as `GoogleUpdate.exe` to evade detection.
   - The next step in the sequence is to maintain persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves using legitimate names or locations to evade detection.
     - **Technique: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves hiding or disguising malicious tasks or services to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports to communicate with the attacker. It does not directly relate to maintaining persistence through repeated executions of a payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1505.003-Web Shell**
     - This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistence. However, it is more related to web-based persistence rather than scheduled or task-based persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to run the payload repeatedly. This aligns well with the need to maintain persistence through repeated executions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1583.007-Serverless**
     - This technique involves using serverless computing to maintain persistence. It is less common and more complex compared to scheduled tasks.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to maintain persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.

**Final Answer: C**
