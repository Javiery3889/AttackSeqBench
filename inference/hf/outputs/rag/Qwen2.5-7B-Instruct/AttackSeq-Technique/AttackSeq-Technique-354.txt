### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the threat actors have already evaded defenses using techniques like Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls.
   - The next step in the sequence is to gather internal system information to further their objectives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1484.002-Trust Modification:** This technique involves modifying trust relationships to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves mimicking legitimate users or systems to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves taking over a remote service session, which is more about gaining control over a service rather than gathering internal system information.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying processes running on a system, which is useful for gathering information but not necessarily for furthering objectives.
   - **C: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves accessing the Active Directory database, which is a powerful method for gathering internal system information, especially in a Windows environment.
   - **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves discovering remote systems, which is more about identifying targets rather than gathering internal system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve a technique that directly gathers internal system information to further the threat actors' objectives.
   - **T1003.003-NTDS** is the most relevant technique as it directly accesses the Active Directory database, which contains critical internal system information.

### Final Answer: C
