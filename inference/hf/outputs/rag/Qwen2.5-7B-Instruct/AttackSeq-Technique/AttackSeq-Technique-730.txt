### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the main component is set up during the execution phase, and then the C&C servers are used to hide the 'mothership' control server's location.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique facilitated this hiding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can be used to obfuscate the location of the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS to resolve domain names, which can be used to hide the location of the C&C server by using domain names that do not directly point to the 'mothership' control server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using multiple fallback channels to maintain communication, which can be used to hide the primary C&C server by using alternative channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interpreters to execute commands, which is not directly related to hiding the location of the C&C server.
   - **B: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries, which is not directly related to hiding the location of the C&C server.
   - **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names, which can be used to hide the location of the C&C server by using domain names that do not directly point to the 'mothership' control server.
   - **D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to communicate, which is not directly related to hiding the location of the C&C server.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated the 'Red October' campaign's C&C servers in hiding the 'mothership' control server's location is **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**.

Final Answer: C
