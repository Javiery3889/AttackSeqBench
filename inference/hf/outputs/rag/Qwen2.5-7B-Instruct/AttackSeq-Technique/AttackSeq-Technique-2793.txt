### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where sensitive information is collected from an iOS device and then sent out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.
   - The key elements are:
     - Collection of sensitive data (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data).
     - Encoding of the data using Base64.
     - Use of a random prefix in the encoded data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Command and Control" tactics and specifically reference "Data Encoding" (T1132).
   - T1132-Data Encoding is directly relevant to the encoding of data, which aligns with the Base64 encoding mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1614-System Location Discovery**
     - This technique is related to discovering and exfiltrating location data, but it does not specifically mention encoding or Base64.
   - **Option B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique directly relates to encoding data, which matches the Base64 encoding mentioned in the question.
   - **Option C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**
     - This technique is used for hiding the true destination of network traffic, which is not directly related to the encoding of data.
   - **Option D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software to gain access, which is not related to the encoding of data.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the use of T1132-Data Encoding to encode the collected data using Base64 and a random prefix.

**Final Answer: B**
