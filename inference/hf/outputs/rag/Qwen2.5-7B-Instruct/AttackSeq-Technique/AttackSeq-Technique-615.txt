Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions that occur before gaining initial access to internal hosts. Specifically, it mentions:
- Enumerating services
- Authenticating via brute force
- Scanning ports

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force**: This technique involves using automated tools to try multiple passwords or other authentication methods to gain access.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves actively scanning a network to discover hosts and services. While it fits the scanning part, it does not directly involve brute force or service enumeration.
- **B: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique involves gathering information about the domain, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **C: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to mask the attacker's IP address. It does not fit the context of the question.
- **D: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It does not fit the context of the question.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- **T1110-Brute Force** for authenticating via brute force.
- **T1078.003-Local Accounts** for creating or modifying local user accounts.

However, the question specifically asks for the technique that involves enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports. The most fitting technique from the provided choices is:

**Final Answer: A: T1595-Active Scanning**

This is because T1595-Active Scanning best fits the description of actively scanning services and ports, which is a precursor to the brute force and local account creation techniques mentioned in the question.
