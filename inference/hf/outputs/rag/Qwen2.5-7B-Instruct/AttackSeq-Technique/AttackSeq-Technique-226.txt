### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Process Hollowing is used to inject shellcode into legitimate Windows applications.
   - After this, the attacker collects data from Chromium and Firefox browsers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting data from Chromium and Firefox browsers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the question and is used to inject shellcode into legitimate applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique is not directly related to the collection of data from web browsers and does not fit the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System**
     - This technique is related to Linux systems and does not fit the context of Windows browsers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique is about hiding artifacts from defenders, which could be a step after collecting data but is not directly related to the collection itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into web pages, which could be a method to collect data from browsers, but it is not specifically about stealing credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is the technique that directly involves stealing credentials from web browsers.
   - **Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts** (Although this is not the exact technique for stealing credentials, it is the closest fit among the given choices for the context of hiding artifacts after data collection.)

However, if we strictly adhere to the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most accurate answer would be:

**Final Answer: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers (not listed in the choices)**

Given the choices provided, the closest fit is:

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
