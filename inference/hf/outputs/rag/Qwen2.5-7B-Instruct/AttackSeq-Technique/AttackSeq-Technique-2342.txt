Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro is delivered.
2. The VBA macro is executed.
3. 'mshta.exe' is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick the user into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious content. While it could be part of the initial delivery of the PowerPoint add-in, it does not directly relate to the execution of the VBA macro or the use of 'mshta.exe'.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it is related to the execution of the VBA macro, it does not directly address the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper.
- **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries to load a malicious DLL. It does not directly relate to the execution of the VBA macro or the use of 'mshta.exe'.
- **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code. This directly relates to the execution of the VBA macro in the PowerPoint add-in.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the execution of a VBA macro in a PowerPoint add-in, which aligns with T1059.005-Visual Basic.
- The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper is a separate step that follows the execution of the VBA macro.
- The related TTPs do not provide additional context that would suggest a different sequence of TTPs.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1059.005-Visual Basic (execution of the VBA macro)
- T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute the dropper)

However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs specifically mention T1059.005-Visual Basic, the best answer choice is:

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
