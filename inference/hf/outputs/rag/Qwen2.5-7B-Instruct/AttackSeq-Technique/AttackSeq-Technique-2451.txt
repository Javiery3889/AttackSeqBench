### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where DRAGONFISH performed system information collection, retrieved installed software, and proxy details as part of its reconnaissance.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592.002-Software** - This technique involves gathering information about software installed on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, including system configuration and network details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery** - This technique involves identifying and listing software installed on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1106-Native API (A)**: This technique involves using native system APIs to perform actions, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but does not directly follow the described actions.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery (B)**: This technique involves identifying and listing processes running on the target system. This could be a logical next step after gathering system and software information.
   - **T1069.002-Domain Groups (C)**: This technique involves querying domain controllers for group membership information. This is more related to network reconnaissance and does not directly follow the described actions.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port (D)**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. This is more related to establishing a foothold or maintaining access and does not directly follow the described actions.

### Final Answer:
Based on the described sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after system information collection, retrieved installed software, and proxy details would be to discover the processes running on the target system.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
