Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through exploiting CVE 2014-0515 via a watering hole attack. The next step in the sequence is to maintain communication with the compromised systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a malicious website or drive-by download.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using remote access software to establish a persistent connection. While it is a plausible technique for maintaining access, it is not directly related to the initial access via a watering hole attack.
- **Answer Choice B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default or weak credentials to gain access. It is not directly related to the initial access via a watering hole attack.
- **Answer Choice C: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This is the same as Answer Choice A, so it is not directly related to the initial access via a watering hole attack.
- **Answer Choice D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a malicious website or drive-by download. Given that the initial access was gained through a watering hole attack (which is a form of drive-by compromise), it is logical that the attacker would use the same method to maintain communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access was gained through exploiting CVE 2014-0515 via a watering hole attack.
2. A watering hole attack is a form of drive-by compromise, where the attacker compromises a website to deliver malware.
3. To maintain communication, the attacker is likely to use the same method, which is a drive-by compromise.
4. The related TTPs confirm that T1189-Drive-by Compromise is relevant to the initial access and can be used to maintain access.

**Final Answer: D**
