Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already collected data using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. The next step in the sequence is to communicate with remote servers to exfiltrate the data and receive updates for the malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel to exfiltrate data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves transferring data to a removable medium, which does not align with the question's requirement to communicate with remote servers.
- **Answer Choice B: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique is about using multiple authentication factors, which is not related to exfiltrating data or communicating with remote servers.
- **Answer Choice C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using domain fronting to hide the true destination of network traffic, which can be used to exfiltrate data over a C2 channel. However, it is more about hiding the traffic rather than the primary method of exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a remote server, which is a common method for exfiltrating data and receiving updates for malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the next step is to communicate with remote servers to exfiltrate data and receive updates for the malware.
- The related TTPs mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which directly aligns with the requirement to use a C2 channel for exfiltration.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D) is the most relevant because it involves using application layer protocols to communicate with remote servers, which is a common method for both exfiltrating data and receiving updates for malware.

### Final Answer: D
