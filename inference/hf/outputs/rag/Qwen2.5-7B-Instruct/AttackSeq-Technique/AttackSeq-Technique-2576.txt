Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. An attacker uses a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions to execute code.
2. After executing the code, the attacker obfuscates a JavaScript payload to hinder analysis.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence:

- **A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves compromising a trusted system or control to gain an advantage. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly follow the execution of a VBA-Macro in a Word document.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using deceptive communication to lure victims into providing sensitive information. It doesn't align with the sequence of executing a VBA-Macro and then obfuscating a JavaScript payload.

- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. T1059.005-Visual Basic specifically refers to using a Visual Basic interpreter, which aligns with the use of VBA-Macro functions in the Word document. However, this technique is more about the initial execution and doesn't directly relate to the obfuscation of the JavaScript payload.

- **D: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves using the "at" command to schedule tasks. It doesn't align with the sequence of executing a VBA-Macro and then obfuscating a JavaScript payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence starts with a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions, which aligns with T1059.005-Visual Basic.
- After executing the VBA-Macro, the attacker obfuscates a JavaScript payload to hinder analysis. This obfuscation step is a separate technique that doesn't directly follow from the execution of the VBA-Macro but is a subsequent action.

Given the options and the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- The initial execution of the VBA-Macro (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
- The subsequent obfuscation of the JavaScript payload (which is not directly listed but can be inferred as a separate action).

However, since the question asks for the most likely technique that occurred after the execution of the VBA-Macro, and none of the provided options directly match the obfuscation step, the closest match is the execution technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** (specifically T1059.005-Visual Basic, which is the closest match to the execution of the VBA-Macro).
