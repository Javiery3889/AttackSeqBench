Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where OceanLotus executed PowerShell scripts to load additional payloads and scripts from their command-and-control (C2) server. The focus is on the continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution** - This is relevant as it pertains to the execution of code or scripts.
- **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This is directly mentioned in the question and is a key part of the attack sequence.
- **Tactic: Command and Control** - This is relevant as it pertains to the C2 server and the transfer of payloads.
- **Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This is relevant as it pertains to transferring tools or payloads from the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. While PowerShell is a scripting interpreter, this technique is more general and does not specifically address the continuous operation of the in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **B: T1137.003-Outlook Forms** - This technique involves using Microsoft Outlook forms to deliver malicious content. This is not directly related to the PowerShell scripts or the continuous operation of the in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves configuring files to run at system boot or user logon. This could be relevant for ensuring the payload is always available, but it does not directly address the continuous operation of the in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **D: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type** - This technique involves modifying file properties to make a malicious file appear as a legitimate file. This is not directly related to the continuous operation of the in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions the use of PowerShell scripts to load additional payloads and scripts from the C2 server. This aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique.
- The continuous operation of the in-memory payload delivery infrastructure suggests a mechanism that ensures the payload remains active and operational. This is best addressed by a technique that allows for the execution of scripts or commands in a persistent manner.
- Among the given options, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (A) is the most relevant as it directly pertains to the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is the core of the attack sequence described.

### Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
