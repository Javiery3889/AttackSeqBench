Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. Sayad malware communicates with its C2 server.
2. The malware uploads collected data.
3. The data is encrypted and uploaded to a malicious web server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Command and Control (C2)**: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- **Exfiltration**: T1020-Automated Exfiltration, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
- This technique involves using web services to exfiltrate data.
- It aligns with the scenario where data is uploaded to a malicious web server.

**B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
- This technique involves gathering information about the system.
- It does not align with the scenario of uploading data to a web server.

**C: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**
- This technique involves dealing with limitations on data transfer size.
- It does not directly align with the scenario of uploading data to a web server.

**D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- This technique involves using a C2 channel for exfiltration.
- While it involves exfiltration, it is more specific to using a C2 channel, which is already mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware uploading data to a malicious web server.
- The related TTPs mention exfiltration techniques, including T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
- T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is the most direct match for uploading data to a web server.

### Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
