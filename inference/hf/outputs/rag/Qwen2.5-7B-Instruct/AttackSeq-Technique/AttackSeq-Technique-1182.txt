Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A backdoor collects machine information and screenshots.
2. The collected data is sent to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
3. The next step involves querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection Tactic**: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing (This is not directly relevant to the exfiltration step but might be used for initial access or maintaining persistence.)
- **Exfiltration Tactic**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (This is directly related to the step of sending data to the C&C server and might involve querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be used to gain access, it does not directly align with the step of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

- **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
  - This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. It does not fit the context of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using a web service to communicate with a remote server. This aligns well with the step of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages, as it involves communication over a network.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It does not fit the context of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is collected and sent to a C&C server, and then the next step involves querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, suggest that the next step involves communication over a network.
- Among the given choices, T1102-Web Service (C) is the most plausible technique for querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

### Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
