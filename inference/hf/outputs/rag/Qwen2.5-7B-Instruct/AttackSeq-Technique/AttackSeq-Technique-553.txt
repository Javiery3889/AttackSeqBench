Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs during Operation Pawn Storm:
1. Multistage downloaders established execution.
2. Legitimate-looking phishing websites redirected targets for credential harvesting.
3. Logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages to capture credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context and additional techniques used in the attack:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing credentials by logging victim input on web portals.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing links to trick victims.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the described credential harvesting process.
- **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the logging of victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
- **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for data encryption. It does not align with the described credential harvesting process.
- **D: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This technique involves attempting to log in with a large number of username and password combinations. It does not align with the described logging of victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages, which is a form of input capture.
- The related TTPs mention T1056.003-Web Portal Capture, which aligns with the described technique of logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
- The other techniques do not match the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
