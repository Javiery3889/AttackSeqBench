Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT42:
1. Conducting internal reconnaissance by accessing shared collaborative spaces and collecting system information.
2. Moving through the network using compromised email accounts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat messages to obtain credentials. However, the question does not mention chat messages, so this is less relevant.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves the development and use of email accounts for malicious purposes. This is directly related to the compromised email accounts mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into providing credentials or clicking on malicious links. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly align with the described actions of accessing shared collaborative spaces and collecting system information.
- **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections to understand the network topology. This could be part of the reconnaissance phase but does not directly align with the use of compromised email accounts.
- **C: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a session to a remote service. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly align with the described actions of accessing shared collaborative spaces and collecting system information.
- **D: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the Component Object Model (COM) to execute arbitrary code. This is a more advanced technique and does not directly align with the described actions of accessing shared collaborative spaces and collecting system information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes APT42 moving through the network using compromised email accounts, which aligns with the T1586.002-Email Accounts technique.
- The reconnaissance actions (accessing shared collaborative spaces and collecting system information) are more aligned with T1049-System Network Connections Discovery, but the question specifically mentions compromised email accounts.
- The other techniques (spearphishing, session hijacking, and COM hijacking) do not directly align with the described actions.

### Final Answer: D
