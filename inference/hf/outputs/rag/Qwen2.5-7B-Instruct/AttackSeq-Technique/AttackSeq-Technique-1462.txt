Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tildeb (a 32-bit console Windows executable) establishes communication with a C&C server using a secure communication channel and encrypted traffic. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique best fits this scenario.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with a C&C server, which aligns with the question's requirement for secure communication and encrypted traffic.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using a Windows command shell, which is relevant to the initial execution of Tildeb as a 32-bit console Windows executable.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography, which is a method of encryption that is often used in secure communication channels.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to establishing a secure communication channel or encrypted traffic.
- **Answer Choice B: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic, which is not directly related to the secure communication or encrypted traffic described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols, which could be relevant but does not specifically address the secure communication and encrypted traffic mentioned.
- **Answer Choice D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding infrastructure, which is not directly related to the secure communication and encrypted traffic described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the establishment of a secure communication channel and encrypted traffic to a C&C server.
- The related TTPs mention T1573-Encrypted Channel and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography, which directly align with the secure communication and encrypted traffic.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C) is the closest match, as it involves using application layer protocols, which can include encrypted communication.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
