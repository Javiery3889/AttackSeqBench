### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations, then uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique supports their efforts in targeting user accounts within victim networks before the lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique is related to the use of web shells for persistence, which aligns with the later part of the sequence (after gathering information and before lateral movement).
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique is about discovering system owners or users, which is relevant to the initial gathering of information on network and host configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique is about discovering domain trusts, which is more about network-level information rather than user accounts.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique is about using pluggable authentication modules, which is not directly related to the initial gathering of user account information.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives, which is not directly related to the initial gathering of user account information.
   - **D: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique is about discovering user accounts, which aligns well with the initial gathering of information on network and host configurations to target user accounts.

### Final Answer:
The technique that most likely supports FIN13's efforts in targeting user accounts within victim networks before employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement is **T1087-Account Discovery**.

Final Answer: D
