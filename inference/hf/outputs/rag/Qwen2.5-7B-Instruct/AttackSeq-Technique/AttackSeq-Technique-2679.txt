### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before ZoxPNG established initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests by sending a PNG file containing instructions or data.
   - This implies that the technique in question should be a preparatory step that enables or facilitates the HTTP GET request and the use of a PNG file for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. It aligns with the HTTP GET request mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves discovering available internet connections, which could be a preparatory step for establishing a C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other data, which aligns with the use of a PNG file to send instructions or data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This is a broader technique that includes web protocols, but it does not specifically mention HTTP GET requests or the use of a PNG file.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:** This technique involves rapidly changing DNS records to evade detection, which is not directly related to the HTTP GET request or the use of a PNG file.
   - **C: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access, which is not directly related to the HTTP GET request or the use of a PNG file.
   - **D: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native system APIs, which is not directly related to the HTTP GET request or the use of a PNG file.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the context of establishing initial contact with a C2 server through HTTP GET requests and the use of a PNG file, is T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery. This technique would be a preparatory step to ensure that the necessary internet connection is available before the HTTP GET request is made.
   - Additionally, T1001.002-Steganography would be used to hide the data within the PNG file, but it is not the most likely technique to occur before the initial contact.

**Final Answer: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
