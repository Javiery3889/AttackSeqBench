Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Emissary Panda used Active Scanning to identify systems with specific vulnerabilities.
2. The next step was gaining initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
  - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is not directly related to the active scanning of systems with specific vulnerabilities. It does not fit the sequence as it precedes the active scanning.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a remote host. While it is related to network communication, it does not directly describe the active scanning or the exploitation of vulnerabilities.

- **C: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning networks or systems to identify open ports, services, or vulnerabilities. This aligns with the question's description of Emissary Panda leveraging Active Scanning to identify systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144.

- **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. It is not directly related to the active scanning or the exploitation of vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Emissary Panda first uses Active Scanning to identify systems with vulnerabilities.
- The next step is gaining initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers.
- Among the given choices, T1595-Active Scanning (C) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the active scanning described in the question.

### Final Answer: C: T1595-Active Scanning
