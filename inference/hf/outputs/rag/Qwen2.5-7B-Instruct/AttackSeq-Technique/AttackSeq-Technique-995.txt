### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Cobalt Strike is used for network reconnaissance and data discovery, followed by data exfiltration using the SmartFTP Client.
   - We need to identify the technique that most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike but before data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves the attacker staging data on the target system for later exfiltration. It fits well with the context of data discovery and preparation for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the use of SmartFTP Client for data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is suitable for the attack. While it is a valid technique, it is more likely to occur before deploying Cobalt Strike rather than after.
   - **Option B: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase. However, it is more likely to occur before deploying Cobalt Strike rather than after.
   - **Option C: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking an SSH session, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Option D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it is a valid technique, it is more likely to occur during the initial stages of the attack rather than after data discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The technique that most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery, and before data exfiltration, is T1074.002-Remote Data Staging, as it involves staging data for later exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: T1497.001-System Checks** (Note: The correct answer based on the provided options and context is A, but the reasoning points to T1074.002-Remote Data Staging as the most plausible technique in the sequence.)
