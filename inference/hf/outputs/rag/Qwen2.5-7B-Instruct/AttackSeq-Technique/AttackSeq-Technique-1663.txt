Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Defense evasion techniques such as DLL search order hijacking and disabling tools are used.
2. An unknown technique occurs before using HTTPS protocol for C2 communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control (C2) communication.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **A: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves enumerating logs to find information that can be used to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections to identify potential C2 channels. It is more about identifying connections rather than a step before using HTTPS for C2.
- **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves impairing or disabling security controls. It aligns with the defense evasion techniques mentioned (DLL search order hijacking and disabling tools).
- **D: T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot**: This technique involves booting the system in safe mode to disable security software. It is a specific sub-technique of T1562 and does not fit the sequence as well as T1562.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that defense evasion techniques such as DLL search order hijacking and disabling tools are used. This aligns with T1562-Impair Defenses.
- After impairing defenses, the next step would be to use HTTPS for C2 communication, which is a web protocol (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1562-Impair Defenses (impaired defenses)
2. T1071.001-Web Protocols (used HTTPS for C2 communication)

Therefore, the answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
