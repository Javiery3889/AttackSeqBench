Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spear-phishing attack using exploits for known vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. Infection of remote hosts during lateral movement in the local area network.
3. Establishment of a sophisticated C&C infrastructure with proxy servers and over 60 domain names.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely employed to infect remote hosts during the lateral movement phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided related TTPs:

- **A: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**
  - This technique is not directly related to the lateral movement or exploitation of remote services. It is more about acquiring technical data, which does not fit the context of the question.

- **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using vulnerabilities to gain access to remote services. Given that the initial access was gained through a spear-phishing attack using exploits for known vulnerabilities, it is plausible that the same technique (T1210) would be used to infect remote hosts during lateral movement.

- **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
  - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to gain access to resources. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities mentioned in the question.

- **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access. While it can be used for lateral movement, it does not align with the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the initial access is gained through a spear-phishing attack using exploits for known vulnerabilities.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services as a technique for lateral movement.
- T1210 aligns best with the context of the question, as it involves using vulnerabilities to gain access to remote services, which is consistent with the initial access gained through exploits.

### Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
