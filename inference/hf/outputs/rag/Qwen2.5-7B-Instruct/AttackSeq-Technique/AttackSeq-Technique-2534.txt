Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. LURK malware maintains persistence by creating a link in the Startup folder and leveraging associated files in the `%AppData%\Help` directory.
2. The malware then communicates with its command-and-control (C2) server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Persistence**: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
- **Command and Control**: T1568-Dynamic Resolution

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the communication aspect of the question, specifically the use of dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.

- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the communication aspect.
- **B: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. It also does not directly relate to the communication aspect.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically mention dynamic DNS or specific ports.
- **D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**: This technique involves overwhelming the target system with traffic to exhaust resources. It does not relate to the communication aspect.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the communication aspect of the malware, specifically how it communicates with its C2 server.
- The related TTPs mention dynamic DNS resolution (T1568), which is directly related to the use of dynamic DNS domains.
- None of the answer choices directly mention dynamic DNS or specific ports, but T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the closest in terms of being related to communication.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the application layer protocol used for communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
