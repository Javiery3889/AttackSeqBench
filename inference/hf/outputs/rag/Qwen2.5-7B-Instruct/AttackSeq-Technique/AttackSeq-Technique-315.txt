### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where W32.Flamer initially gains access through a man-in-the-middle attack on Windows Update.
   - The next step in the sequence is the collection of data from the compromised systems, which is encrypted with a public key.
   - We need to determine which technique occurred immediately after gaining initial access but before data collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the "Initial Access" tactic, which aligns with the context of gaining initial access to the network.
   - The techniques mentioned are:
     - T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
     - T1078.003-Local Accounts
     - T1189-Drive-by Compromise

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. While it is a method of spreading malware, it does not directly align with the sequence of gaining access and then collecting data.
   - **T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts to gain persistence or additional access. This could be a step after gaining initial access but before data collection.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a system through a web page or other online resource. While it is a method of gaining initial access, it does not directly align with the sequence of gaining access and then collecting data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that after gaining initial access, the malware would likely create or modify local user accounts to gain persistence or additional access before collecting data.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **T1078.003-Local Accounts**.

**Final Answer: D: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
