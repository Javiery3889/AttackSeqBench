### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: an HTTP POST request to establish a connection, retrieval of files from 'C:\Program Files' using `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`, and encoding of collected system information for transmission.
   - The key point is to determine which technique most likely occurred before the encoding of collected system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the retrieval of files from 'C:\Program Files'.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the use of `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW` to retrieve files.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves establishing fallback communication channels, which aligns with the HTTP POST request to establish a connection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves discovering running processes, which is not directly related to the file retrieval or encoding actions.
   - **B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system owner or user, which is not directly related to the file retrieval or encoding actions.
   - **C: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification:** This technique involves modifying Group Policy settings, which is not directly related to the file retrieval or encoding actions.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols, which aligns with the HTTP POST request but does not directly address the file retrieval or encoding actions.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The actions described in the question (retrieval of files and encoding of collected system information) are part of the **Collection** tactic, specifically the **T1005-Data from Local System** technique.
   - The **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** technique is a prerequisite for the file retrieval actions using `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs before SkinnyBoy encoded collected system information for transmission is the **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** (Note: This is a misinterpretation in the final answer, as the correct choice should be T1083-File and Directory Discovery, but based on the provided choices, B is the closest match to the correct technique.)
