Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware gathers information on processes and memory utilization, and then performs specific actions such as capturing screenshots, controlling the mouse, and retrieving credentials. The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique facilitated these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the tactic "Collection" and the technique "T1113-Screen Capture." This indicates that the malware is involved in collecting information, and specifically, capturing screenshots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**: This technique involves filtering password hashes or other sensitive information from memory. While it is related to credential information, it does not directly address the actions of capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
- **B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code in a way that it appears to be initiated by the user. It does not directly relate to the actions of capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
- **C: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves archiving data using a library. It does not directly relate to the actions of capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
- **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the actions of controlling the mouse's point-and-click functions. However, it does not directly address the action of capturing screenshots.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions capturing screenshots, which is directly related to the technique "T1113-Screen Capture."
- The technique "T1113-Screen Capture" is the most relevant to the described actions of capturing screenshots.
- While "T1056-Input Capture" is related to controlling the mouse, it does not directly address the action of capturing screenshots.

### Final Answer: T1113-Screen Capture

However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs do not directly include "T1113-Screen Capture," we need to choose the closest match from the given options. The closest match to the described actions is "T1056-Input Capture," as it is related to controlling the mouse.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
