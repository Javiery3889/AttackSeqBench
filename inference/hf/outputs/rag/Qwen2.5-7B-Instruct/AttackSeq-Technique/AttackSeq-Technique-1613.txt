Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group has already established communication with the C&C server using backdoor malware samples #4 and #6. The final step in this sequence is to disrupt the bank's operations during the FEIB heist. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique would most likely be used as the final step to achieve this disruption.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques used:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run at a later time.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.002-At** - This technique is similar to T1053.005 and involves creating scheduled tasks.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels** - This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain control over the compromised system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution** - This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which might be used to execute a payload but does not directly align with the final step of disrupting operations.
- **B: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm** - This technique involves using the `regsvcs` or `regasm` commands to register or unregister COM+ components. While it can be used to execute code, it does not directly disrupt operations.
- **C: T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion** - This technique involves deleting files or directories based on certain conditions. This could be used to remove evidence or disrupt operations, making it a strong candidate.
- **D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact** - This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable. While it can disrupt operations, it is more about data manipulation rather than direct disruption.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the final step is to disrupt the bank's operations. Among the given choices, T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion (C) is the most plausible because it directly aligns with the goal of disrupting operations by deleting critical files or directories.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1053.005-Scheduled Task and T1053.002-At, suggest that the malware might use scheduled tasks to execute this deletion at a critical time, aligning with the tactic of execution and persistence.

### Final Answer: C
