### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes CosmicDuke collecting sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates the transfer of this information to remote servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves the use of keyloggers to capture keystrokes, which is part of the collection of sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
     - This technique involves transferring data to a removable medium (e.g., USB drive). This does not align with the question, as the information is being transferred to remote servers, not removable media.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network. While this is part of the collection process, it does not directly address the transfer of collected data to remote servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique directly addresses the transfer of data to remote servers, which aligns with the question's description of transferring collected information to remote servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which is a specific method of automated exfiltration. While it is related to the transfer of data, T1020 is a more general technique that encompasses various methods of automated exfiltration, including web services.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**.

Final Answer: C
