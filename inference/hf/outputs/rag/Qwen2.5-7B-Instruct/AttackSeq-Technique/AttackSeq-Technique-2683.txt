### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where KiraV2 first conducts telnet dictionary attacks to compromise IoT devices using weak credentials.
   - After compromising the devices, KiraV2 employs anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain a long-term infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** The question mentions that the first step is a telnet dictionary attack, which aligns with the T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** The question states that KiraV2 uses anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain a long-term infection. This aligns with techniques such as T1078-Valid Accounts and T1497.003-Time Based Evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique is not directly related to the initial compromise or the use of valid accounts to evade detection.
   - **B: T1653-Power Settings:** This technique is not relevant to the initial compromise or the use of valid accounts to evade detection.
   - **C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:** This technique involves gaining access to a network or system to establish a foothold, which could be a step before using valid accounts to maintain persistence. However, it does not directly align with the use of anti-analysis techniques.
   - **D: T1110-Brute Force:** This technique involves using automated tools to guess passwords or other authentication factors. This aligns with the initial telnet dictionary attack to compromise IoT devices. After compromising the devices, the use of valid accounts (T1078) to maintain persistence and evade detection (T1497.003) would follow.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
