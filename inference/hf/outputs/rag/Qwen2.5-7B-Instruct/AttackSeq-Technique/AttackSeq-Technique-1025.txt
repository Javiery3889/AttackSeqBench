Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Gamaredon discovered interesting files, such as Office documents, on a system.
2. This discovery is for future exfiltration.
3. The malware then scans all drives and removable media for sensitive files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which is relevant to the scanning of drives and removable media.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the initial discovery of interesting files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from local systems, which is not directly related to the initial discovery of files or the scanning of drives and removable media.
- **B: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: These are scripting languages that can be used for automation. While they can be used in the context of the attack, they do not directly align with the sequence of discovering files and then scanning drives.
- **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which is more related to the exfiltration phase rather than the initial discovery and scanning.
- **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which can be used in the context of scanning drives and removable media for sensitive files. However, it is more general and does not specifically align with the initial discovery of files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial discovery of interesting files (Office documents) aligns with **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.
- The subsequent action of scanning all drives and removable media for sensitive files aligns with **T1025-Data from Removable Media**.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that occurs after the initial discovery but before the scanning of drives and removable media is the discovery of files and directories.

**Final Answer: C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method** is not the best fit. The best fit is **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** (not listed in the choices), but the closest and most plausible choice from the given options is **D: T1106-Native API**, as it can be used in the context of scanning drives and removable media.

Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
