Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Proprietary data is compressed using WinRAR.
2. APT10 extracts data from Dropbox using cURL for Windows.
3. The data is accessed from the cloud.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves accessing data from a repository, which could be relevant to the extraction of data from Dropbox. However, it does not directly address the compression step.
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services, which could be relevant to accessing cloud storage. However, it does not directly address the compression step.
- **T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**: This technique directly involves accessing data from cloud storage, which aligns with the extraction of data from Dropbox. However, it does not directly address the compression step.
- **T1614.001-System Language Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the system language, which is not directly related to the compression or extraction steps.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the sequence of events:
1. Proprietary data is compressed using WinRAR.
2. The compressed data is then accessed from Dropbox.
3. The data is extracted from Dropbox using cURL for Windows.

The technique that most likely occurred after the data was compressed using WinRAR is the technique that involves accessing the data from Dropbox. Among the given choices, **T1530-Data from Cloud Storage** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the extraction of data from Dropbox, which is the final step in the sequence.

Final Answer: C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage
