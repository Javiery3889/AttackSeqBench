### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where LightNeuron first discovers system network configurations using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
   - It then uses a backdoor function to exfiltrate locally collected data.
   - We need to identify the TTP that occurs between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," and the technique is "T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery."
   - This confirms that the initial action of discovering network configurations is part of the "Discovery" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves using a network provider DLL to modify network behavior. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data but rather to modifying network settings.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves accessing data from the local system. It could be a plausible step between discovering network configurations and exfiltrating data, as it involves accessing data on the local system.
   - **C: T1123-Audio Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing audio data. It is not relevant to the context of network configuration discovery and data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It is the final step in the sequence described in the question, not the step that occurs after discovering network configurations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible TTP that occurs after discovering network configurations and before exfiltrating data is T1005-Data from Local System, as it involves accessing data from the local system, which is a necessary step before exfiltrating it.

**Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System**
