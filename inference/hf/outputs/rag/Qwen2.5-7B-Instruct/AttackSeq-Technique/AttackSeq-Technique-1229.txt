### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers used anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process to prevent clues from being left on disk or in the registry.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" as a tactic and specifically "T1070-Indicator Removal" and "T1070.004-File Deletion" as techniques.
   - T1070.004-File Deletion is a sub-technique of T1070-Indicator Removal, which involves removing indicators of compromise (IoCs) to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**:
     - This technique is about exploiting file permissions to execute malicious code. It does not directly follow the anti-forensics step described in the question.
   - **B: T1137-Office Application Startup**:
     - This technique involves using legitimate office applications to execute malicious code. It does not directly follow the anti-forensics step described in the question.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**:
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the need to prevent clues from being left on disk or in the registry.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**:
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain privileges or execute code. It does not directly follow the anti-forensics step described in the question.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the removal of indicators of compromise (IoCs) to avoid detection. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal
