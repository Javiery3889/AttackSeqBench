Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious 32-bit CCleaner binary is modified to call malicious code and execute stages of the malware payload. It then mentions that a technique was used to deallocate memory associated with the DLL and exit the execution thread before the malware established persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process's memory to gain control or escalate privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard**: This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
- **Option B: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution**: This technique involves resolving APIs at runtime, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
- **Option C: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process's memory, which aligns with the described sequence of actions. The question mentions dealing with a DLL and memory deallocation, which could be part of a process injection technique.
- **Option D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a supply chain to deliver malware, which is not directly related to the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where a malicious binary is modified to call malicious code, and then a technique is used to deallocate memory associated with the DLL and exit the execution thread.
- The related TTPs mention T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection, which involves injecting code into a process's memory.
- T1055-Process Injection is a broader technique that encompasses the actions described in the question, including dealing with a DLL and memory deallocation.

### Final Answer: C: T1055-Process Injection
