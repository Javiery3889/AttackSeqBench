Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Establishing command and control using FTP and HTTP.
2. Encrypting data with AES for transmission.
3. Machete exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file is present.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated data exfiltration, which aligns with the scenario where data is exfiltrated when a specific file is present.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the use of FTP and HTTP for C2.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, which aligns with copying data to removable drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltration over a non-C2 channel using asymmetric encryption. While it involves encryption, it does not align with the specific scenario of copying data to removable drives when a specific file is present.
- **Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the described data exfiltration scenario.
- **Answer Choice C: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is not directly related to the described data exfiltration scenario.
- **Answer Choice D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, which aligns with the scenario of copying data to removable drives.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where data is exfiltrated by copying it to removable drives when a specific file is present.
- The related TTPs mention T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB, which is a specific sub-technique of T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium.
- T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium is the most direct match for the described scenario of copying data to removable drives.

### Final Answer: D
