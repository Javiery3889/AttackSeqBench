Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an APT group first deploys a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL, and then establishes a simple remote command shell connecting to its C2 server. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred after the DLL side-loading.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique is about establishing a channel for command and control, which aligns with the establishment of a remote command shell.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL through a legitimate-looking component, which matches the described deployment of a renamed Microsoft component.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is the same technique as above, emphasizing the evasion aspect of loading the DLL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1218.008-Odbcconf**: This technique involves using the ODBC configuration to establish a covert channel, which is not directly related to the deployment of a DLL or the establishment of a remote command shell.
- **Answer Choice B: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**: This technique involves using DNS queries to exfiltrate data or establish a covert channel, which is not directly related to the deployment of a DLL or the establishment of a remote command shell.
- **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server, which is relevant to the establishment of a remote command shell but not directly to the deployment of the DLL.
- **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow to load a malicious DLL, which aligns with the described deployment of a renamed Microsoft component to load the malicious DLL.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The deployment of a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL is a form of DLL side-loading, which is covered by T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading.
- After the DLL side-loading, the next step would be to establish a remote command shell, which is a form of command and control.
- The technique that best fits the sequence after the DLL side-loading and before establishing the remote command shell is T1574-Hijack Execution Flow, as it directly relates to the deployment of the malicious DLL.

**Final Answer: D**
