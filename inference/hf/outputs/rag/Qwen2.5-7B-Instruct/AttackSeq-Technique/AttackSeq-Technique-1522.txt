Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malicious code is obfuscated using the Dean Edwards Packer and base62 encoding.
2. The obfuscated code is then appended to a compromised CDN's JavaScript file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1659-Content Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious content into a web page or application. While it fits the context of appending code to a JavaScript file, it does not directly address the obfuscation step mentioned in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page that the user visits. It does not directly address the obfuscation or the appending of code to a JavaScript file.

- **Answer Choice C: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. It is not relevant to the context of appending obfuscated code to a JavaScript file.

- **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. The question explicitly mentions that the malicious code is obfuscated using the Dean Edwards Packer and base64 encoding. This technique directly addresses the obfuscation step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malicious code is first obfuscated and then appended to a JavaScript file.
- The related TTPs mention the obfuscation technique (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information).
- Among the answer choices, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (D) is the only one that directly addresses the obfuscation step.

### Final Answer: D
