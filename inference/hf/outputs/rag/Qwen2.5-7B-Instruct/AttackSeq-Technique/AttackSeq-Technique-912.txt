### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the FAKEM RAT disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols such as Windows Messenger or Yahoo! Messenger.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique facilitated this to hinder detection through encryption manipulation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**
     - This technique involves making the malware or its communications appear to be from a legitimate source.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**
     - This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to disguise malicious activity.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves disguising the malware or its communications to appear as legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1600-Weaken Encryption**
     - This technique involves weakening encryption to facilitate the exfiltration of data. It does not directly address the disguise of network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1053.003-Cron**
     - This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. It is not related to disguising network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to command and control, it does not specifically address the disguise of network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1562.007-Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud firewalls to facilitate access. It does not address the disguise of network traffic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described scenario is **T1036-Masquerading** (which is a broader category that includes T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location and T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation).
   - This technique directly addresses the disguise of network traffic to look like legitimate protocols, which is the core of the question.

### Final Answer: C (T1071-Application Layer Protocol) is the closest match, but the most specific and relevant technique is T1036-Masquerading. However, since the exact match is not provided, the best choice from the given options is C.
