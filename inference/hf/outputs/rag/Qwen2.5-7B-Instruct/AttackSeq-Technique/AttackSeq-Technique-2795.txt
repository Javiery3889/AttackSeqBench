Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an XAgent app, after hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7, is collecting geo-location data from the device. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely used for this purpose.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**
  - This technique involves the attacker making the malware appear as legitimate software to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves the attacker collecting data from the local system, which could include various types of data such as files, network information, and system information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be used in the context of data exfiltration, it does not directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
- **Answer Choice B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**
  - This technique involves using pluggable authentication modules to bypass authentication mechanisms. It is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
- **Answer Choice C: T1614-System Location Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering the location of the system, which directly aligns with the question of collecting geo-location data.
- **Answer Choice D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering the system owner or user, which is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about collecting geo-location data.
- Among the given choices, T1614-System Location Discovery is the most relevant technique as it directly pertains to discovering the location of the system, which is geo-location data.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location, suggest that the malware is trying to evade detection, which is a common tactic in the collection phase. However, the core technique for collecting geo-location data is T1614.

### Final Answer: C
