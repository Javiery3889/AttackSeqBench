Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ProjectM actors executed malicious payloads.
2. They exploited vulnerabilities and used malicious macros.
3. They developed a significant toolset.
4. They created domains registered with WHOIS protection services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Resource Development
- Technique: T1583.001-Domains

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
  - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains. It does not directly relate to the development of a toolset or creating domains with WHOIS protection services.

- **Answer Choice B: T1592.003-Firmware**
  - This technique involves modifying firmware. While it is a resource development technique, it does not directly relate to the creation of domains or the use of malicious macros.

- **Answer Choice C: T1578.001-Create Snapshot**
  - This technique involves creating a snapshot of a system or environment. It does not directly relate to the creation of domains or the use of malicious macros.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using deceptive communication to lure victims into providing sensitive information. While it can be part of the initial attack vector, it does not directly relate to the creation of domains or the use of malicious macros.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly leads to the creation of domains with WHOIS protection services. The related TTPs specifically mention "T1583.001-Domains," which is a technique under the Resource Development tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not explicitly listed in the answer choices, but the closest related TTP is T1583.001-Domains. However, since we need to choose from the given options, none of the provided choices directly align with the creation of domains with WHOIS protection services.

**Final Answer: None of the provided answer choices directly align with the attack sequence described in the question. However, if we must choose, the closest related TTP is T1583.001-Domains, which is not listed in the answer choices.**
