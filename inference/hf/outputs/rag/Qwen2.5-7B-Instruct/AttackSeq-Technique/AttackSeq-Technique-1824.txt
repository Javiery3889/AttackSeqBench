### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Service Worker script intercepts HTTPS POST requests to steal username and password pairs.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this interception.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing** - This technique involves sniffing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing** - This technique is similar to the above but specifically related to credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, but it does not directly relate to the interception and stealing of credentials.
   - **B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers** - This technique involves the use of systemd timers, which is not relevant to the interception and stealing of credentials.
   - **C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie** - This technique involves stealing web session cookies, which can be used to maintain access to a web application. However, the question specifically mentions stealing username and password pairs, not just session cookies.
   - **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets** - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets, which is not directly related to the interception of HTTPS POST requests for username and password pairs.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Given that the Service Worker script intercepts HTTPS POST requests to steal username and password pairs, the next logical step would be to use these credentials to gain access to the webmail service.
   - **T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie** is the most relevant technique here because it directly involves using the stolen credentials to maintain access to the web application.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie
