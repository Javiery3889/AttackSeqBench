### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first disguise North Korean fundraising apps as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps to evade suspicion. Before this disguise, the attackers need to distribute the malicious app to gain access to victims.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1647-Plist File Modification:** This technique involves modifying system configuration files to evade detection. While it is related to defense evasion, it does not directly describe the initial distribution of the malicious app.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious activity to make it appear benign. This is relevant to the final step of the sequence but not the initial distribution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. This could be a plausible method for initial distribution, as it can be used to exploit users through a seemingly legitimate application.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using deceptive communication to lure victims into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. While phishing is a common method for initial distribution, the question specifies that the app is disguised as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps, which suggests a more sophisticated method.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding malicious artifacts to evade detection. This is more relevant to the final step of the sequence, where the app is disguised, rather than the initial distribution.
   - **D: T1037.004-RC Scripts:** This technique involves using resource configuration (RC) scripts to execute commands. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not a common method for initial distribution of malware.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the initial distribution of the malicious app, before the final disguise, is **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

**Final Answer: A**
