Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. A first stage downloader saves a file at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe".
2. This file later retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
3. The attack involves a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the attack techniques used:
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users who visit the site.
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising the true nature of an attack to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves sending a malicious payload through a service or application. However, the question does not mention any spearphishing activity, so this is less likely.
- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control server. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly address the initial access or the drive-by compromise aspect.
- **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code without a traditional server. It is not directly related to the initial access or the drive-by compromise.
- **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique directly addresses the scenario where a compromised website delivers malicious content to users. This aligns well with the question's description of a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence involves a compromised website delivering malicious content, which aligns with T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
- The use of a first stage downloader and a second stage PlugX file indicates a multi-stage attack, which is consistent with T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.
- The spoofing of the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities" website is a form of masquerading, which is consistent with T1036-Masquerading.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is driven by the initial access technique of T1189-Drive-by Compromise.

### Final Answer: D
