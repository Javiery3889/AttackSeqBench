Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. FoggyWeb configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic legitimate AD FS URIs.
2. It retrieves sensitive AD FS data.
3. It exfiltrates this data back to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves passively monitoring network traffic to discover information about the network and its components.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique is not directly related to the described sequence. It involves signaling to a C2 server to initiate a data exfiltration or other action.
- **Answer Choice B: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, which is not relevant to the described sequence.
- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically address the exfiltration of data.
- **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the described sequence of retrieving and exfiltrating sensitive AD FS data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where sensitive data is retrieved and then exfiltrated. The related TTPs indicate that the technique for exfiltration is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
- T1041 is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, which is the final step in the described sequence.

### Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
