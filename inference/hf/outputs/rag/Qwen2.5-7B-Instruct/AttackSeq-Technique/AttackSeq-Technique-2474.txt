Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where stolen credentials are exfiltrated to an FTP server using legitimate tools to evade detection. The key aspect here is that the attack remains undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the exfiltration of stolen credentials.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique involves using code signing to evade detection, which could be relevant if the legitimate tools used for exfiltration were signed.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols, which is also relevant to the exfiltration of stolen credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is a prerequisite for the exfiltration but does not directly address the evasion aspect.
- **Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making an attacker's activity appear legitimate, which could help in evading detection but is not directly related to the use of legitimate tools and scripts.
- **Answer Choice C: T1053.002-At**: This choice seems incomplete and does not provide a clear technique.
- **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which is a prerequisite for the exfiltration but does not directly address the evasion aspect.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question emphasizes the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection, which aligns with the concept of using code signing to make the activity appear legitimate.
- T1553.002-Code Signing (from the related TTPs) is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.

### Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading

However, upon re-evaluation, the most plausible answer is actually T1553.002-Code Signing, as it directly addresses the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection. Therefore, the correct final answer is:

Final Answer: T1553.002-Code Signing
