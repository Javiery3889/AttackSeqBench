### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an organized criminal group that gained initial access through targeted emailing and infections from other botnets.
   - The group then used tools like Mimikatz and Anunak malware to carry out attacks on banks and payment systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after gaining initial access but before using Mimikatz and Anunak malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
     - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - T1656-Impersonation

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (A):**
     - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malicious content to the target. It does not directly fit the sequence as it is more about the delivery mechanism rather than the post-access activity.
   - **T1566-Phishing (B):**
     - This technique includes both spearphishing links and attachments, which aligns with the initial access through targeted emails. However, it is more about the initial access method rather than the post-access activity.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping (C):**
     - This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which is a common post-access activity. Tools like Mimikatz are used for credential dumping, making this a strong candidate.
   - **T1498.001-Direct Network Flood (D):**
     - This technique involves flooding a network with traffic to disrupt services. It does not align with the described sequence of activities.

### Final Answer:
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the use of tools like Mimikatz and Anunak malware for credential dumping after gaining initial access.
- **Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
