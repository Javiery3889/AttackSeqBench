Let's break down the question and the related TTPs to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Intercepting transaction data using malicious scripts.
2. Sending the data to a collection server.
3. Funneling stolen assets through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
- **Financial Theft (T1657)**: This technique involves stealing financial assets.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before the described sequence:
- **A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. It doesn't directly relate to the described sequence.
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. It could be a precursor to the described sequence but doesn't directly involve the interception and exfiltration of transaction data.
- **C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring funds at a scheduled time. It doesn't fit the context of intercepting and exfiltrating data.
- **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one used for normal communication. While it involves exfiltration, it doesn't fit the context of the described sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Intercepting Transaction Data**: This action suggests a form of data theft or data exfiltration.
2. **Sending to Collection Server**: This indicates a method of data exfiltration.
3. **Funneling Stolen Assets**: This suggests a method of transferring or moving the stolen assets.

Given the context, the most plausible TTP that fits before the described sequence is one that involves the initial theft or exfiltration of data. **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** (D) is the closest fit, as it involves exfiltrating data, but it doesn't directly fit the sequence of actions described.

However, the question asks for the TTP that most likely occurred before the described sequence, and the related TTPs do not provide a direct match for the initial theft or exfiltration of data. The closest match in the provided options is **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** (D), as it involves exfiltration, which is a key part of the described sequence.

### Final Answer: D
