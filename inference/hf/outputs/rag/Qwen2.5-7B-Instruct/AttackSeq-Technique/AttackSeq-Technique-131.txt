### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT-TOCS executed Shellcode scripts in memory for network communication via Beacon mode.
   - The initial access technique is being asked for, which is the first step in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
   - **Privilege Escalation:** T1055-Process Injection
   - **Execution:** T1059.001-PowerShell

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the system. This is a common method for attackers to establish a foothold in a network.
   - **T1055-Process Injection:** This technique is used for privilege escalation, not for initial access.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique is used for execution, not for initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible initial access technique that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

### Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
