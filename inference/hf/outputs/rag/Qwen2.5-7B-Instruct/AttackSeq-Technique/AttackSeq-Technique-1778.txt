Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after Sayad malware enumerated system information and gathered data from browsing applications, the next step was to systematically gather keystrokes, clipboard contents, and other sensitive user interactions. This indicates that the malware is focusing on collecting sensitive data from the user's interactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1565.002-Transmitted Data Manipulation**: This technique is about manipulating data that is transmitted over a network, which is not directly related to the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves logging keystrokes, which aligns with the question's requirement to gather keystrokes.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves collecting clipboard contents, which also aligns with the question's requirement to gather clipboard contents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automated collection of data, but it is not specifically about keystrokes or clipboard data.
- **B: T1037.004-RC Scripts**: This technique involves using RC scripts, which is not directly related to the question.
- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves discovering system information, which is already mentioned in the question and does not align with the next step of gathering keystrokes and clipboard data.
- **D: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting local email, which is not related to the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question requires the malware to gather keystrokes and clipboard contents, which are both directly related to the T1056.001-Keylogging and T1115-Clipboard Data techniques.
- Among the answer choices, T1056.001-Keylogging is the most relevant as it specifically targets keystrokes, which is a key part of the question.

### Final Answer: D (T1056.001-Keylogging)
