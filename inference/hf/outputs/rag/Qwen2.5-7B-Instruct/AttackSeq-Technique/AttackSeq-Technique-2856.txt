Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A PowerShell command is executed upon opening a malicious shortcut file.
2. An unknown technique occurs after the PowerShell command.
3. Asruex malware communicates with a C&C server over HTTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**, **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the malware communicates with a C&C server over HTTP.
- **Tactic: Execution**, **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates that PowerShell is used to execute commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a technique that logically follows the execution of a PowerShell command and precedes the communication with a C&C server.

- **A: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it could be used to encode the data sent to the C&C server, it doesn't necessarily follow the execution of a PowerShell command.
- **B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**: This technique involves using SSH authorized keys for authentication. It is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell or the communication with a C&C server.
- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell or the communication with a C&C server.
- **D: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary channel is blocked. Given that the malware communicates with a C&C server over HTTP, a fallback channel could be used if the primary channel is detected or blocked.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of a PowerShell command (T1059.001-PowerShell) is the initial step.
- The next step could be using a fallback channel (T1008-Fallback Channels) to ensure that if the primary HTTP communication is detected or blocked, the malware can still communicate with the C&C server.
- After the fallback channel is established, the malware can then communicate with the C&C server over HTTP (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that a fallback channel is established after the PowerShell command and before the malware communicates with the C&C server over HTTP.

**Final Answer: D: T1008-Fallback Channels**
