Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761 are used for initial access. The goal is to identify the technique that allows the BlackEnergy malware to bypass standard detection methods after initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a targeted email to gain initial access to the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This technique involves using RDP to establish a remote session. It does not directly relate to bypassing detection methods after initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This could be a plausible method to bypass standard detection after initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves using containers to execute code. It is not directly related to the scenario of bypassing detection after initial access.
- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. It does not directly relate to bypassing detection methods after initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions initial access via MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761. This aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
- The goal is to bypass standard detection methods after initial access. Among the given choices, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (Answer Choice B) is the most relevant technique for this purpose. Obfuscation can help the malware evade detection by making it harder for security tools to identify and analyze the malware.

### Final Answer: B
