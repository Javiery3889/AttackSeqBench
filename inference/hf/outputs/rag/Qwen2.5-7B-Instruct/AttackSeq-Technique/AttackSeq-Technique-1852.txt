### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where VERMIN malware uses WMI queries to gather system information.
   - The next step in the sequence is to collect sensitive information like keystrokes and clipboard data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Discovery" as the tactic and "System Information Discovery" as the technique.
   - This indicates that the malware is in the process of gathering information about the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique is about discovering network configuration details, which is not directly related to collecting keystrokes or clipboard data.
   - **B: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves accessing data stored in cloud services, which is not relevant to the context of collecting keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - **C: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to collecting keystrokes or clipboard data.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with collecting keystrokes and clipboard data.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gathering system information using WMI queries (which aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery), the next step is to collect sensitive information like keystrokes and clipboard data, which is best described by the T1056-Input Capture technique.

**Final Answer: D**
