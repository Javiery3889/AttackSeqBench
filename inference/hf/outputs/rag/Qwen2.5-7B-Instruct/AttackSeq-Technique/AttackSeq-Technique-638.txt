Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
- Moafee and DragonOK groups used custom-built backdoors and RATs to maintain access.
- 'CT/NewCT' payloads were executed with a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads using a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1497.001-System Checks**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
- This technique involves compromising software binaries on the host. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to the 'CPU core check' for evasion.

**B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- This technique involves sending a malicious link via spearphishing. It is a common initial attack vector but does not directly relate to the 'CPU core check' for evasion.

**C: T1566-Phishing**
- This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. Similar to B, it is an initial attack vector but does not directly relate to the 'CPU core check' for evasion.

**D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
- This technique involves developing capabilities to maintain access and evade detection. This could include developing custom backdoors and RATs, which aligns with the initial compromise described in the question. The 'CPU core check' for evasion is a method to further evade detection, which could be a subsequent step after developing these capabilities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where custom-built backdoors and RATs are used to maintain access, and then 'CT/NewCT' payloads are executed with a 'CPU core check' for evasion.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for defense evasion, specifically system checks and time-based evasion.
- Among the answer choices, T1587-Develop Capabilities (D) best fits the context of developing custom backdoors and RATs, which would be a prerequisite for the subsequent evasion techniques.

### Final Answer: D
