### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure.
   - DNSpionage is a known threat actor that uses DNS to redirect traffic for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which is a common initial step in reconnaissance.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for command and control, which is a step that might occur after reconnaissance.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control, which is the malicious technique mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique is closely related to T1016, as both involve gathering information about the network. However, T1016 is more specific to system and network configuration discovery.
   - **Option B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules:** This technique is not directly related to the question, as it involves hiding email content, which is not mentioned in the context of DNSpionage.
   - **Option C: T1590.005-IP Addresses:** This technique involves gathering information about IP addresses, which is a subset of network information. While it is relevant, it is less specific than T1016.
   - **Option D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs, which is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance or network configuration discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the initial reconnaissance and network configuration discovery, which aligns with T1016.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes is T1016.

**Final Answer: A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** (Note: The correct answer should be T1016, but based on the given options, T1590 is the closest match to the context of gathering network information, which is a precursor to T1016.)
