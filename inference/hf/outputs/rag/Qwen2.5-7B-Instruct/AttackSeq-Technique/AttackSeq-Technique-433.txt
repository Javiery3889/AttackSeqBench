### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware has achieved persistence through a Windows registry entry in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred as the Sednit group's malware performed reconnaissance on victim computers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention `T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder` under the Persistence tactic.
   - This indicates that the malware has already achieved persistence by adding a registry entry to ensure it runs on startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique is not related to reconnaissance or any form of active scanning or user activity checks. It is more about using chat messages for communication.
   - **B: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**
     - This technique involves the adversary checking for user activity patterns to avoid detection. While it could be part of reconnaissance, it does not directly follow from achieving persistence.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is about evading detection in virtualized environments or sandboxes. It is not directly related to reconnaissance activities.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves the adversary actively scanning the network or system to gather information. Given that the malware has achieved persistence, the next logical step would be to gather information about the victim's environment, which aligns well with reconnaissance.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after achieving persistence, the malware would perform active scanning to gather information about the victim's environment. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning
