Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Obfuscating a VBA-Macro with thematically chosen variable names.
2. Dropping a file from a specified URL.
3. Establishing communication with the URL's domain to execute 'nanagrams.exe'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish command and control (C2) communications. While it fits the context of establishing communication with a domain, it does not directly relate to the obfuscation of the VBA-Macro or the dropping of a file.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using deceptive content to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. While phishing can be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the execution of 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL.

- **C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves maintaining access to a target by using multiple methods to communicate with the attacker. While it could be relevant in a broader context, it does not directly describe the action of establishing communication with a domain to execute a file.

- **D: T1650-Acquire Access**
  - This technique involves gaining access to a system or network. While it is a broader tactic, it does not specifically describe the action of establishing communication with a domain to execute a file.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the execution of a file from a URL. The technique that best fits this description is T1059.005-Visual Basic, which involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code.

- **Obfuscating the VBA-Macro with thematically chosen variable names** aligns with the use of VBA.
- **Dropping a file from a specified URL** and **establishing communication with the URL's domain to execute 'nanagrams.exe'** are actions that fit the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.

### Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

However, upon re-evaluation, the most accurate and specific TTP that aligns with the described actions is T1059.005-Visual Basic. Therefore, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: T1059.005-Visual Basic
