Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Persistence is established by moving malware to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.
2. BLACKGEAR backdoors retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which answer choice aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
  - This technique involves searching open websites or domains, which could be used to retrieve C&C configuration information. However, it does not directly relate to the persistence techniques mentioned in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using web services to communicate with the C&C server. While it could be used to retrieve C&C configuration information, it does not directly align with the persistence techniques mentioned.

- **Answer Choice C: T1588.005-Exploits**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or perform actions. It does not directly relate to the retrieval of C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

- **Answer Choice D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data. While it could be used to encode the C&C configuration information, it does not directly relate to the retrieval process from blogs or microblogs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the retrieval of C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs, which suggests a method of accessing and downloading data from the internet.
- The related TTPs mention persistence techniques such as shortcut modification and registry run keys, which are consistent with the persistence methods described in the question.
- Among the answer choices, **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains** (Answer Choice A) is the most plausible technique for retrieving C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs, as it directly involves searching and accessing websites.

### Final Answer: A
