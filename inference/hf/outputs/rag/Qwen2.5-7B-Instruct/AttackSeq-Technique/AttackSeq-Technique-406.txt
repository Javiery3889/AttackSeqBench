Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Gholee (a malware or attacker) establishes communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests to `/index.php`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
- This TTP is about evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 server using an expired SSL certificate.

#### B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This TTP is about using application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to the communication aspect, it does not specifically mention the use of an expired SSL certificate.

#### C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates
- This TTP is specifically about using or abusing digital certificates, including expired certificates. This directly aligns with the use of an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests.

#### D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media
- This TTP is about using removable media for communication, which is not relevant to the described scenario of establishing C2 communication over the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Gholee establishes communication with a C2 server**: This aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
2. **Using an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests**: This directly relates to the use of digital certificates, specifically expired ones.
3. **T1071.001-Web Protocols** is a broader technique that could be part of the communication but does not specifically address the use of an expired SSL certificate.
4. **T1596.003-Digital Certificates** is the most specific and relevant TTP that directly addresses the use of an expired SSL certificate.

### Final Answer: C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates
