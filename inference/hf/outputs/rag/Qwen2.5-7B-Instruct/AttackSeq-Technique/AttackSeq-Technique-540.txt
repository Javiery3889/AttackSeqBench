Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PIVY establishes persistence by installing itself for automatic startup via a `.lnk` in the Windows Startup folder. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to evade detection while utilizing DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to execute the payload.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding a registry entry or a shortcut in the Startup folder to ensure the malware starts automatically with the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1200-Hardware Additions**: This technique involves adding hardware to the system, which is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.
- **B: T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting**: This technique involves manipulating security alerts to evade detection. While it could be relevant, it does not directly address the use of DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.
- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, and network connections to evade detection. It is more relevant to the described sequence as it directly addresses evading detection.
- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. It is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes PIVY establishing persistence via a `.lnk` in the Startup folder and using DLL sideloading.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of DLL sideloading (T1574.002) and persistence via the Startup folder (T1547.001).
- The question asks about evading detection while using these techniques.
- Among the answer choices, T1564-Hide Artifacts (C) is the most relevant as it directly addresses hiding artifacts to evade detection.

### Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
