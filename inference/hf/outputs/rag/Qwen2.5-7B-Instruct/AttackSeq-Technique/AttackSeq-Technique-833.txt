### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR for defense evasion and then discovered network configuration and SNS application details on the victim's PC.
   - We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the encoding of configuration files and precedes the discovery of network and application details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" and "Encrypted/Encoded File" (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File).
   - This indicates that the question is focused on techniques used to evade detection, including encoding files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly relate to the sequence of encoding files and then discovering network details.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions. It is a broad technique and does not specifically align with the sequence of encoding files and then discovering network details.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves making malicious activity appear legitimate. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not directly follow the encoding of files and precede the discovery of network details.
   - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for communication. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly follow the encoding of files and precede the discovery of network details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of encoding files and then discovering network details, is not directly provided by the options. However, the closest and most logical step after encoding files and before discovering network details would be a technique that involves network reconnaissance or data gathering.
   - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell** is the most plausible choice as it can be used for network reconnaissance and command execution, which aligns with the sequence of actions described.

### Final Answer: A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell
