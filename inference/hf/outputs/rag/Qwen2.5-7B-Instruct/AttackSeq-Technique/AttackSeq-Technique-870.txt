Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the GreyEnergy malware:
1. Stealthily deploying only selected modules to selected targets when needed.
2. Partially encrypting these modules using AES-256.
3. Using internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server for Lateral Movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique is about gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to the described actions of deploying modules, encryption, and C&C redirection.

- **B: T1564.002-Hidden Users**
  - This technique involves hiding user accounts or processes to evade detection. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly align with the described actions.

- **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. Partially encrypting modules using AES-256 is a form of obfuscation, which aligns well with this technique.

- **D: T1584.008-Network Devices**
  - This technique involves using network devices for C2. While it is related to C2, the question specifically mentions internal C&C proxies, which is more aligned with T1090.001-Internal Proxy.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the deployment of partially encrypted modules, which aligns with T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File.
- The use of internal C&C proxies for redirection to an external C&C server aligns with T1090.001-Internal Proxy.
- Among the given answer choices, T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File (C) is the most directly related to the described action of partially encrypting modules.

### Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
