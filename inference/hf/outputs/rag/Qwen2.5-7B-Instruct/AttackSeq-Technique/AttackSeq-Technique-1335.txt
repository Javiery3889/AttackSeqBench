Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the version RAT malware communicated with the C2 servers by encrypting data using AES and base64 encoding. This implies that the technique in question should be a preparatory step that enables or facilitates the communication with C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to obfuscate the data. This is relevant to the encryption and base64 encoding mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection. This is also relevant to the encryption and base64 encoding mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not directly related to the encryption and base64 encoding mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves establishing a remote service to gain access to a system. It is more about establishing a service rather than the encryption and encoding of data.
- **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to obfuscate the data. This is directly related to the base64 encoding mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
  - This technique involves staging capabilities to prepare for a future attack. It is more about preparing the environment rather than the specific encoding and encryption of data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the malware communicated with the C2 servers by encrypting data using AES and base64 encoding. This indicates that the malware needed to prepare the data for transmission.
- The related TTPs mention T1132.001-Standard Encoding, which is directly related to encoding data, and T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File, which involves encrypting or encoding files.
- Among the answer choices, T1132-Data Encoding (Choice C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the encoding aspect of the data, which is a preparatory step for the encryption and base64 encoding mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer: C
