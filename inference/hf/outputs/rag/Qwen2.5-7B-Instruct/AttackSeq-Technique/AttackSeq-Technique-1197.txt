Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where a malicious Word document is executed through a macro, which then runs "vba_macro.exe". We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial execution of the Word document.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros, which is consistent with the execution of the macro in the Word document.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided context:

- **A: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the destruction of data, which is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file or macro.
- **B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**: This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces on network devices, which is not relevant to the execution of a malicious file or macro.
- **C: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**: This technique involves the use of cloud instance metadata APIs, which is not relevant to the execution of a malicious file or macro.
- **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves the execution of code or programs by a user, which aligns with the execution of "vba_macro.exe" after the malicious Word document is executed.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial execution of the malicious Word document through a macro aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
- The execution of "vba_macro.exe" is a subsequent step in the attack sequence.
- The most plausible technique that follows the execution of "vba_macro.exe" is T1204-User Execution, as it involves the execution of code or programs by a user.

### Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
