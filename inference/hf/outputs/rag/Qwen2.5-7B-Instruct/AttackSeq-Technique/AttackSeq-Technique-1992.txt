### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy established C2 communication with `updaterweb[.]com` by sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request.
   - The key elements are:
     - C2 communication establishment
     - Exfiltration of data
     - Use of a structured POST request

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of Exfiltration and the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - T1041 is specifically about exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the question's context.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection. While it could be a step in the process, it is not directly related to the establishment of C2 communication or the exfiltration method.
   - **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
     - This technique involves using socket filters to manipulate network traffic. It could be a method to ensure the C2 communication is not detected, but it is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. This is directly related to the establishment of C2 communication and the use of a structured POST request.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering system owners or users to gain access or escalate privileges. It is not directly related to the C2 communication or exfiltration process.

### Final Answer:
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most plausible sequence of TTPs because it directly relates to the establishment of C2 communication using an application layer protocol, which aligns with the use of a structured POST request for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
