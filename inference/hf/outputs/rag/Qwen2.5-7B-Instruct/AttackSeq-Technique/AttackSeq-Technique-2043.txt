Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where BlackEnergy 3 malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API. The next step in the sequence is to enable lateral movement to other systems within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a service or feature of a remote system to gain access or perform actions.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems to facilitate lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique is directly related to the tactic of lateral movement and involves exploiting a service or feature of a remote system. Given that the malware has already gathered network information, it is plausible that the next step would be to exploit a service or feature to move laterally.
- **Option B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is not directly related to the context provided in the question, as it involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not mentioned in the sequence.
- **Option C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique is related to the tactic of lateral movement but is more about using remote services for communication rather than exploiting them.
- **Option D: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token**: This technique is more about token impersonation and is not directly related to the context of lateral movement through service exploitation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has gathered network information, which aligns with the T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery technique.
- The next step is to enable lateral movement, which aligns with the T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services technique.
- The T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer technique is also related to lateral movement but is more about transferring tools rather than exploiting services.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to first gather network information and then exploit a remote service to move laterally.

**Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
