Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime. This action is part of a persistence mechanism to ensure the Trojan remains present across reboots. The paths mentioned (e.g., `%systemroot%\system32` or `%programfiles%`) are common locations where system files and executables are stored, indicating a need to maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the DLL search order to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is a common method to maintain persistence by ensuring the malicious DLL is loaded every time a process is started.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a legitimate process to execute malicious code. While this can be used for persistence, it is more about executing code within an existing process rather than maintaining persistence across reboots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. However, the question specifically mentions dynamically loading a DLL, which is more aligned with DLL injection or search order hijacking.
- **Answer Choice B: T1110-Brute Force**: This technique involves using brute force methods to gain unauthorized access. It does not align with the described persistence mechanism.
- **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules to maintain persistence. While this can be a method, it is not as directly related to the described DLL loading mechanism.
- **Answer Choice D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique involves using the AppDomainManager to load and execute code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not as directly related to the described DLL loading mechanism.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where a Trojan dynamically loads a DLL during runtime to ensure persistence. This aligns most closely with the technique of modifying the DLL search order to load a malicious DLL, which is T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking.
- The related TTPs mention both persistence and DLL search order hijacking, further supporting this choice.

### Final Answer: C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking
