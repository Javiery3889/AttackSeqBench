Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Cobalt Strike Beacon is used for credential dumping.
2. Log files are cleared to conceal activity.
3. Processes are executed on remote computers to propagate across the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis.
- **Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
- This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, which focuses on lateral movement and evasion.

**B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
- This technique involves tainting shared content to spread malware. It does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs, which focuses on lateral movement and evasion.

**C: T1021-Remote Services**
- This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold on a remote system. While it could be part of the propagation, it does not fully capture the sequence of credential dumping and clearing logs.

**D: T1583.004-Server**
- This technique involves using a server to facilitate lateral movement. It aligns well with the described sequence of TTPs, as it involves executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Credential Dumping (T1003)**: The attackers use Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping.
- **Clearing Logs (T1070.001)**: They clear log files to conceal their activity.
- **Propagation (T1583.004)**: They execute processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1070.001 (Clearing Logs), and T1583.004 (Server) for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D**
