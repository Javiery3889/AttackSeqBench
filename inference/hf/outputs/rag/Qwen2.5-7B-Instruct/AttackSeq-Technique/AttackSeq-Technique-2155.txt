Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Phishing campaigns delivered malicious macro-laden Microsoft Word documents.
2. An unknown technique occurred after the phishing campaigns.
3. FlowCloud malware set registry key values for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves the use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute code. It is relevant to the execution phase.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves delivering malicious content via spearphishing. It is relevant to the initial access phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find a technique that logically follows the delivery of malicious Word documents and precedes the setting of registry key values for persistence.

- **A: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This technique involves calculating DNS records, which is not directly related to the execution or persistence of malware.
- **B: T1559.001-Component Object Model**: This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. It is relevant to execution but does not directly follow the delivery of malicious documents.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. It is relevant to execution but does not directly follow the delivery of malicious documents.
- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to execute code. It is relevant to execution but does not directly follow the delivery of malicious documents.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The phishing campaign delivers malicious Word documents, which is a form of initial access.
- The next step in the sequence should be an execution technique that leverages the malicious content.
- T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a technique that can be used to execute code from a malicious document, making it a plausible candidate.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that follows the delivery of malicious Word documents and precedes the setting of registry key values for persistence is T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange.

### Final Answer: B
