Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. This implies that the answer should involve techniques that help in maintaining persistence and executing commands while avoiding detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique involves creating a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**: This technique involves compromising a software binary to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This is a repetition of the persistence technique, but under the context of privilege escalation.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection. While it can be used for command execution, it does not directly address minimizing detection or maintaining persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This is relevant to minimizing detection but does not directly address command execution.
- **Answer Choice C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process to execute commands. It is relevant to command execution but does not directly address persistence or minimizing detection.
- **Answer Choice D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which can help in maintaining persistence and avoiding detection. It is relevant to both command execution and minimizing detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: Agrius achieved persistence by deploying the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which is a form of a Windows service (T1543.003).
- **Step 2**: To ensure command execution, Agrius used indirect command execution (T1202) to execute commands in a way that is less likely to be detected.
- **Step 3**: To minimize detection, Agrius would also use techniques like indicator removal (T1070) to avoid detection by security tools.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is one that involves both command execution and minimizing detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
