### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Rocket Kitten uses a keylogger to capture keystrokes and access additional victim accounts.
   - The next step in the sequence is to facilitate downloading malware intended for the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Collection" and the technique is "Keylogging" (T1056.001-Keylogging).
   - The next tactic is "Credential Access," which aligns with the step of accessing additional victim accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves using a bootkit to gain persistence and control over a system. While it can be used to download malware, it is not the most direct or common method for facilitating malware download.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. It is more about moving tools rather than downloading malware directly.
   - **C: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data or download malware. It is a plausible method for facilitating the download of malware.
   - **D: T1098-Account Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating user accounts to gain unauthorized access. While it can be part of the attack, it does not directly facilitate the download of malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitates downloading malware intended for the attack is **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**.

**Final Answer: C: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
