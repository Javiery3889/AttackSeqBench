Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers used spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents to achieve initial access. Before this, the attackers needed to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer, specifically the Microsoft Office version.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This is a broader category of phishing techniques, but it does not specifically mention gathering information about the victim's software.
- **Answer Choice B: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - This technique is more specific to gathering information from the victim, which aligns with the need to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer.
- **Answer Choice C: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**
  - This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not directly related to the scenario of gathering information through spear phishing.
- **Answer Choice D: T1648-Serverless Execution**
  - This technique is about executing code without a traditional server, which is not relevant to the initial gathering of information about the victim's software.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attackers needed to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer, including the Microsoft Office version, before achieving initial access via spear phishing.
- The related TTPs mention T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is a specific technique under T1566-Phishing.
- However, the most relevant technique for gathering information about the victim's software is T1598-Phishing for Information, as it directly addresses the need to gather information from the victim.

### Final Answer: B
