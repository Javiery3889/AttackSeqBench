Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Utilities and libraries are used to archive collected data for fraudulent transactions.
2. FIN13 exfiltrates data using web services and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique involves using utilities and libraries to archive collected data.
- **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is about signaling to a command and control server to initiate a network connection. It does not fit the context of archiving data.
- **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique directly involves archiving the collected data, which aligns with the first part of the sequence described in the question.
- **C: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection. It does not fit the context of archiving data.
- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It does not fit the context of archiving data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that utilities and libraries are used to archive collected data. This aligns with **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**.
- The related TTPs also mention **T1560-Archive Collected Data**, which is a broader technique that includes archiving data.
- The sequence of TTPs should logically start with archiving the data before exfiltrating it. Therefore, the technique that directly involves archiving the collected data is the most appropriate.

### Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data
