Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary has already copied results from the discovery phase, including file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes. The next step is to exfiltrate data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection** - This is the general tactic that encompasses the process of gathering data.
- **Technique: T1119-Automated Collection** - This technique involves the use of automated tools to collect data.
- **Tactic: Discovery** - This is the tactic that involves identifying the target's network and systems.
- **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique involves identifying files and directories on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1114-Email Collection** - This technique involves collecting email data. While it is related to data collection, it does not specifically mention file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes, which are mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1080-Taint Shared Content** - This technique involves marking content as malicious or sensitive. It does not directly relate to the data collection or exfiltration process described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** - This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. While it is related to data access, it does not specifically mention the custom-built tool or cloud storage web services.
- **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to data. It is more aligned with the exfiltration process, but it does not directly address the data collection phase described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary has already discovered and copied data (file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes).
- The next step is to exfiltrate this data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.
- Among the given choices, **T1119-Automated Collection** (not explicitly listed in the choices but implied by the context) is the most relevant technique as it involves the use of automated tools to collect and potentially exfiltrate data.

However, since T1119 is not in the choices, the closest and most plausible choice based on the context and the related TTPs is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**, as it involves the use of tools to access and potentially exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer: D
