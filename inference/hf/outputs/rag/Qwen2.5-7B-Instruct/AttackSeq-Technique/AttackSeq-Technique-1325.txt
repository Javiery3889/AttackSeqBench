### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes CosmicDuke conducting discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including non-English filenames.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to gather information from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," and the technique is "T1083-File and Directory Discovery."
   - This indicates that the attack is focused on gathering information about the victim's system through file and directory exploration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs. While it can be used to gather information, it is not directly related to the file and directory discovery described in the question.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves accessing and exfiltrating clipboard data. It is not directly related to the file and directory discovery described in the question.
   - **C: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**
     - This technique involves loading and using kernel modules or extensions. While it can be used to gather information, it is not directly related to the file and directory discovery described in the question.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it can be used to gather information, it is not directly related to the file and directory discovery described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of file and directory discovery, none of the provided answer choices directly align with the next step in the attack sequence. However, if we must choose the most plausible option based on the provided choices, we should consider which one is most likely to be used in conjunction with file and directory discovery to gather additional information.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture (D)** is the most plausible choice because it can provide visual information about the system, which can be useful in conjunction with file and directory discovery to understand the environment better.

### Final Answer: D
