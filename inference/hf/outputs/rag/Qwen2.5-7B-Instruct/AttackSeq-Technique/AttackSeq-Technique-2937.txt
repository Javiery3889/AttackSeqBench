### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions Rocket Kitten using hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests from GHOLE malware for C&C communication.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the technique is "T1071.001-Web Protocols" (which is part of the Web Protocols sub-technique of Application Layer Protocol).
   - This suggests that the communication is happening over a web protocol, likely HTTP or HTTPS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the C&C communication described.
   - **B: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for C&C communication, it is not the most direct follow-up to the initial C&C communication.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the C&C communication described.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C&C communication. Given that the initial communication was over a web protocol (GET requests), it is logical that the next step would be to continue using the same protocol for further communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
