Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host.
2. An unknown TTP occurred after the execution of arbitrary code.
3. The final TTP collected files, keystrokes, and screenshots from the victim's system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection Tactic**: This indicates that the final TTP is part of the data collection process.
- **Techniques**:
  - **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes.
  - **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices fits logically between the execution of arbitrary code and the collection of files, keystrokes, and screenshots.

- **A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique is not directly related to the collection of files, keystrokes, or screenshots. It is more about intercepting multi-factor authentication mechanisms, which does not fit the sequence described.
- **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique encompasses keylogging (T1056.001), which is directly related to capturing keystrokes. This fits well as a step between executing arbitrary code and collecting keystrokes.
- **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It is more about data transmission rather than data collection, so it does not fit the sequence.
- **D: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using stolen hashes to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the collection of files, keystrokes, or screenshots, so it does not fit the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of arbitrary code is the initial step.
- The next step should be a technique that captures keystrokes, which is directly related to T1056.001-Keylogging.
- The final step is the collection of files, keystrokes, and screenshots, which aligns with the related TTPs.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Execution of arbitrary code
2. T1056.001-Keylogging (capturing keystrokes)
3. Collection of files, keystrokes, and screenshots

### Final Answer: B
