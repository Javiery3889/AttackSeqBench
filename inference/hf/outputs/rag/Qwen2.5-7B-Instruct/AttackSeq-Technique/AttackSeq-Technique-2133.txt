Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. 'install.vbs' is executed (heavily obfuscated).
2. 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using a Visual Basic Scripting Engine to execute scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the file deletion or script execution described.
- **B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This technique involves bypassing security software, which is more about evading detection rather than the specific actions described.
- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. T1059.005-Visual Basic is a sub-technique of this, which aligns with the use of 'install.vbs'.
- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is more about hiding evidence rather than the specific actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **'install.vbs' is executed**: This aligns with T1059.005-Visual Basic, which is a sub-technique of T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
2. **'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'**: This aligns with T1070.004-File Deletion, which is a sub-technique of T1070-Indicator Removal.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that 'install.vbs' is executed (T1059.005-Visual Basic) before 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' (T1070.004-File Deletion).

However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **before** 'stopedge.bat' deleted the files. The technique that directly precedes the file deletion in the sequence is the execution of the script.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:
Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
