Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. GreyEnergy operators used spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers for initial access.
2. After initial access, they deployed modular malware functionalities dependent on specific combinations of modules uploaded to victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1087.001-Local Account**
  - This technique involves using a local account to gain access to a system. It does not directly relate to the initial access via spearphishing or exploiting public-facing applications.

- **Answer Choice B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing capabilities to support the adversary's objectives. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly fit the sequence of initial access and deployment of modular malware.

- **Answer Choice C: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to a system. It does not directly relate to the initial access via spearphishing or exploiting public-facing applications.

- **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. It aligns well with the use of compromised public-facing web servers (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and spearphishing (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) for initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers for initial access.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link for initial access.
- The sequence of TTPs should logically follow the initial access techniques.
- Among the answer choices, T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services (Answer Choice D) is the most relevant and plausible technique that could occur before deploying modular malware functionalities.

### Final Answer: D
