### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary gains Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used when the adversary, FamousSparrow, executed SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Exploit Public-Facing Application" (T1190). This indicates that the attack starts with exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system's configuration, such as network topology, services, and software versions. While it could be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**
     - This technique involves changing the policies of a domain or tenant to gain additional privileges or control. It is more about modifying the environment rather than exploiting a specific vulnerability.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client system. Given that the question mentions exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities, this technique aligns well with the described attack sequence.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This choice is incomplete and does not provide a full ATT&CK technique, making it an invalid option.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**, as it directly relates to exploiting the vulnerabilities to execute code on the compromised systems.

**Final Answer: C**
