### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Mustang Panda used benign executables to side-load malicious DLLs for deploying the PlugX implant.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial execution method.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the following techniques:
     - T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (which is already mentioned in the question)
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation
     - Tactic: Persistence
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (A):** This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when a system boots or when a user logs on. While this is a persistence technique, it is not directly related to the initial side-loading of DLLs.
   - **T1037.003-Network Logon Script (B):** This technique involves using network logon scripts to execute malicious code. This is more related to network-based persistence and not directly to the side-loading of DLLs.
   - **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification (C):** This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code. This could be a method to ensure persistence after the initial side-loading of DLLs, but it is not as directly related to the initial execution method as other options.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules (D):** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. This is closely related to the initial side-loading of DLLs, and it can be used to ensure that the malicious DLLs are loaded and executed persistently.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve ensuring that the malicious DLLs are loaded and executed persistently after the initial side-loading. The technique that best fits this requirement is T1129-Shared Modules, as it directly relates to the use of shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code.

**Final Answer: D**
