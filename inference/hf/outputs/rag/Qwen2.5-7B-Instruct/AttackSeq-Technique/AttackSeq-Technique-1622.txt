Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT28 during an attack. Specifically, it mentions:
- Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
- Centralizing the information as part of the Discovery tactic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and classifying systems on the network.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP ranges to identify open ports and services.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique is about discovering and enumerating containers and resources, which does not directly fit the sequence of scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
- **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over non-standard protocols, which is not relevant to the initial scanning and identification phase.
- **C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This technique involves accessing process memory, which is not directly related to the initial scanning and identification phase.
- **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and classifying systems on the network, which aligns with the scanning and identification of vulnerable systems as part of the Discovery tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Scanning IP Ranges and Identifying Vulnerable Systems**: This is described in the question and aligns with T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks.
2. **Centralizing the Information**: This is part of the Discovery tactic, and T1018-Remote System Discovery fits this step as it involves identifying and classifying systems on the network.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Scanning IP ranges (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks) → Identifying and classifying systems (T1018-Remote System Discovery) → Centralizing the information.

### Final Answer: D
