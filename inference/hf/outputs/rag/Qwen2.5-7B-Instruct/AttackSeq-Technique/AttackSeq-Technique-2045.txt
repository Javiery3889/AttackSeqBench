Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attackers conducted reconnaissance using fake personas on social media.
2. They gained initial access by sending spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the initial access phase:
- **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using a service to deliver spear-phishing emails.
- **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique is similar to T1598.001 but specifically mentions using a service.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This is a broader technique that includes spear-phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP most likely occurred before the spear-phishing messages were sent. The reconnaissance phase involves gathering information, and the initial access phase involves sending the spear-phishing messages.

- **A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which doesn't seem to fit the context of reconnaissance or initial access.
- **B: T1003.007-Proc Filesystem**: This technique involves processing files, which is not directly related to reconnaissance or initial access.
- **C: T1587.001-Malware**: This technique involves using malware, which is not directly related to reconnaissance or initial access.
- **D: T1585-Establish Accounts**: This technique involves establishing accounts, which could be a step in reconnaissance or initial access. Creating accounts on social media or other services to gather information or to send spear-phishing messages aligns well with the context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers conducted reconnaissance by using fake personas on social media, which is a form of establishing accounts.
- After establishing these accounts, they likely used these accounts to send spear-phishing messages.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Establishing accounts (T1585-Establish Accounts)
2. Sending spear-phishing messages (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service or T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service)

### Final Answer: D
