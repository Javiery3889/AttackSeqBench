Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Secure communication with a C&C server over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels.
2. Archiving and transmitting sensitive information.
3. Utilizing legitimate cloud services for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the same channel (C2) for exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This technique involves using an alternative protocol for exfiltration, which does not align with the use of the same C2 channel for exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
  - This technique involves extracting data from a configuration repository, which is not directly related to the exfiltration process described.
- **Answer Choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves using a web service for exfiltration, which could be a plausible method but does not directly align with the use of the same C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice D: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves using cloud accounts for exfiltration, which aligns well with the use of legitimate cloud services for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of a C2 channel for both communication and exfiltration.
- The related TTPs mention the use of web protocols for C2 communication and exfiltration over the same channel.
- Among the answer choices, T1585.003-Cloud Accounts is the most plausible because it involves using cloud services, which aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: D
