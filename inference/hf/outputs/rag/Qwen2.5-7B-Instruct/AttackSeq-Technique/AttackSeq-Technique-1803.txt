### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where configuration files are encoded using single-byte XOR keys, and the target is websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to disrupt these websites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" as the tactic and "Encrypted/Encoded File" and "Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information" as techniques.
   - This indicates that the attackers are using techniques to hide or obfuscate their activities, which aligns with the encoding of configuration files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
     - This technique involves adding malicious entries to the system's autostart mechanism to ensure persistence. It does not directly relate to encoding or disrupting websites.
   - **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves disrupting network services, which could be a plausible method to disrupt websites. However, it does not directly address the encoding of configuration files.
   - **C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with requests to exhaust resources. While it could disrupt services, it does not directly address the encoding of configuration files.
   - **D: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
     - This technique involves manipulating domain properties to redirect traffic or perform other actions. It does not directly address the encoding of configuration files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of encoding configuration files and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the attackers using techniques to hide or obfuscate their activities, which aligns with the encoding of configuration files.
   - The technique that best fits this context is **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**, which is already listed as a related TTP.

However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs include "Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information," the sequence should involve both encoding and decoding. The closest match in the given choices is not explicitly listed, but the most relevant technique is **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**.

**Final Answer: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant based on the given context and related TTPs.)
