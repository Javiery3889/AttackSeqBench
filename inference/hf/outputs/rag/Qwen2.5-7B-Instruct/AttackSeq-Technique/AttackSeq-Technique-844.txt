Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by a threat actor:
1. WinDealer discovered information about the victim's PC.
2. The stolen data was saved as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory.
3. The data was staged for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input through GUI elements. It does not align with the described actions of saving stolen data and staging it for exfiltration.

- **B: T1074-Data Staged**
  - This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration. While it is relevant, it does not specifically describe the action of saving data in the %TEMP% directory.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It does not align with the described actions of saving data and staging it for exfiltration.

- **D: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**
  - This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration by transferring it to a remote location. It is more specific to the action of staging data for exfiltration, but it does not directly address the saving of data in the %TEMP% directory.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible TTP that aligns with the described actions of saving stolen data in the %TEMP% directory and then staging it for exfiltration is **T1074-Data Staged**. Although it does not specifically mention the %TEMP% directory, it is the closest match to the overall action of preparing data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: T1074-Data Staged**
