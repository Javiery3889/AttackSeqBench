### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' to collect system information, including browser history and external IP addresses, before deploying persistence modules.
   - The focus is on the reconnaissance phase, specifically during victim network discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques for discovering system network configurations and system information, which aligns with the question's description of collecting browser history and external IP addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies** - This technique is about identifying and exploiting trust relationships between systems, which does not directly match the described TTPs.
   - **B: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller** - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to manipulate network trust relationships, which is not relevant to the described TTPs.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This technique is about the automated exfiltration of data from the victim network, which is not the focus of the described TTPs.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** - This technique involves gathering information about the victim network, which aligns with the described TTPs of collecting system information, including browser history and external IP addresses.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
