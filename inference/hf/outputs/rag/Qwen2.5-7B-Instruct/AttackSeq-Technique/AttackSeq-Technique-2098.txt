### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access via the Inception Framework exploiting RTF files with CVE-2014-1761.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique facilitated communication with a cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is relevant as it describes how the attacker initially gains access.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This is relevant as it describes the method used to exploit the RTF files.
   - **Execution (Tactic):** This is relevant as it describes the execution of the exploit.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (Technique):** This is relevant as it describes the execution of the exploit for client-side execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols for C2 communication. Given the context of cloud-based infrastructure, this is a plausible choice.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain access. Since the question already mentions initial access via exploiting RTF files, phishing is less likely to be the answer.
   - **C: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols, which is not directly related to the communication for C2 operations.
   - **D: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves bidirectional communication, which is a plausible choice for C2 operations but is more specific than the general communication technique.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated communication with a cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control operations is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
