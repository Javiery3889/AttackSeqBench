Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. GroundPeony utilized spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs to deliver malicious payloads.
2. The next step is to be identified.
3. The final step is evading defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is mentioned explicitly in the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique is also mentioned in the question, as the spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs are part of this technique.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the spear-phishing and obfuscation and precedes DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

- **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil**: This technique involves using a utility to install software. It does not seem to fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the spear-phishing or DLL side-loading.
- **B: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler. While it can be used for scheduling tasks, it does not directly relate to the spear-phishing or DLL side-loading.
- **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services. It is not directly related to the spear-phishing or DLL side-loading.
- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules. This is a plausible candidate as it can be used in the context of DLL side-loading, which is mentioned as the final step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) are used to deliver malicious payloads.
- The next step, which is not explicitly mentioned but logically follows, is likely to be the execution of the malicious payload.
- The execution of the payload can involve the use of shared modules (T1129-Shared Modules), which can then be used in the context of DLL side-loading (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) to evade detection.

### Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
