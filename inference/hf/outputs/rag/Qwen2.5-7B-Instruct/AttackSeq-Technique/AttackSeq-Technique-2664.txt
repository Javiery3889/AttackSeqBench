Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives.
2. It then establishes encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using protocols that are not application-layer protocols (e.g., using TCP for command and control).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided related TTPs:

- **A: T1608-Stage Capabilities**: This technique is about the attacker's ability to stage capabilities on the target system. It does not directly relate to the communication aspect described in the question.
- **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports, which could be part of the encrypted communication. However, the question specifies a custom TCP-based protocol, which is more specific than just a non-standard port.
- **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process. It does not align with the communication aspect described in the question.
- **D: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for encrypted communication, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not directly align with the custom TCP-based protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
- The related TTPs mention **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**, which aligns with using a custom protocol.
- Among the answer choices, **T1571-Non-Standard Port** is the closest to the concept of using a custom protocol, as it involves non-standard communication methods, which can include custom protocols.

### Final Answer: B
