### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" and specifically "T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder." This indicates that the implant is ensuring persistence by placing a binary in the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
     - This technique involves using reversible encryption to obfuscate data. While it could be used in conjunction with persistence, it does not directly describe the action of placing a binary in the startup folder.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves placing a file in the startup folder or registry to ensure the file runs at boot or logon. This aligns closely with the action of downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks**
     - This technique involves checking the system to ensure the implant is running. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the action of placing a binary in the startup folder.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It does not align with the action of placing a binary in the startup folder.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the action of downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B**
