### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access campaign where attackers used a zero-day vulnerability to target users through a compromised Veteran of Foreign Wars website.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Drive-by Compromise" (T1189).
   - Drive-by Compromise (T1189) is a technique where attackers compromise a website to deliver malicious content to users who visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It is not directly related to the initial compromise or the sequence of actions following the initial access.
   - **B: T1199-Trusted Relationship** - This technique involves attackers exploiting a trusted relationship to gain access to a system. While it can be a part of an attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions following the initial access through a compromised website.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** - This technique is directly related to the compromise of a website to deliver malicious content. However, the question asks for what occurred after the initial access, not during it.
   - **D: T1608.001-Upload Malware** - This technique involves attackers uploading malware to a system. Given that the initial access was through a compromised website, the next logical step would be to upload malware to the victim's system to establish a foothold and maintain persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1608.001-Upload Malware
