Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attacker evades CPU core checks.
2. Utilizes large null-padded files.
3. Emits network beacons using hardcoded header values and encrypted data for communication with the server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This technique involves using encrypted or encoded files to evade detection.
- T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to execute them.
- T1027.001-Binary Padding: This technique involves padding binary files to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. It does not directly relate to the network beaconing or encrypted data communication described in the question.

- **B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique involves using mail protocols to exfiltrate data or deliver malware. It does not align with the network beaconing and encrypted data communication described in the question.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. While it could be related to network communication, it does not specifically mention hardcoded header values or encrypted data.

- **D: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**
  - This technique involves using network logon scripts for C2 communication. It does not directly align with the network beaconing and encrypted data communication described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attacker uses large null-padded files and encrypted data for network communication. This aligns with T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.
- The network beaconing and hardcoded header values suggest a technique that involves custom network protocols or application layer protocols for C2 communication.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File (for the large null-padded files and encrypted data)
- T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (for the hardcoded header values and encrypted data)

However, the question asks for a single technique that best fits the described sequence. The closest match is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the network beaconing and encrypted data communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
