Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Process hollowing is used to inject malicious code.
2. The malware then obfuscates its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1055.012-Process Hollowing: This technique is already mentioned in the question and is the first step in the sequence.
- T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique is mentioned as the second step, where the malware disguises its payload as an image file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns with the sequence described in the question:
- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique fits the second step in the sequence, where the malware disguises its payload as an image file.
- **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **C: T1561-Disk Wipe**: This technique is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
- **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where process hollowing is used to inject malicious code.
2. The malware then obfuscates its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file.
3. Among the given answer choices, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (A) is the only technique that fits the second step in the sequence.

### Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
