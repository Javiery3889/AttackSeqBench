Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR.
2. The compressed data was exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection Tactic, T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This TTP involves using a utility to archive data, which aligns with the use of WinRAR to compress the data.
- **Exfiltration Tactic, T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This TTP involves exfiltrating data to a cloud storage service, which aligns with the exfiltration to a Dropbox account.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This TTP involves scheduling the transfer of data at a later time. The question does not mention any scheduling, so this does not fit the sequence.
- **B: T1584.001-Domains**: This TTP involves the use of domains for command and control or data exfiltration. The question does not mention any domain usage, so this does not fit the sequence.
- **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This TTP involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which is similar to exfiltrating data to a cloud storage service like Dropbox. However, the specific technique T1567.002 is more precise.
- **D: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**: This TTP involves retrieving data from a cloud storage service, which is not mentioned in the question. The question is about exfiltration, not retrieval.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the compression of data using WinRAR and the exfiltration to Dropbox using cURL.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of a utility for archiving (WinRAR) and exfiltration to a cloud storage service (Dropbox).
- The most precise TTP that matches the exfiltration to Dropbox is T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage.

### Final Answer: C
