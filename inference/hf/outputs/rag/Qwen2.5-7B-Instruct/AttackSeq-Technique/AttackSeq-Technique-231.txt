### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where backdoors are deployed as services, obfuscation is used with encrypted configuration files, and secure communication with C2 servers is established.
   - The focus is on the secure communication aspect, which is a part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to hide the content of files, which aligns with the obfuscation using encrypted configuration files.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves having alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique is about using multiple communication channels, which could be relevant for maintaining persistence and evading detection. However, it does not directly address the secure communication aspect.
   - **B: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation:** This technique involves manipulating the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence. It does not directly address secure communication.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain secure communication, which directly addresses the need for secure communication with C2 servers.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or maintain persistence. It does not directly address secure communication.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with establishing secure communication with C2 servers is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

Final Answer: C
