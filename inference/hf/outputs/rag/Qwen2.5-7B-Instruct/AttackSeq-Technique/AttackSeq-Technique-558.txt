### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware has upgraded a malicious executable with Dropbox API interactions and bypassed UAC.
   - The final part of the question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely ensured long-term access to affected systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** This is relevant as the malware bypassed UAC, which is a form of privilege escalation.
   - **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** This is not directly relevant to the question as it pertains to moving laterally within a network, not maintaining long-term access on a single system.
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** The technique T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control is mentioned, which aligns with the bypassing of UAC.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not directly relate to maintaining long-term access.
   - **B: T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts:** This technique involves using scripts that run during system boot or logon to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible method for maintaining long-term access.
   - **C: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. While it can be used for maintaining persistence, it is not as directly related to the initial context of the question.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves adding malicious code to autostart locations to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts or a user logs on. This is a strong candidate for maintaining long-term access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures long-term access to affected systems, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: D**
