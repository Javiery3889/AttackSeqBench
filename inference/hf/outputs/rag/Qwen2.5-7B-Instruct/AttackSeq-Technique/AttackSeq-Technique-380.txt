Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering intelligence using leaked-data search engines and forums.
2. Acquiring new PoS and ATM skimmers.
3. Acquiring social engineering toolkits for social engineering attacks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1593.002-Search Engines**: This technique involves using search engines to gather information, which aligns with the use of SheYun and CnSeu.
- **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using spearphishing services, which could be part of the social engineering toolkit.
- **T1597-Search Closed Sources**: This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources, which could be relevant to gathering intelligence from forums and other restricted sources.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1597-Search Closed Sources**: This technique is relevant to the use of forums and other closed sources for gathering intelligence. However, it does not directly address the acquisition of PoS and ATM skimmers or social engineering toolkits.
- **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves acquiring the means to perform an attack, which could include acquiring PoS and ATM skimmers and social engineering toolkits. This seems to be the most comprehensive technique that covers the acquisition of both physical and software-based capabilities.
- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malware or other malicious code at boot or logon. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly address the acquisition of PoS and ATM skimmers or social engineering toolkits.
- **D: T1584.005-Botnet**: This technique involves using a botnet to perform attacks. While a botnet could be used to distribute skimmers or social engineering toolkits, it does not directly address the acquisition of these tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include gathering intelligence, acquiring physical and software-based tools, and preparing for social engineering attacks.
- The related TTPs mention search engines and spearphishing services, which are relevant to gathering intelligence.
- The most comprehensive technique that covers the acquisition of both physical and software-based capabilities is T1588-Obtain Capabilities.

### Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
