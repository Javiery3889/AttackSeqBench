Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini.
2. Leveraging Nmap and Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator privileges.
3. Performing lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This suggests that the attackers developed or used tools for their operations.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This indicates the use of tools for moving laterally within the network.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This suggests the use of domain accounts for initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it is relevant to the initial access phase, it does not directly describe the lateral movement using tools like PsExec and WinExe.
- **B: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold. It is not directly related to the use of tools for lateral movement.
- **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using spearphishing to gain access to internal systems. It is not directly related to the use of tools for lateral movement.
- **D: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**: This technique involves using WMI event subscriptions to execute code. While it is a technique for lateral movement, it is not directly related to the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
- The related TTPs mention the use of tools for lateral movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer).
- Among the answer choices, **T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription** (D) is the closest to the use of tools for lateral movement, but it is not the most direct match.
- The most direct match to the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement is not explicitly listed, but the closest related technique is **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**.

Given the options provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not directly listed, but the closest match is:

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services** (Although it is not the exact match, it is the closest to the use of tools for lateral movement among the given options).
