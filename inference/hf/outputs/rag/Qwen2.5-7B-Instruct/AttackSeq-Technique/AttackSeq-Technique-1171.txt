### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of WellMess or WellMail malware to upload/download files and execute commands on the victim's system.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated secure communication with the C2 servers for APT29.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves maintaining a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between the attacker and the victim's system.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to the victim's system, which aligns with the use of WellMess or WellMail malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It does not directly relate to maintaining secure communication with C2 servers.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages. It is not relevant to the secure communication aspect described in the question.
   - **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique directly relates to maintaining a persistent, bidirectional communication channel, which is crucial for secure communication with C2 servers.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain communication. While it is related to secure communication, it is more specific than the bidirectional communication needed for the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated secure communication with the C2 servers for APT29, given the context of using WellMess or WellMail malware to upload/download files and execute commands, is **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**.

Final Answer: C
