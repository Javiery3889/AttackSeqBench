To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question mentions that Regin has gathered information on processes and memory utilization. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before its advanced collection capabilities such as capturing screenshots or taking control of mouse functionality.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs and the question:

- **A: T1614-System Location Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering the geographical location of a system. It does not directly relate to the process and memory utilization mentioned in the question.
  
- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, and other artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a collection technique, it does not directly relate to the process and memory utilization mentioned.
  
- **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering files and directories on a system. It is closely related to the process and memory utilization mentioned, as it involves gathering information about the system's state.
  
- **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets, which is more related to authentication and authorization rather than the process and memory utilization mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that Regin gathered information on processes and memory utilization, which is a form of system state information.
- T1083-File and Directory Discovery (C) is the most relevant technique as it involves discovering files and directories, which can include system processes and memory usage.
- The other techniques (A, B, and D) do not directly relate to the process and memory utilization mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer: C
