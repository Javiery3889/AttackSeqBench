Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Decoding and executing a base64 encoded PowerShell script in 'sdmc.jpg'.
2. The goal is to hinder detection and conceal malicious components before proceeding to the command and control phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating commands to avoid detection.
  - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to execute them.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - This technique involves intercepting paths by unquoted paths, which is not directly related to the decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script.

- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it is related to obfuscation, it does not specifically mention command obfuscation or decoding.

- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control server. It is not directly related to the decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script.

- **D: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not related to the decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions decoding a base64 encoded PowerShell script, which aligns with the technique of deobfuscating or decoding files or information (T1140).
- The goal is to hinder detection and conceal malicious components, which aligns with the technique of command obfuscation (T1027.010).

Given the related TTPs and the specific actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the combination of T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) and T1027.010 (Command Obfuscation).

### Final Answer: B
