### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving SparrowDoor, which is used for reading file contents for data collection.
   - The sequence ends with communication with a C&C server for data exfiltration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique was used when SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Exfiltration" and the technique "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel."
   - T1041 specifically refers to exfiltrating data over a command and control (C&C) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection** - This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or modify its behavior. It does not directly relate to exfiltrating data over a C&C channel.
   - **B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations** - This technique involves determining the physical location of a target. It is not relevant to the exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with a C&C server. While it could be part of the exfiltration process, it does not specifically describe the method of exfiltration.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling** - This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols, which can be used to exfiltrate data over a C&C channel. However, it is more about the method of tunneling rather than the specific exfiltration technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question specifically mentions exfiltration over a C&C channel, the most relevant and direct technique is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - None of the provided answer choices directly match T1041, but the closest and most relevant technique in the list is T1573-Encrypted Channel, as it involves securing the communication channel, which is a common practice in exfiltration.

### Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
