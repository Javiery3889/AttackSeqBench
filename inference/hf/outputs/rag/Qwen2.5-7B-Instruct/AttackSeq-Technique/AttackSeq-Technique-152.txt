Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Credentials are captured through keylogging and OS credential dumping techniques.
2. The attackers then use a PowerLess Backdoor to perform lateral movement within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate to a system, which is not directly related to the sequence of capturing credentials and then using a backdoor for lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice B: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying and enumerating accounts and their associated information. While it is related to credential access, it does not directly follow the sequence of capturing credentials and then using a backdoor for lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice C: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This is the same as Answer Choice B, so it is not a valid choice for evaluation.

- **Answer Choice D: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**
  - This technique involves using a password filter DLL to modify or filter password hashes. This could be a step that occurs after capturing credentials and before using a backdoor for lateral movement, as it involves manipulating the credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes capturing credentials through keylogging and OS credential dumping.
- The attackers then use a PowerLess Backdoor for lateral movement.
- Among the given choices, T1556.002-Password Filter DLL (Answer Choice D) is the most plausible technique that could occur between capturing credentials and using a backdoor for lateral movement. It involves manipulating the credentials, which is a logical step in the sequence.

### Final Answer: D
