### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Gamaredon first uses obfuscated files and information to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.
   - The sequence then progresses to a technique that automatically lists interesting files for exfiltration purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique aligns with the initial step of using obfuscated files and information to deactivate security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique is relevant to the final step of automatically listing interesting files for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1112-Modify Registry**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to evade detection or maintain persistence. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the use of obfuscated files and information to deactivate security mechanisms.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting file permissions to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the use of obfuscated files or the listing of files for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
     - This technique involves planting a list of files or directories to be exfiltrated. It directly aligns with the final step of automatically listing interesting files for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it can be part of the attack, it does not directly follow the use of obfuscated files and information to deactivate security mechanisms.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using obfuscated files and information to deactivate security mechanisms, the next step would be to plant a list of files for exfiltration. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
