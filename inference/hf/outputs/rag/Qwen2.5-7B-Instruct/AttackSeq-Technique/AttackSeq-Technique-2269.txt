Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence that starts with emails impersonating Mexico's tax department, leading victims to download a malicious attachment. This indicates an initial access technique followed by the execution of a malicious file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves sending a malicious attachment to a victim, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**
  - This technique involves executing a malicious file, which is the next step after the victim downloads the attachment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1187-Forced Authentication**
  - This technique involves requiring the victim to authenticate in a way that is not expected or normal. It does not align with the described attack sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence.
- **Answer Choice C: T1114-Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting email addresses or other email-related information, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence.
- **Answer Choice D: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**
  - This technique involves exploiting trust relationships within a network, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence starts with emails impersonating Mexico's tax department, which is a form of initial access.
- The next step is the victim downloading a malicious attachment, which is a form of execution.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is the initial access technique, and T1204.002-Malicious File is the execution technique.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the initial access followed by the execution of a malicious file.

**Final Answer: D**
