Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware has been concealed through defense evasion techniques, such as hiding files with attributes and using a sophisticated installer. The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with a command and control (C2) server at 160.20.147.254.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique also involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique is not directly related to establishing C2 communication or using non-standard ports.
- **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection, which is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
- **C: T1505.002-Transport Agent**: This technique involves using a transport agent to exfiltrate data, which is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
- **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication, which aligns with the related TTPs and the question's context of establishing communication with a C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the concealment of malware and the establishment of C2 communication.
- The related TTPs mention the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
- Among the answer choices, T1571-Non-Standard Port is the only one that directly relates to establishing C2 communication using non-standard ports.

### Final Answer: D: T1571-Non-Standard Port
