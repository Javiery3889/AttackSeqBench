Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware first gains access to the victim system and then rewrites itself to the `%Temp%` folder with a randomized filename. The key part of the question is identifying which technique was used to gain access to the victim system before the malware executed its backdoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which could be a part of the malware's lifecycle but does not directly indicate how the malware initially gained access.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the malware discovering files and directories on the system, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but does not directly indicate the initial access method.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves the execution of commands through an intermediary, which could be a method to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Exploitation, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique involves archiving data using a utility, which is not directly related to gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique could be used to gain initial access, but it is more about executing commands through an intermediary rather than exploiting a specific vulnerability.
- **B: T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique is not related to gaining initial access.
- **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking the user into providing credentials or downloading malware, which is a common method for gaining initial access.
- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which is a common method for gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question asks about the technique used to gain initial access to the victim system.
- **Step 2**: The related TTPs include techniques that could be used to gain initial access, such as exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) or using phishing (T1566).
- **Step 3**: Among the answer choices, T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) and T1566 (Phishing) are the most relevant.
- **Step 4**: Both T1190 and T1566 are plausible methods for gaining initial access, but T1190 is more specific to exploiting a known vulnerability, which is a common method in many cyber attacks.

### Final Answer: D
