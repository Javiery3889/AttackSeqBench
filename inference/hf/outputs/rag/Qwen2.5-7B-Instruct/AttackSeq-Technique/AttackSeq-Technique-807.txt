Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Victims are lured with a spear-phishing email.
2. They download a compressed malicious Windows shortcut file.
3. GOLDBACKDOOR uses a multi-stage process and obfuscated PowerShell scripts to bypass antivirus detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link in a spear-phishing email to deliver malware.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file, which aligns with the compressed malicious Windows shortcut file mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load malicious code. While it is a technique for execution, it does not directly relate to the spear-phishing aspect mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. However, the question specifically mentions a spear-phishing email, which is a more targeted form of phishing.
- **C: T1070.010-Relocate Malware**: This technique involves moving malware to a new location. It does not fit the sequence as it is not mentioned in the question and does not directly relate to the initial access or execution steps.
- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. It aligns with the multi-stage process and obfuscated PowerShell scripts mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spear-phishing email (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) lures the victim to download a compressed malicious Windows shortcut file.
- After the download, the compressed file is executed, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
- GOLDBACKDOOR then uses a multi-stage process and obfuscated PowerShell scripts to bypass antivirus detection, which aligns with T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

### Final Answer: D
