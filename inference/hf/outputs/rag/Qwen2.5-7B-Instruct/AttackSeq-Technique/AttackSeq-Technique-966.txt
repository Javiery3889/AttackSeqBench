Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Staging internal reconnaissance data (system architecture and open TCP/UDP tables).
2. Securely transmitting this data to a C&C domain.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Command and Control (C2)**: T1071.004-DNS, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
- This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be used in the transmission, it doesn't directly address the secure transmission to a C&C domain.

**B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
- This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It doesn't fit the context of securely transmitting data to a C&C domain.

**C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
- This technique involves using encrypted channels to exfiltrate data. It aligns well with the secure transmission to a C&C domain, which is a common practice to avoid detection.

**D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
- This technique involves gathering system information. While it fits the initial reconnaissance phase, it doesn't address the secure transmission to a C&C domain.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the secure transmission of data to a C&C domain, which is a key aspect of the exfiltration phase.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for command and control and exfiltration, particularly T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
- Among the answer choices, T1573-Encrypted Channel (C) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the secure transmission of data.

### Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
