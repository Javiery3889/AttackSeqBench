Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. CVE-2015-1701 is exploited for Local Privilege Escalation.
2. The SLUB backdoor is ensured to remain active upon system startup.
3. Discovery using GitHub gists is conducted afterward.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation**
- **Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation** (already mentioned in the question)
- **Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** (directly related to ensuring the backdoor remains active upon system startup)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique ensures the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - This technique is not directly related to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup. It is more about securing authentication mechanisms.

- **B: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
  - This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load code into the Windows shell. While it can be used to ensure persistence, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and is less common for ensuring a backdoor remains active.

- **C: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not related to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.

- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves ensuring that malware or backdoors are executed at boot or logon. The sub-technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and directly aligns with ensuring the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the SLUB backdoor needs to remain active upon system startup.
- The related TTPs mention T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is a sub-technique of T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.
- Among the given answer choices, only T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (and its sub-technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) aligns with the requirement to ensure the backdoor remains active upon system startup.

### Final Answer: D
