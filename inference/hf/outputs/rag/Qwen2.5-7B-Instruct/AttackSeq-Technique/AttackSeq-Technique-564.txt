Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malware collects basic system and Bitcoin wallet information.
2. This is followed by logging activities like screen recording and keylogging.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** - This technique involves the collection of keystrokes, which aligns with the keylogging mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the collection of basic system and Bitcoin wallet information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1592.003-Firmware** - This technique involves modifying firmware, which is not directly related to the described sequence of collecting information and initiating logging activities.
- **B: T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery** - This technique involves discovering objects in cloud storage, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
- **C: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is similar to screen recording but not specifically mentioned in the question.
- **D: T1654-Log Enumeration** - This technique involves enumerating logs, which is more related to the logging activities like screen recording and keylogging rather than the initial information collection phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first collects information and then initiates logging activities.
- The related TTPs mention T1082-System Information Discovery for the initial information collection phase.
- The logging activities like screen recording and keylogging are best aligned with T1056.001-Keylogging.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1082-System Information Discovery (for collecting basic system and Bitcoin wallet information)
2. T1056.001-Keylogging (for initiating logging activities like screen recording and keylogging)

Therefore, the answer choice that best fits the sequence described in the question is:

**Final Answer: C**
