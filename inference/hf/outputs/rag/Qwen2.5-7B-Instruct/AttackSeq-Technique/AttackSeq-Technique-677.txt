### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) are used for privilege escalation.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure that Stuxnet's malicious components are consistently executed upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique is not directly related to ensuring execution at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique is about gaining higher privileges, which is already covered by the initial step of using zero-day vulnerabilities.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique is specifically about ensuring that malicious components are executed at system boot or logon, which aligns with the question's requirement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL:** This technique involves filtering passwords, which is not directly related to ensuring execution at system startup.
   - **B: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique is about implementing multi-factor authentication, which is not relevant to the execution of malicious components at system startup.
   - **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be a method to ensure execution, but it is not as specific to the boot or logon process as T1547.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware, which is not relevant to the execution at system startup.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to ensure Stuxnet's malicious components are consistently executed upon system startup is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: C**
