Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Shamoon malware overwrites the diskâ€™s boot records as part of its defense evasion strategy.
   - The next step in the sequence is to achieve the destruction of target data on disks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe:** This technique involves overwriting the disk's boot records, which aligns with the first part of the sequence described in the question.
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the destruction of data on the target system, which is the next logical step after overwriting the disk's boot records.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562-Impair Defenses** - This technique is about impairing or degrading the effectiveness of defensive measures. While it is related to defense evasion, it does not directly address the destruction of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1485-Data Destruction** - This technique directly addresses the destruction of data on the target system, which is the next logical step after overwriting the disk's boot records.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking** - This technique involves manipulating network traffic to consume bandwidth, which is not relevant to the destruction of data on disks.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification** - This technique involves changing domain policies, which is not directly related to the destruction of data on disks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after overwriting the disk's boot records (T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe), the next step is to destroy the target data (T1485-Data Destruction).

Final Answer: B
