### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan is used to move laterally through the network using manual methods and USB infection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement** - This is relevant as the question involves moving laterally through the network.
   - **Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media** - This is directly related to the use of USB infection, which is mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a foothold. It does not directly relate to the USB infection or manual lateral movement described.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the described lateral movement or USB infection.
   - **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket** - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to gain access to resources. While it is a lateral movement technique, it is more about leveraging existing credentials rather than the initial USB infection or manual lateral movement.
   - **D: T1552.008-Chat Messages** - This technique involves using chat applications to exfiltrate data or communicate with the attacker. It is not directly related to the described lateral movement or USB infection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of USB infection and manual lateral movement, would be a technique that directly follows these actions and is relevant to the network environment. **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media** is the most relevant technique as it directly relates to the USB infection mentioned in the question.
   - However, since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the described actions, and considering the context of lateral movement and the use of USB, the next logical step would be to leverage the credentials or access gained to move further within the network.

   - **Final Answer: C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket** - This technique aligns best with the scenario of moving laterally through the network after gaining initial access via USB infection.
