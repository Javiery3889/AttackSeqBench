Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where information is gathered from a compromised iOS device, and then communication with a C2 server is facilitated using POST and GET requests. The key points are:
- Gathering information (text messages, contact lists, Wi-Fi status)
- Facilitating communication with a C2 server using HTTP methods (POST and GET)

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique involves the attacker using a C2 server to exfiltrate data.
- **Wi-Fi Discovery (T1016.002)**: This technique involves the attacker discovering Wi-Fi networks, which could be relevant if the gathered Wi-Fi status information is used.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It does not directly relate to the communication with a C2 server using HTTP methods.
- **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the attacker using a web service to communicate with the C2 server. This aligns with the use of POST and GET requests, which are HTTP methods.
- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker discovering software on the target system. While it could be part of the initial reconnaissance, it does not directly relate to the communication with a C2 server.
- **D: T1001.001-Junk Data**: This technique involves the attacker sending junk data to overwhelm or confuse the target. It does not align with the use of POST and GET requests for legitimate communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of POST and GET requests to communicate with a C2 server, which aligns with the T1102-Web Service technique.
- The related TTPs mention exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041), which supports the use of a web service for communication.
- The gathered information (text messages, contact lists, Wi-Fi status) is consistent with initial reconnaissance and data exfiltration, which can be facilitated by a web service.

### Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
