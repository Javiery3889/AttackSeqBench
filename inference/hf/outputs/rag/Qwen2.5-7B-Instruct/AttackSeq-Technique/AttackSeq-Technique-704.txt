Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
2. Maintenance of access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a COM object to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell for execution.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding information to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique involves using cloud APIs, which does not align with the described actions of hijacking a COM object or using PowerShell.
- **B: T1505.004-IIS Components**: This technique involves using IIS components, which is not directly related to the described actions of hijacking a COM object or using PowerShell.
- **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs, which is not directly related to the described actions of hijacking a COM object or using PowerShell.
- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting public-facing applications, which is not directly related to the described actions of hijacking a COM object or using PowerShell.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon and Base64 encoded PowerShell commands, which aligns with **T1059.001-PowerShell**.
- The maintenance of access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler aligns with **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**.

Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **T1059.001-PowerShell** (Execution)
- **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** (Persistence)

The answer choice that best fits this sequence is **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**, as it is the closest match to the described actions of using PowerShell and maintaining persistence through COM hijacking.

### Final Answer: C
