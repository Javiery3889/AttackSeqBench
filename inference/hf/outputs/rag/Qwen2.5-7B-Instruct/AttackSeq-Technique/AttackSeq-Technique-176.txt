Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Infamous Chisel achieves persistence by replacing the `netd` system binary and executing it with root privileges. Before this, the question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to run multi-call binary utilities like `dropbear`, `ssh`, and `scp` as root.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1037.004-RC Scripts**: This technique involves using RC scripts to execute commands or scripts with elevated privileges.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**: This technique involves compromising a software binary to achieve persistence.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.002-Systemd Service**: This technique involves using systemd services to escalate privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it does not directly relate to running multi-call binary utilities.
- **B: T1547.014-Active Setup**: This technique involves using Active Setup to run scripts or programs at system startup. It is not directly related to running multi-call binary utilities.
- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves discovering software on the system. It does not directly relate to running multi-call binary utilities.
- **D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves using inter-process communication to execute commands or scripts. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it does not directly relate to running multi-call binary utilities.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
- **T1037.004-RC Scripts**: This technique is directly related to running commands or scripts with elevated privileges, which aligns with the need to run multi-call binary utilities like `dropbear`, `ssh`, and `scp` as root.
- **T1543.002-Systemd Service**: This technique is related to privilege escalation and persistence but does not directly address running multi-call binary utilities.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
