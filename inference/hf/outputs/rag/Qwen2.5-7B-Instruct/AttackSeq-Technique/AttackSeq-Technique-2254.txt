Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where SideCopy, a threat actor, was focusing on harvesting credentials by targeting access to Kavach, an MFA app. Before utilizing modular plugins for keylogging and file enumeration, the question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves persisting malware by adding it to the system's boot process or logon scripts. While it can be part of an attack chain, it does not directly relate to the keylogging or credential harvesting described in the question.

- **B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, which can include keystrokes. Given that the question mentions keylogging, T1056-Input Capture is a strong candidate as it directly aligns with the keylogging activity.

- **C: T1213.001-Confluence**
  - This technique involves using Confluence, a collaborative document management tool, to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the keylogging or credential harvesting described in the question.

- **D: T1115-Clipboard Data**
  - This technique involves stealing data from the clipboard. While it can be part of an attack chain, it does not directly relate to the keylogging or credential harvesting described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions keylogging and credential harvesting.
- The related TTPs include T1056.001-Keylogging, which directly aligns with keylogging.
- Among the answer choices, T1056-Input Capture (B) is the closest match to T1056.001-Keylogging, as both involve capturing user input, which can include keystrokes.

### Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
