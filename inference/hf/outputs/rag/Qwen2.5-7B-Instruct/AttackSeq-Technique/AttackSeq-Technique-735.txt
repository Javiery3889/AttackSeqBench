Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Detailed reconnaissance information is gathered.
2. The next step is achieving persistence without changing the victim's account passwords.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance**
  - **Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: Gathering credentials, which aligns with gathering detailed reconnaissance information.
- **Tactic: Persistence**
  - **Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: Achieving persistence by using local accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
  - This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not directly related to gathering reconnaissance or achieving persistence.
  
- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a method of gathering information, but it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not directly align with the sequence described in the question.
  
- **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase. However, it is not as specific as T1589.001-Credentials, which is more focused on credentials.
  
- **D: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves using local accounts to achieve persistence, which aligns with the final step in the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The question mentions gathering detailed reconnaissance information, such as targets' cyber knowledge and geographic location. The related TTPs mention T1589.001-Credentials, which is a specific technique for gathering credentials, fitting the reconnaissance phase.
2. **Persistence Phase**: The question states that the next step is achieving persistence without changing the victim's account passwords. The related TTPs mention T1078.003-Local Accounts, which is a technique for achieving persistence using local accounts.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Gathering detailed reconnaissance information (T1589.001-Credentials)**
- **Achieving persistence by using local accounts (T1078.003-Local Accounts)**

### Final Answer: D
