### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial technique used by APT10 to compromise targets before deploying malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT.
   - The context is spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the techniques are "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing (C):** This technique involves using malicious links or attachments to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (D):** This is a specific sub-technique of T1566-Phishing that focuses on spear phishing via attachments.
   - **T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie (A):** This technique involves stealing session cookies from web browsers, which is not directly related to spear phishing with attachments or links.
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (B):** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one used for the initial communication, which is not relevant to the initial access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question specifies spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links, the most relevant technique is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is a sub-technique of T1566-Phishing.
   - However, since the question asks for the initial technique used to compromise targets, T1566-Phishing (C) is the broader and more encompassing technique that includes T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.

### Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing
