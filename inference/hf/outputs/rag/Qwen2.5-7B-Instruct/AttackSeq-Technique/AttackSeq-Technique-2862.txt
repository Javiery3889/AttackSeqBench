Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
- Suckfly's Nidiran backdoor communicates with C&C domains.
- It sends encrypted and hardcoded information such as network name and operating system details.
- The next step is to exfiltrate the victim's data off the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration
- Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided information:

- **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. It does not directly relate to exfiltrating data.
  
- **B: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
  - This technique involves using webhooks to exfiltrate data. While it is a method of exfiltration, the question specifically mentions the use of a C2 channel, which is more aligned with T1041.

- **C: T1036.009-Break Process Trees**
  - This technique involves breaking process trees to evade detection. It is not directly related to exfiltrating data.

- **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel to exfiltrate data. Given that the backdoor is communicating with C&C domains and the data is being sent over a C2 channel, this technique aligns perfectly with the scenario described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor (Nidiran) communicates with C&C domains, indicating the use of a C2 channel.
- The data being exfiltrated includes network name and operating system details, which are sent over the C2 channel.
- The related TTP explicitly mentions T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which directly aligns with the described scenario.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
