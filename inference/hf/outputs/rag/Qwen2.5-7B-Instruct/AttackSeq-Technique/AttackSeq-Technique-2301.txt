### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs that occurred before the DNSpionage campaign's detailed discovery commands to retrieve the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information.
   - The DNSpionage campaign is a specific example of an attack that involves detailed reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - The technique "T1033-System Owner/User Discovery" is directly related to the detailed discovery commands to retrieve the infected user's information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique is about using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data, which is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **B: T1001.001-Junk Data** - This technique involves sending junk data to overwhelm or confuse the target, which is not relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which is a method of initial access but not directly related to the detailed discovery commands.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which aligns with the detailed discovery commands to retrieve the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the DNSpionage campaign's detailed discovery commands is **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**.

Final Answer: D
