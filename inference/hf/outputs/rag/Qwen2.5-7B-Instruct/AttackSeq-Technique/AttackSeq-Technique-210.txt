Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
- SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS.
- The communications were encrypted/decrypted with different multi-byte XOR keys.
- The goal is to determine how data was exfiltrated after this communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the same channel (C2) that the attacker uses to communicate with the C&C server for data exfiltration. Given that SparrowDoor used HTTPS for communication, it is plausible that the same channel could be used for exfiltration.
- **T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves using a different protocol for exfiltration that is asymmetrically encrypted and not the same as the C2 channel. However, the question specifies that the communications were encrypted/decrypted with different multi-byte XOR keys, which aligns more closely with the use of the same channel for both communication and exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Communication Channel**: SparrowDoor used HTTPS for communication with the C&C server, which is a secure and encrypted channel.
2. **Examine the Encryption Method**: The communications were encrypted/decrypted with different multi-byte XOR keys, indicating a method of encryption that is consistent with the use of the same channel for both communication and exfiltration.
3. **Match the Technique**: Given the use of the same channel (HTTPS) for both communication and exfiltration, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most plausible technique.

### Final Answer: Final Answer: D
