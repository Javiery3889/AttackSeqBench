### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of techniques used by Gamaredon to evade detection, including:
     - Obfuscated files
     - Modified registry keys
     - Deactivated Microsoft Office security mechanisms

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - T1112-Modify Registry: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to evade detection.
     - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique involves using obfuscated files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1221-Template Injection**
     - This technique involves using templates to inject malicious code. It does not directly relate to the described techniques of modifying registry keys or deactivating security mechanisms.
   - **B: T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures**
     - This technique involves using SQL stored procedures to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the described techniques.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform malicious actions. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly align with the described techniques of modifying registry keys or deactivating security mechanisms.
   - **D: T1218.002-Control Panel**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows Control Panel to hide or modify system settings. This aligns well with the described technique of modifying registry keys, as the Control Panel is often used to manage registry settings.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described techniques of modifying registry keys and deactivating security mechanisms is **T1218.002-Control Panel**.

Final Answer: D
