Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability is exploited for client execution.
2. An unknown technique occurs before establishing persistence.
3. The persistence is achieved by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** and **Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** are mentioned.
- **Tactic: Persistence** and **Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** are also mentioned.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
  - This technique involves using a malicious link to deliver malware. It does not directly relate to exploiting a vulnerability or hijacking COM objects.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. It could be a plausible step after exploiting a vulnerability, but it does not directly relate to hijacking COM objects.
- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. It aligns with the initial exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, but it does not directly relate to hijacking COM objects.
- **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering internet connections. It does not directly relate to exploiting a vulnerability or hijacking COM objects.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Exploiting the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability (initial client execution)**
- **Hijacking COM objects (T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking)**
- **Executing malicious content (persistence)**

The technique that most likely occurred before establishing persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**. This is because it involves executing code, which is a common step in establishing persistence after hijacking COM objects.

### Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
