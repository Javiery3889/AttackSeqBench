Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Social engineering to prompt the target to open a malicious `.src` file.
2. Displaying a decoy document.
3. Executing malware on the victim's machine.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

**A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
- This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

**B: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
- This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

**C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
- This technique involves impairing the victim's defenses, which could be a step after the malware is executed but does not directly follow the execution of the malicious file.

**D: T1566-Phishing**
- This technique involves using social engineering to trick the victim into performing an action, which aligns with the first step in the sequence (social engineering to prompt the target to open a malicious `.src` file).

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the sequence of actions:
1. Social engineering to prompt the target to open a malicious `.src` file.
2. Displaying a decoy document.
3. Executing malware on the victim's machine.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
1. **T1566-Phishing** (social engineering to prompt the target to open a malicious `.src` file)
2. **T1204.002-Malicious File** (executing the malicious file)
3. **T1204-User Execution** (user executing the file, which is a sub-technique of T1204)

However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **after** the use of social engineering to prompt the target to open a malicious `.src` file. The next step in the sequence is the execution of the malicious file.

### Final Answer: D
