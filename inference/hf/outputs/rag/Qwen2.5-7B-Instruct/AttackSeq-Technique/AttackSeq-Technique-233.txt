### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file is used to install the main payload.
   - The goal is to avoid triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up, which is a security feature that requires user interaction to elevate privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Privilege Escalation" and "Defense Evasion" tactics, with a specific technique "T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control."
   - This technique is directly related to evading UAC and is a common method used by malware to execute payloads without user interaction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing credentials or clicking on malicious links. It does not directly relate to bypassing UAC.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique is broader and involves using legitimate mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. While it could be related, it does not specifically mention bypassing UAC.
   - **C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
     - This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load malicious code into the system. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it does not directly address bypassing UAC.
   - **D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**
     - This technique involves purchasing or stealing technical data to gain an advantage. It is not relevant to the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question and the related TTPs is **T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**.

### Final Answer: B
