### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where NodeIISWeb malware is used to maintain persistence.
   - The next step involves avoiding detection by interfering with logging mechanisms and evading commercial EDRs, which is associated with the technique T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription (TG1021).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Tactic: Defense Evasion.
   - T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion: This technique involves using vulnerabilities to evade detection.
   - T1070.004-File Deletion: This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection.
   - T1036.003-Rename System Utilities: This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection**:
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or hide malicious activity. It does not directly relate to avoiding detection by interfering with logging mechanisms or evading EDRs.
   - **B: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**:
     - This technique involves using WMI event subscriptions to execute code in response to certain events. While it can be used for evasion, it is not the most direct precursor to T1546.003.
   - **C: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**:
     - This technique involves adding entries to the Windows autostart locations to ensure persistence. This is a common step after maintaining persistence and before more sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**:
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. It is more about gaining initial access rather than directly evading detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first ensure persistence (NodeIISWeb malware), then use a technique that directly supports maintaining that persistence (T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries), and finally, use T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: C
