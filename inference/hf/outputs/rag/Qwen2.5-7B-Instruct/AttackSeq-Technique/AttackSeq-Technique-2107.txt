### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have already used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection.
   - The next step in the sequence is the collection of detailed information about the victim's computer, such as hostname, OS name and version, and MAC addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery," which aligns with the need to gather information about the victim's environment.
   - The specific technique provided is T1082-System Information Discovery, which directly matches the type of information being collected (hostname, OS name and version, and MAC addresses).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard** - This technique is related to interacting with cloud services, which does not align with the specific information being collected (hostname, OS name, and MAC addresses).
   - **B: T1001.002-Steganography** - This technique involves hiding data within other data, which is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique directly involves gathering information about the system, including the details mentioned in the question (hostname, OS name and version, and MAC addresses).
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not relevant to the collection of system information.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used T1082-System Information Discovery to collect the detailed information about the victim's computer after employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
