### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Elise malware has already employed defense evasion techniques and communicated with a hardcoded C2 server.
   - The next step in the sequence is the harvesting of extensive system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**, **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the C2 channel for data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as system configuration, network topology, and user information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. While it is related to system information discovery, it is more specific to file and directory structures.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network configuration details, which is also part of system information discovery but more focused on network aspects.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique is not directly related to the harvesting of system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is more related to the communication aspect rather than the information harvesting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of harvesting extensive system information, aligns best with **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C
