### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where `libchrome.exe` supports credential access by decrypting stored passwords from Local State and Login Data files.
   - This indicates that the attack involves accessing and decrypting credentials from web browsers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Credential Access" as the tactic and "T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers" as the technique.
   - This confirms that the attack sequence involves extracting credentials from web browsers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves monitoring clipboard contents. While it can be used to capture credentials, it is not directly related to decrypting stored passwords from browser files.
   - **B: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spearphishing email to deliver malware. It is not directly related to decrypting stored passwords from browser files.
   - **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
     - This technique involves archiving data using a custom method. It is not directly related to decrypting stored passwords from browser files.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system-level scheduled tasks or jobs. While it can be used to run malware, it is not directly related to decrypting stored passwords from browser files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the attack sequence involving `libchrome.exe` decrypting stored passwords from Local State and Login Data files, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not directly represented by any of the provided answer choices. However, if we must choose the closest match, **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is the most plausible because it can be used to run the malware that performs the credential access.

### Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
