Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a coin miner is executed, and then TeamTNT's script uses iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details. We need to identify which TTP occurred before the use of iplogger.org for tracking.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection**: T1056.001-Keylogging
- **Discovery**: T1082-System Information Discovery
- **Command and Control**: T1102-Web Service

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**
  - This technique is not listed in the related TTPs and does not directly relate to the context provided.

- **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network connections, which is more about network reconnaissance rather than the specific actions described in the question.

- **C: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves actively scanning networks, which is also more about network reconnaissance and does not directly relate to the specific actions described in the question.

- **D: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering accounts, which could be relevant if the script needed to gather information about the system or network. However, it is not directly related to the use of iplogger.org for tracking.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurred before the use of iplogger.org for tracking the number of infected hosts and obtaining their details is **T1082-System Information Discovery**. This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could include details about the hosts and their status, making it a logical step before using iplogger.org for tracking.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
