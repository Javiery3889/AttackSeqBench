Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) is exploited.
2. Tuyul malware executes Perl scripts and shell commands.
3. The malware operates on the victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces, scripts, and interpreters to execute code.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher levels of access or privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before the execution of Perl scripts and shell commands.

- **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique is directly related to the execution of scripts and commands, which aligns with the description of Tuyul malware executing Perl scripts and shell commands.
  - However, T1059 is more about the execution phase rather than the initial exploitation phase.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a remote server. It does not directly relate to the execution of scripts or commands.

- **Answer Choice C: T1587.004-Exploits**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or control. Given that the question mentions exploiting a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841), this technique is highly relevant to the initial phase of the attack.

- **Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. While it can be used to automate tasks, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial phase of the attack involves exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-9841).
- The next phase involves executing Perl scripts and shell commands, which aligns with T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
- The technique that most plausibly occurred before the execution of these scripts and commands is the exploitation of the vulnerability.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Exploitation of the vulnerability (T1587.004-Exploits)**
- **Execution of Perl scripts and shell commands (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter)**

### Final Answer: C
