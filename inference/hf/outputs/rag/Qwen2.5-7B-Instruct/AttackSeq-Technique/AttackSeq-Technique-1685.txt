### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers sent spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to the victim's systems.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" as the tactic and "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment" as techniques.
   - This confirms that the scenario involves gaining initial access through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1098-Account Manipulation**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating accounts on a system. It is not directly related to the initial access or the execution of a payload from a spear-phishing email.
   - **B: T1059.007-JavaScript**
     - This technique involves the use of JavaScript to execute code. While it could be a method to execute a payload, it is not the most direct or common technique immediately following initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. It is a method to avoid detection but is not directly related to the execution of a payload or the initial access itself.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves convincing a user to execute a file or command, which is a common step after gaining initial access through a spear-phishing email. The user would need to execute the malicious attachment to allow the attackers to gain further access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails is the execution of a file or command by the user. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
