Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Office Macro Scripts are used to load the Chinotto malware. After this initial step, the malware needs to evade detection and load without alerting defenses. We need to identify which technique from the given choices would best fit this scenario.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.009-Break Process Trees**
  - This technique involves breaking the process tree to hide the malware's process or make it appear as part of a legitimate process.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
  - This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code, which is often used in Office documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email. While it could be part of the initial infection vector, it does not directly address evading detection and loading the malware.
- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. While it could be used to execute the malware, it does not specifically address evading detection.
- **Answer Choice C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
  - This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which can help evade disk-based detection mechanisms. This aligns well with the need to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses.
- **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. While it can be used to evade detection, it is more about altering the execution flow rather than loading the malware directly.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware. This suggests that the malware is likely loaded into memory and executed from there.
- The need to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses points towards a technique that can hide the malware's presence in memory.
- Among the given choices, **T1620-Reflective Code Loading** (Answer Choice C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need to load code into memory without writing it to disk, which can help evade detection.

### Final Answer: C
