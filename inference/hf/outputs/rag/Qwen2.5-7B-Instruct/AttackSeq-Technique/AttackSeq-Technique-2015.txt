Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where adversaries used BlackEnergy 3 plugins to conduct credential harvesting and network discovery. The goal was to identify targets within corporate networks and later enumerate all networked devices on the ICS network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the sequence of actions described in the question.

- **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves actively scanning a network to discover hosts and services. While it fits the context of network discovery, it is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.

- **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the network discovery aspect of the question. However, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.

- **C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
  - This technique involves running a virtual instance to execute malicious code or evade detection. It does not directly align with the network discovery or credential harvesting described in the question.

- **D: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
  - This technique involves accessing cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the network discovery or credential harvesting described in the question.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1046-Network Service Discovery** (which is not directly listed in the answer choices but is closely related to network discovery).

However, among the given choices, **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery** is the closest match to the network discovery aspect of the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
