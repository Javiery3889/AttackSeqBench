Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Execution through VBA macros.
2. Writing the 'network.js' file.
3. Modifying the registry.
4. Ensuring NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence** - This is the overarching tactic that the question is focusing on.
- **Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique is specifically about ensuring that malware remains active across system reboots by modifying startup items or autostart locations.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique directly addresses the need to ensure that malware remains active across system reboots. It involves modifying startup items or autostart locations, which aligns with the requirement to keep NanHaiShu active.
  - The related TTPs mention this technique under the Persistence tactic, which fits the context of the question.

- **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking COM objects to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it does not directly address the need to ensure the malware remains active across reboots.

- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is not directly related to ensuring persistence across reboots.

- **D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data to a text storage site, which is not related to ensuring persistence across reboots.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on ensuring that NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots.
- The related TTPs mention T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, which is specifically about ensuring malware remains active across reboots.
- None of the other techniques (B, C, or D) directly address the need for persistence across reboots.

### Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
