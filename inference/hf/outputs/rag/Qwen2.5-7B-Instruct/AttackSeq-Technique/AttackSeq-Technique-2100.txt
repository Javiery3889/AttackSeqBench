### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with initial access through spear-phishing emails with weaponized DOCX documents.
   - The next step in the sequence is the initiation of a multi-stage infection chain leading to the execution of malicious code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - The next step in the sequence should logically be the execution of the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks**
     - This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in a state that allows for the execution of the malicious code. However, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system. Given that the spear-phishing email contained a weaponized DOCX document, it is likely that the next step would be to exploit the vulnerability in the document to execute the malicious code.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication. While this might be a step in the infection chain, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1053.003-Cron**
     - This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule the execution of commands. This is not directly related to the immediate execution of malicious code after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with weaponized DOCX documents is the exploitation of the vulnerability in the document to execute the malicious code.

**Final Answer: B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
