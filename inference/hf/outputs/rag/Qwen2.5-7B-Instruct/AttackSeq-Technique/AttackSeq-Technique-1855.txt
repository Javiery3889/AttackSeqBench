### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving VERMIN malware.
   - The malware has already set up persistence via a scheduled task and obfuscated its code.
   - The next step is to collect system-related details such as machine name, OS name, architecture, and local IP address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Discovery."
   - The specific technique provided is T1082-System Information Discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1069.003-Cloud Groups** - This technique is related to cloud-based services and does not align with the context of collecting system details.
   - **B: T1610-Deploy Container** - This technique is about deploying containers, which is not relevant to the context of collecting system information.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique directly aligns with the action of collecting system-related details such as machine name, OS name, architecture, and local IP address.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique is about capturing user input, which is not relevant to the context of collecting system information.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by the technique T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
