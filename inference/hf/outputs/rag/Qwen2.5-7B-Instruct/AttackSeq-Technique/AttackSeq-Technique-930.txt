Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Keylogging capabilities are used to gain administrator passwords.
2. The attackers then use writable mass storage devices (USBs) to spread across the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (used for spreading across the network via USBs)
- T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (initial access via removable media)
- T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB (exfiltration technique)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before the attackers utilized writable mass storage devices for USB infection to spread across the network.

- **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an SSH session, which is not directly related to the use of USBs for spreading malware.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is also not directly related to the use of USBs for spreading malware.
- **C: T1216.001-PubPrn**: This technique involves using public printers for malicious purposes, which is not directly related to the use of USBs for spreading malware.
- **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access, which could be a method to initially gain access to the network before using USBs to spread malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions keylogging to gain administrator passwords, which is a method of initial access.
- The related TTPs include T1091-Replication Through Removable Media, which is directly related to the use of USBs for spreading malware.
- T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is a common method for initial access, which aligns with the keylogging technique mentioned in the question.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first exploited remote services to gain initial access, then used writable mass storage devices (USBs) to spread across the network.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
