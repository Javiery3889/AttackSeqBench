Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor is used to inject additional modules into device memory, and then the infected devices connect to C2 servers to remain part of the botnet. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the infected devices connected to C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's systems.
- **Replication Through Removable Media (T1091):** This technique involves the adversary using removable media to spread malware.
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary controlling the infected systems.
- **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105):** This technique involves the adversary transferring tools to the target system to maintain persistence or control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This technique involves renaming system utilities to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
- **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a program to execute malicious code. It is more about altering the execution flow rather than the initial access or C2 connection.
- **C: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting file permissions to execute malicious code. It is also more about altering the execution flow and does not directly relate to the initial access or C2 connection.
- **D: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to spread malware. It is more about the spread of malware rather than the initial access or C2 connection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where a backdoor is used to inject additional modules into device memory, and then the infected devices connect to C2 servers. This implies that the initial access and the method of spreading or maintaining persistence are crucial.
- The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Ingress Tool Transfer," which are directly related to gaining access to the system and transferring tools, respectively.
- Among the given answer choices, none directly match the "Initial Access" or "Ingress Tool Transfer" techniques. However, the closest match in terms of spreading or maintaining persistence is "Shared Modules" (T1129), which can be used to spread malware or maintain persistence.

### Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
