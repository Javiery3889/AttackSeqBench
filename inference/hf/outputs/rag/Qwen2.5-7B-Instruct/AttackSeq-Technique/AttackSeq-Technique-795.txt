### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the wiper module used RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system under the Impact tactic.
   - The Impact tactic involves actions that cause harm to the victim's systems, such as data destruction.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the destruction of data on a system, which aligns with the wiper module's actions.
   - **T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe:** This technique involves wiping the disk structure, which includes overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files, similar to the actions described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to make it unreadable, which does not align with the described actions of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files.
   - **B: T1561-Disk Wipe:** This technique involves wiping the disk, which is similar to the actions described but is broader than T1561.002.
   - **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect network traffic, which is not related to the described actions.
   - **D: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood:** This technique involves flooding a service to make it unavailable, which is not related to the described actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe, as it directly aligns with the actions of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files.
   - T1485-Data Destruction is also relevant but does not specifically mention the MBR and partitions, making T1561.002 more precise.

**Final Answer: B: T1561-Disk Wipe**
