### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where ShadowPad is executed by decrypting an encrypted payload in a DLL loader and launching a legitimate executable as a Windows service.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique ensures ShadowPad remains active after system restarts or interruptions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence** - This is relevant as it pertains to ensuring the malware remains active.
   - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which aligns with the described execution method.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is relevant for techniques that help the malware evade detection.
   - **Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads** - This involves embedding malicious code within legitimate files, which is part of the initial execution method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring the malware runs when the system boots or when a user logs on. This is a strong candidate for ensuring persistence.
   - **B: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription** - This technique involves using WMI to create event subscriptions that can trigger actions. While this can be used for persistence, it is not as directly related to ensuring the malware remains active after a system restart or service interruption.
   - **C: T1098.003-Additional Cloud Roles** - This is not relevant to the context of the question.
   - **D: T1569-System Services** - This involves creating or modifying system services to ensure the malware runs as a service. This is also a strong candidate for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both T1547 and T1569 are strong candidates for ensuring persistence. However, T1569 specifically involves creating or modifying system services, which aligns closely with the described action of launching the legitimate executable as a Windows service.
   - T1547, while also related to persistence, is more about boot or logon autostart, which is a broader category and not as specific to the service-based persistence as T1569.

### Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services
