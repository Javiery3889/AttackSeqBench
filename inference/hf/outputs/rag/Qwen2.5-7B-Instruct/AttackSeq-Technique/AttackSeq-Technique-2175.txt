Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: reconnaissance using spear phishing emails to evaluate software installed on a victim's computer through GET requests to third-party websites.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to gain access to the victim's device.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" as the tactic and "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link" as techniques.
   - T1566-Phishing is a broader technique that includes various forms of phishing.
   - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is a specific sub-technique of T1566-Phishing that involves sending a malicious link via email.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This technique is related to credential access and does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **Option B: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves collecting information from the victim through phishing, but it is not specifically about gaining access to the device.
   - **Option C: T1566-Phishing** - This is a broader technique that includes various forms of phishing, which aligns with the described sequence of actions.
   - **Option D: T1123-Audio Capture** - This technique involves capturing audio from the victim's device, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1566-Phishing, as it aligns with the use of spear phishing emails to gain initial access to the victim's device.
   
   Final Answer: C
