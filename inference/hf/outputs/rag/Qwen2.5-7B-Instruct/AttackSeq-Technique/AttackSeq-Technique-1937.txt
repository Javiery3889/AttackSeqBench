### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Smooth Operator malware ensured persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this persistence mechanism.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves using a component of a server software package to maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and trust providers to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1176-Browser Extensions** - This technique involves using browser extensions to maintain persistence. However, the question specifies that the persistence was achieved through a legitimate component of the 3CX software package, not a browser extension.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1505-Server Software Component** - This technique aligns with the description in the question, as it involves using a component of a server software package (3CX) to maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087-Account Discovery** - This technique involves discovering valid accounts to gain access or move laterally. It does not directly relate to the persistence mechanism described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites** - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites. It is not directly related to the persistence mechanism described.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the persistence was achieved using a legitimate component of the 3CX software package, which aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1505-Server Software Component.

**Final Answer: B: T1505-Server Software Component**
