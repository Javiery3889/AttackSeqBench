### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the WinDealer malware, including executing the malware, configuring it by reading a configuration file, and loading a DLL module.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware discovered information about the infected PC and network configuration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering information about the system and network configuration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves the malware loading a DLL module, which aligns with the question's mention of loading a DLL module.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering files and directories, which could be part of the initial configuration file reading.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique is not directly related to the malware's actions described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is about evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which is not directly related to the malware's actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves the malware disguising itself to blend in with legitimate software, which is not directly related to the malware's actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering software on the system, which could be part of the initial configuration file reading and subsequent actions.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that the malware discovered information about the infected PC and network configuration after performing software discovery. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1518-Software Discovery**
