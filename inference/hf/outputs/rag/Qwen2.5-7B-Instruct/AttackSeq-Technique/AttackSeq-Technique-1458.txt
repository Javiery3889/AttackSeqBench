### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tildeb (a known malware) sets up a secure channel with its C&C server over TCP and establishes encrypted communication.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the execution through the exploitation of compiled Windows executable code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-standard or non-application layer protocols for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique is about using standard application layer protocols for C&C communication, which does not align with the question's requirement of exploiting compiled Windows executable code.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native Windows APIs to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible choice as it involves exploiting compiled code.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique is about using hybrid identities to evade detection, which does not align with the question's requirement of exploiting compiled Windows executable code.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code, which does not align with the question's requirement of exploiting compiled Windows executable code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's requirement of exploiting compiled Windows executable code is **T1106-Native API**.

**Final Answer: B**
