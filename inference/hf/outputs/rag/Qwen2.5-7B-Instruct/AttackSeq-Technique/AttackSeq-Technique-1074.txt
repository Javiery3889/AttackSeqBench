Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial deployment of malware via an Internet Explorer exploit.
2. Deployment of a PowerShell loader.
3. Targeting system-level privileges with an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Privilege Escalation**: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
- **Execution**: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which TTPs align with the sequence described in the question.

- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is relevant to the initial deployment of malware via an Internet Explorer exploit.
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is relevant to the deployment of a PowerShell loader.
- **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique is relevant to the targeting of system-level privileges with an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)**: This is the first step where the attacker uses an Internet Explorer exploit to gain initial access to the system.
2. **Execution (T1059.001-PowerShell)**: After gaining initial access, the attacker uses PowerShell to deploy a loader.
3. **Privilege Escalation (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation)**: Finally, the attacker exploits CVE-2019-1458 to escalate privileges to system level.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)
- Execution (T1059.001-PowerShell)
- Privilege Escalation (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation)

Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (Note: This is a mislabel in the provided choices, but the correct sequence aligns with T1190, T1059.001, and T1068 as described in the question and related TTPs.)
