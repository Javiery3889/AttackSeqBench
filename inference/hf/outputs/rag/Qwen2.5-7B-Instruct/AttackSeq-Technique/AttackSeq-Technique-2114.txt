### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors first acquire servers (through compromise or legitimate purchase) and then use these servers to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control (C2) purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Tactic of "Resource Development" and involve techniques related to acquiring and configuring servers:
     - T1583.004-Server: Acquire or compromise a server.
     - T1584.004-Server: Acquire or compromise a server.
     - T1608.002-Upload Tool: Upload a tool to a server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email, which is not directly related to acquiring or configuring servers for C2 purposes.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities** - This technique involves obtaining the ability to perform actions, but it does not specifically address the acquisition and configuration of servers.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique involves using external remote services, which could be part of the C2 infrastructure but does not directly address the acquisition and configuration of servers.
   - **D: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups** - This technique involves creating additional local or domain groups, which is not directly related to the acquisition and configuration of servers for C2 purposes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the acquisition and configuration of servers. The related TTPs T1583.004-Server and T1584.004-Server directly address the acquisition and configuration of servers, which aligns with the question's description.
   - **Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services** is not the best fit, but the closest related TTPs are T1583.004-Server and T1584.004-Server. However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence and the closest related TTPs are not listed, the best answer among the choices provided is C, as it is the closest to the context of server configuration.

   **Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services** (though it is not the best fit, it is the closest among the provided choices).
