### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where BlackSoul has established communication with a C2 server using a RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to transfer data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration** - This is relevant as the question is about transferring data.
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** - This technique specifically deals with exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control** - This is relevant as it involves communication with a C2 server.
   - **Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using a non-application layer protocol for C2 communication, which aligns with the use of RESTful Strapi protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket** - This technique is related to Kerberos authentication and is not directly related to data exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** - This technique involves exfiltration over a non-C2 protocol, which does not align with the C2 channel described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This technique involves automated exfiltration of data, but it does not specify the protocol or channel used.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1560-Archive Collected Data** - This technique involves archiving data for later exfiltration, but it does not specify the protocol or channel used.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**, as it directly addresses the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel using a non-application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: B**
