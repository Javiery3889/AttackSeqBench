Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Luckycat campaign:
1. Leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence.
2. Communicating with its C&C infrastructure.
3. Using diverse email addresses to register domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves the use of email accounts to register domains.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**: This technique involves using WMI for persistence.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**: This technique involves using WMI for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the technique that best fits the communication step after persistence and before domain registration.

- **A: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for communication, which is not directly related to the WMI persistence technique.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is also not directly related to WMI persistence.
- **C: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves enumerating logs, which is not related to communication.
- **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not related to communication.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Persistence**: The campaign uses WMI for persistence (T1546.003).
2. **Communication**: After persistence, the campaign needs to communicate with its C&C infrastructure. The related TTPs do not directly mention a specific communication technique, but we can infer that the communication would likely use a protocol or application layer protocol.
3. **Domain Registration**: The campaign uses diverse email addresses to register domains (T1585.002).

Given the context, the most plausible technique for communication after persistence and before domain registration would be an application layer protocol, which is closely related to the use of WMI for persistence.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
