### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving spearphishing with malicious `.lnk` files and the use of the double extension trick for defense evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems after the initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension:** This technique is relevant to the use of the double extension trick for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique is relevant to the initial access via spearphishing with malicious `.lnk` files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. While it is a plausible method for communication, it does not directly relate to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves using non-standard encoding to evade detection. While it can be used for communication, it is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1010-Application Window Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering and interacting with application windows. It is not directly related to the communication aspect of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it is related to the initial access phase, it does not address the communication aspect after initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks about the communication method after initial access, which is facilitated by a technique that aligns with the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most plausible choice as it directly relates to the communication aspect after initial access, which is the focus of the question.

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
