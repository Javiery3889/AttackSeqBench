### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Reflective Loader with anti-analysis techniques is used for covert DLL injection.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next to maintain persistence on the victim system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence** - This is relevant as maintaining persistence is a key objective.
   - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which aligns with the use of a Reflective Loader and DLL injection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This is relevant as the Reflective Loader and anti-analysis techniques are used to evade detection.
   - **Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection** - This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process, which is consistent with the scenario described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves creating or modifying files in specific directories to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon. While this can be a method of persistence, it does not directly follow the use of a Reflective Loader and DLL injection.
   - **B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to credentials. It does not directly follow the use of a Reflective Loader and DLL injection.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation** - This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection. While this can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the use of a Reflective Loader and DLL injection.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account** - This technique involves creating new user accounts to maintain access. It does not directly follow the use of a Reflective Loader and DLL injection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of a Reflective Loader and DLL injection, is to maintain persistence by ensuring the malware runs continuously. The technique that best fits this scenario is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, as it directly addresses the need to ensure the malware remains active on the system.

**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
