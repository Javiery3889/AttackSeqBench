### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker uses WMI to check for installed antivirus software and avoids PowerShell execution during defense evasion.
   - The final step is to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying security software on the target system, which aligns with the use of WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**
     - This technique involves exploiting the target's defenses to avoid detection or disruption, which aligns with avoiding PowerShell execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the attacker's network traffic. It does not directly relate to sending information to a C2 server using a specific protocol or method.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which is related to the initial discovery phase but does not specifically address sending information to a C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with a C2 server. Webserv-redir.net is a type of application layer protocol, making this a strong candidate.
   - **D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves using multiple identities to blend in with legitimate users or systems. It does not directly relate to sending information to a C2 server.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the use of an application layer protocol to send information to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
