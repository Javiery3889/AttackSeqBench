Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spear-phishing campaigns involving RAR-compressed executables or Word attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to install NetTraveler.
2. The actor's ability to direct communications to their C&C infrastructure mimicking news and military sites.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via spear-phishing.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via spear-phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to IP addresses. While it could be used to evade detection, it does not directly facilitate directing communications to a C&C infrastructure.
- **B: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media to exfiltrate or install malware. It does not align with the described attack sequence.
- **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it is part of the initial access phase, it does not directly address the communication to the C&C infrastructure.
- **D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates to gain unauthorized access. While it could be used to establish a secure channel, it does not directly address the communication to the C&C infrastructure mimicking news and military sites.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the actor installs NetTraveler and then directs communications to a C&C infrastructure mimicking news and military sites.
- The related TTPs indicate that the initial access is achieved through spear-phishing (both links and attachments).
- The technique that best fits the description of directing communications to a C&C infrastructure is **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**, as it involves dynamically resolving domain names, which could be used to direct traffic to a mimicked C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
