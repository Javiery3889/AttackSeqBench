Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a dropper (Babar) uses global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications for logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection**
- **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** (Keystroke logging)
- **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture** (Screen capture)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
  - This technique involves communication between processes, which is not directly related to the logging of keystrokes or capturing screenshots. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.

- **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)**
  - This technique involves using SNMP to dump Management Information Base (MIB) data. It is not related to keystroke logging or screen capture, so it does not fit the sequence.

- **C: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the description of logging keystrokes (T1056.001-Keylogging). However, T1056 is a broader category that includes T1056.001-Keylogging, so it is a more general choice.

- **D: T1583.001-Domains**
  - This technique involves using domains for command and control (C2) communications. It is not directly related to the logging of keystrokes or capturing screenshots, so it does not fit the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial phase of logging keystrokes (T1056.001-Keylogging) and capturing screenshots (T1113-Screen Capture).
- The related TTPs confirm that these are part of the Collection tactic.
- Among the answer choices, T1056-Input Capture (C) is the most specific and relevant technique that aligns with the described logging of keystrokes and capturing of screenshots.

### Final Answer: C: T1056-Input Capture
