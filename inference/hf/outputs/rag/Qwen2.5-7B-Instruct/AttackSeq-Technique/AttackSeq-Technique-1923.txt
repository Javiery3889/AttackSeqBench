Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10:
1. Dynamic-DNS domains for command and control.
2. Robocopy and PSCP for secure data transfer.
3. An unknown technique to enable data exfiltration from the victim network to the C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the same channels that are used for command and control to exfiltrate data. Given that APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for command and control, it is logical that they would use the same channels for data exfiltration.
- **T1602.002-Network Device Configuration Dump**: This technique involves dumping network device configurations, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
- **T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the use of dynamic-DNS domains for C2.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for command and control and employs tools like Robocopy and PSCP for secure data transfer.
- The related TTPs mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which aligns with the use of the same channels for both command and control and data exfiltration.
- The other techniques do not fit the context of the question.

### Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
