Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware rewrites itself in the %Temp% folder and uses polymorphic techniques to evade detection. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware employed methods like HEX obfuscation to remain undetected.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**: This technique involves the malware changing its code to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves the malware encoding or encrypting its code to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1070.006-Timestomp**
  - This technique involves modifying the file timestamps to evade detection. While it is a form of defense evasion, it does not directly relate to the obfuscation or polymorphism described in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions that are less likely to be detected by security software. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation or polymorphism described in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves encoding or encrypting the malware to avoid detection. It is closely related to the HEX obfuscation mentioned in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1197-BITS Jobs**
  - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation or polymorphism described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first rewrites itself in the %Temp% folder and then uses polymorphic techniques to evade detection. The next step is the use of HEX obfuscation to remain undetected.
- The related TTPs mention T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information, which is directly related to the use of obfuscation techniques like HEX obfuscation.
- T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is the most relevant technique as it directly aligns with the use of HEX obfuscation to remain undetected.

However, the question asks which technique most likely occurred before the malware employed methods like HEX obfuscation. Given the context, the technique that would most likely occur before HEX obfuscation is T1027.014-Polymorphic Code, as polymorphic code is a precursor to obfuscation techniques like HEX obfuscation.

### Final Answer: C
