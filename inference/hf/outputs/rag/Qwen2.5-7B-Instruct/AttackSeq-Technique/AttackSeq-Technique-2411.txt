### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker periodically checks web pages for one-way messages containing the C2 node address. This indicates a form of communication and data transfer to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
       - This technique involves the attacker using one-way communication to maintain control over the compromised system. This aligns with the periodic checking of web pages for C2 node addresses.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
       - This technique involves the attacker using a C2 channel to exfiltrate data from the compromised system. This is directly related to the data transfer to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique directly involves the transfer of data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1098-Account Manipulation**
     - This technique involves modifying user accounts, which is not directly related to the data transfer described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is not directly related to the data transfer described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository, which is not directly related to the C2 channel described.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
