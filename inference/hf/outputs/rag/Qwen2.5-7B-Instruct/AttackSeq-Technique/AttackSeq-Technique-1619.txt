### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT28 ensures persistence by altering the timestamps of files downloaded by the second stage dropper to conceal them from victims.
   - The key technique mentioned is "T1070.006-Timestomp," which is a sub-technique of T1070 (Indicator Removal from Systems).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs list "T1070.006-Timestomp" as a sub-technique under the Tactic: Defense Evasion. This confirms that the question is focused on techniques used to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to exfiltrate data or communicate with command and control servers. It does not directly relate to altering file timestamps.
   - **B: T1218.013-Mavinject**
     - This technique involves the use of MAPI (Message Application Programming Interface) to inject code into email messages. It is not related to altering file timestamps.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from systems. T1070.006-Timestomp is a sub-technique of T1070 that specifically alters file timestamps to remove indicators.
   - **D: T1546.017-Udev Rules**
     - This technique involves the use of udev rules to create or modify device nodes. It is not related to altering file timestamps.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the use of T1070.006-Timestomp to alter file timestamps for concealment.

**Final Answer: C**
