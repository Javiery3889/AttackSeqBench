### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first send spear phishing emails containing compressed executables or phishing links targeting senior executives to gather initial information.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" as the tactic and specifically list "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link" as techniques.
   - This confirms that the initial phase involves phishing, specifically spear phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1592.003-Firmware** - This technique involves the use of firmware to deliver malware. It is not directly related to the initial spear phishing attack described.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the initial spear phishing attack described.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using phishing to gather information. Given the context of the question, this technique aligns well with the initial spear phishing attack described.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking** - This technique involves the use of resource forks to hide or obfuscate files. It is not directly related to the initial spear phishing attack described.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial spear phishing attack is the technique used to gather information from the targets. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information
