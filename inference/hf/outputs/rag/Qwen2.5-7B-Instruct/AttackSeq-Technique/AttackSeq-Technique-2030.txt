Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Duke group uses Seaduke to retrieve system information and perform updates.
2. The group then securely communicates with the C2 server over HTTP/HTTPS to control Seaduke operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets, which is not directly related to the use of HTTP/HTTPS for communication.
  - It does not align with the described communication method.

- **B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique involves using mail protocols for command and control. However, the question specifically mentions HTTP/HTTPS, not mail protocols.
  - This does not align with the described communication method.

- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels for command and control. HTTP/HTTPS is an encrypted protocol (HTTPS), which aligns with this technique.
  - This aligns well with the described communication method.

- **D: T1505.002-Transport Agent**
  - This technique involves using a transport agent for command and control. It is not directly related to the use of HTTP/HTTPS for communication.
  - This does not align with the described communication method.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of HTTP/HTTPS for secure communication with the C2 server.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a subset of T1071 (Web Protocols).
- T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant technique as it directly involves the use of encrypted channels, which aligns with the use of HTTPS for secure communication.

### Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
