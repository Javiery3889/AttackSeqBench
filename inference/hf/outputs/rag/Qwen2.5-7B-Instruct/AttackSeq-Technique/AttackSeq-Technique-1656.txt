Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to compromised websites, and malware is delivered via scripts or HTML smuggling techniques. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this redirection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to victims who visit the site.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique involves using HTML to smuggle data or malware.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This technique involves targeting a website to make it a vector for delivering malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to a text storage site, which is not directly related to the delivery of malware via compromised websites.
- **Option B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or messages to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly fit the scenario of being redirected to a compromised website.
- **Option C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the identity of system owners or users, which is not directly related to the delivery of malware via compromised websites.
- **Option D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link to a specific individual or group. While it can be part of an initial access technique, it does not directly fit the scenario of being redirected to a compromised website.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes victims being redirected to compromised websites where malware is delivered via HTML smuggling techniques. This aligns with the T1189-Drive-by Compromise technique, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
- The malware delivery via HTML smuggling is directly related to the T1027.006-HTML Smuggling technique, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the redirection, which is the malware delivery via the compromised website.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the malware delivery via the compromised website, which is best represented by the T1189-Drive-by Compromise technique.

### Final Answer: T1189-Drive-by Compromise (not directly listed in the answer choices, but the closest match is T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which is a part of the initial access and could be a precursor to the drive-by compromise)

Since the exact T1189-Drive-by Compromise is not listed in the answer choices, the closest match would be:

Final Answer: D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
