### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Poison Ivy server process is maintained using a watchdog thread in explorer.exe.
   - The next step in the sequence is to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention Command and Control (C2) tactics and techniques.
   - Specifically, T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol are relevant.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**
     - This technique is not directly related to securing communication or using a custom network protocol.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to using a custom network protocol over TCP.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code based on an event, which is not directly related to securing communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to secure communication. Given that the question mentions a custom network protocol over TCP, this technique aligns well with the need to secure the communication channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to use T1573-Encrypted Channel to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

**Final Answer: D**
