Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Grandoreiro steals credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
2. The malware communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP to check for commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
- **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding or obfuscating the malware or its artifacts. It does not directly relate to stealing credentials or communicating with a C&C server.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. While it can be a method to steal credentials, it is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**
  - This technique involves monitoring user activity to identify potential security threats. It does not directly relate to stealing credentials or communicating with a C&C server.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as system configuration, network topology, and user accounts. While it can be a precursor to stealing credentials, it is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly involves stealing credentials from web browsers and then communicating with a C&C server. The technique T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers is the most relevant to the question.

**Final Answer: B**
