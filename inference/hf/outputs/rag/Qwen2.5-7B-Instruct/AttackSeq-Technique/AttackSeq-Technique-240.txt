Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malware has established persistence through a hidden 'autoupdater' module. The goal is to remain undetected while using a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic. This implies the need for techniques that can help the malware blend in and avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**
  - This technique involves making the malware appear as a legitimate application or process, which aligns with the need to use a legitimate-looking application.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**
  - This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to hide C2 traffic, which aligns with the need for encrypted network traffic.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**
  - This is a general technique related to the development of malware, which is not directly relevant to the specific TTPs needed for evasion and C2.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1657-Financial Theft**
  - This technique is not directly related to the described scenario of blending in and avoiding detection.
- **Answer Choice B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
  - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process, which can help in hiding the malicious activity. However, it does not directly address the need for a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.
- **Answer Choice C: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
  - This technique is not relevant to the described scenario.
- **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand, which can help in avoiding detection. However, it does not directly address the need for a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** helps in making the malware appear as a legitimate application, which aligns with the need for a legitimate-looking application.
- **T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation** helps in hiding C2 traffic by using legitimate protocols or services, which aligns with the need for encrypted network traffic.

Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described scenario is a combination of making the malware appear legitimate and hiding C2 traffic.

**Final Answer: B (T1055.012-Process Hollowing) and C (T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation)**

However, since the question asks for a single answer choice, the most relevant and directly applicable TTP from the given choices is:

**Final Answer: B (T1055.012-Process Hollowing)**
