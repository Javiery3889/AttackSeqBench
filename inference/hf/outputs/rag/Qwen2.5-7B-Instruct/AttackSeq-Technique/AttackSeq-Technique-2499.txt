### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Black Energy 2 used HTTP requests for communication with the C&C server.
   - The goal is to identify a technique that would enable the use of HTTP requests and the receipt of encrypted configuration files and commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Command and Control" and "Web Protocols" (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
   - T1071.001-Web Protocols specifically refers to the use of web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of HTTP requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves disrupting network services, which does not directly enable the use of HTTP requests for communication.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This is a broader category that includes T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is directly related to the use of web protocols for command and control.
   - **C: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
     - This technique involves modifying network traffic at the socket level, which is not directly related to enabling HTTP requests for command and control.
   - **D: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
     - This technique involves setting up access rules based on conditions, which is not directly related to enabling HTTP requests for command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that would enable Black Energy 2 to use HTTP requests for communication with the C&C server is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
