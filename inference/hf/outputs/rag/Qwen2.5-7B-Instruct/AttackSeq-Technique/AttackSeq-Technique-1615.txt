### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Lazarus gained access to other devices within the FEIB network using hardcoded credentials and established connections to SMB shares.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Lateral Movement," which involves moving from one system to another within a network.
   - The technique mentioned is "T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares," which involves using administrative shares to gain access to network resources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or data laterally within a network. Given that the initial access was through hardcoded credentials and SMB shares, it is plausible that the next step would be to transfer tools or data to other systems.
   - **B: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking a remote service session. While this could be a method of lateral movement, it is not directly related to the initial access through hardcoded credentials and SMB shares.
   - **C: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
     - This technique involves executing commands on a system through an intermediary. It is a method of gaining or maintaining access but does not directly relate to the lateral movement aspect described.
   - **D: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves authenticating to a domain controller. While this could be a method of gaining higher privileges, it is not directly related to the lateral movement aspect described.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining access through hardcoded credentials and establishing connections to SMB shares would be to transfer tools or data to other systems within the network.

**Final Answer: A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
