### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Sednit group used stolen credentials for network scanning and collection of system information during the information-gathering phase.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a target system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves the use of stolen credentials for reconnaissance purposes.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to steal credentials or other sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1074-Data Staged**
     - This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration, which typically occurs after data has been collected and possibly processed. However, the question does not mention data preparation, so this is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic, which is already mentioned in the question. It is unlikely to occur after the initial data collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials, which is already mentioned in the question. It is unlikely to occur after the initial data collection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on a system, which is a common step in the information-gathering phase. However, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence would be the exfiltration of the collected data. The related TTPs mention exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) as a subsequent step after reconnaissance and credential access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1074-Data Staged
