Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. BlackSoul collects specified files from the victim's machine.
2. BlackSoul updates its configuration file.
3. BlackSoul exfiltrates data over the C2 channel using automated methods.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the attacker using automated methods to exfiltrate data.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves the attacker exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before the exfiltration over the C2 channel using automated methods.

- **Option A: T1037.002-Login Hook**: This technique involves creating a login hook to execute malicious code when a user logs in. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration process.
- **Option B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**: This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
- **Option C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. It could be a step before exfiltration, but it is not specifically related to the exfiltration process.
- **Option D: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. It could be a step before exfiltration, but it is not specifically related to the exfiltration process.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlackSoul performed some form of data preparation or obfuscation before exfiltrating the data over the C2 channel using automated methods. However, none of the provided options directly align with the exfiltration process as described.

Since the question asks which TTP most likely occurred before the exfiltration over the C2 channel using automated methods, and considering the related TTPs, the closest match would be a technique that prepares or obfuscates the data before exfiltration. Among the given options, **T1132-Data Encoding** (Option D) is the most relevant as it involves encoding data, which could be a preparatory step before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
