### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where ShadowPad uses DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application to execute a backdoor.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred for the attackers to gain access to the victim's network before executing the backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **Privilege Escalation (Tactic) and DLL Side-Loading (Technique)**
     - **Defense Evasion (Tactic) and DLL Side-Loading (Technique)**
     - **Persistence (Tactic) and Component Object Model (COM) Hijacking (Technique)**
   - These TTPs suggest that the attackers are using DLL side-loading and COM hijacking to gain persistence and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique is about using encrypted channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. While it could be used after gaining access, it does not directly relate to the initial access method.
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing to gain initial access. Given the context of ShadowPad, which is known for using sophisticated methods, this could be a plausible initial access method.
   - **C: T1187-Forced Authentication**
     - This technique involves forcing users to authenticate in a way that allows the attacker to gain access. It is more about manipulating authentication processes rather than gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain access. Given the context of using a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application, this could be a plausible initial access method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Considering the context of using a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application, the most plausible initial access method would be exploiting a vulnerability in the application to gain access.
   - Therefore, the best answer choice is **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

### Final Answer: D
