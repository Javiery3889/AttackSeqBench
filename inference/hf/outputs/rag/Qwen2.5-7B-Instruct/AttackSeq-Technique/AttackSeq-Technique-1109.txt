Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. The attacker exploited an Exchange Server via ProxyLogon.
2. The attacker uploaded a webshell for high-privilege code execution.
3. The attacker then created a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image' for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique is relevant to the initial exploitation of the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique is directly related to creating a Windows system service for persistence.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique is also related to creating a Windows system service, but it is more focused on the privilege escalation aspect.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interpreters or scripting languages to execute commands. While it can be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of creating a Windows service for persistence.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other actions. It is not directly related to the sequence of creating a Windows service for persistence.
- **C: T1505.002-Transport Agent**: This technique involves using transport agents to move data. It is not directly related to the sequence of creating a Windows service for persistence.
- **D: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct or relevant technique for creating a Windows service.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence involves exploiting an Exchange Server, gaining high-privilege code execution, and then creating a Windows service for persistence.
- The most relevant technique for creating a Windows service for persistence is **T1543.003-Windows Service**.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is directly related to creating a Windows service for persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
