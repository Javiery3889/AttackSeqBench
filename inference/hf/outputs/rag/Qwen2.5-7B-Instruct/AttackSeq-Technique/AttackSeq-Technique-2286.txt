### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Regin utilized its remote access Trojan features for collecting data, such as screen capture.
   - The key point here is the sequence of events: a technique that precedes the use of Regin's screen capture feature.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Collection" and the technique "T1113-Screen Capture."
   - T1113-Screen Capture is the technique that Regin uses to collect data, specifically screen captures.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture** - This is the technique that Regin uses for screen capture, so it cannot be the technique that occurred before Regin's use of this feature.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories** - This technique involves gathering data from various information repositories. While it is a collection technique, it is not specifically related to screen capture.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules, which can be used for various purposes, but it is not directly related to screen capture.
   - **D: T1610-Deploy Container** - This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically related to screen capture.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that Regin uses T1113-Screen Capture for data collection, the technique that most likely occurred before this would be a technique that is part of the collection tactic and is more general in nature, such as gathering data from various sources.
   - Among the choices, T1213-Data from Information Repositories is the most plausible as it is a collection technique that can precede the specific screen capture technique.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
