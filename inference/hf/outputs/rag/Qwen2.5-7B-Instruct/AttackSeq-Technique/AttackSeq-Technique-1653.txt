### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability is exploited to gain initial access to a victim network.
   - The next step in the sequence is the group locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to a network.
   - **Persistence:**
     - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access to the network.
     - **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity:** This technique involves using a combination of legitimate and illegitimate identities to maintain access.
     - **T1590.002-DNS:** This technique involves manipulating DNS records to maintain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique is about gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to persistence.
   - **Option B: T1136-Create Account**
     - This technique involves creating new accounts, which could be a step towards persistence but is not as directly related to the context of using valid accounts or hybrid identities.
   - **Option C: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves using a combination of legitimate and illegitimate identities, which aligns well with the idea of securing alternative means of persistence.
   - **Option D: T1590.002-DNS**
     - This technique involves manipulating DNS records, which is a method of persistence but is more specific to DNS manipulation rather than a general method of securing alternative means of persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**.

**Final Answer: C: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
