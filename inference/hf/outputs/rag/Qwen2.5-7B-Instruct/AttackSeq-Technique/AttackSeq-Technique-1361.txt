Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. CVE-2015-5119 is exploited to save and execute `%Temp%/Rdws.exe`.
2. `%Temp%/Rdws.exe` retrieves a second-stage PlugX file.
3. The second-stage PlugX file communicates with a C2 domain (inocnation[.]com).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique is relevant to the initial exploitation of CVE-2015-5119.
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is also relevant as it might be used to execute `%Temp%/Rdws.exe`.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique is relevant to the transfer of the second-stage PlugX file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique facilitated the communication with the C2 domain (inocnation[.]com).

- **A: T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. It is not typically used for communication with C2 domains.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers. This is a plausible method for communication.
- **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. It is not directly related to the communication with a C2 domain.
- **D: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system. It is not related to communication with a C2 domain.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the communication with the C2 domain (inocnation[.]com).
- The related TTPs do not directly mention communication techniques, but T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a standard method for such communication.
- None of the other techniques (Steganography, Drive-by Compromise, or Data from Local System) are directly related to the communication aspect of the attack.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
