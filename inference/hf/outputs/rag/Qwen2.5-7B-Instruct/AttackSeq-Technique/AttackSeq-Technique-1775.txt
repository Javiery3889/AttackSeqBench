### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where reconnaissance is performed to gather email addresses, followed by the execution of a self-extracting executable to drop and launch the Sayad malware.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the preparation of the malware's malicious capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** Gathering email addresses (T1589.002-Email Addresses).
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** Spearphishing link (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves the development of malware or other malicious capabilities. It is a broad technique that could encompass the preparation of the malware's malicious capabilities.
   - **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL:** This technique involves the use of a network provider DLL to gain access to a network. It does not directly relate to the preparation of the malware's malicious capabilities.
   - **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves the use of social media accounts to gather information or to deliver malware. While it is related to reconnaissance, it does not directly prepare the malware's malicious capabilities.
   - **D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves the discovery of information about a user's browser. It is not directly related to the preparation of the malware's malicious capabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the preparation of the malware's malicious capabilities is **T1587-Develop Capabilities**. This technique directly involves the development of the malware, which is a crucial step before executing it.

**Final Answer: A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
