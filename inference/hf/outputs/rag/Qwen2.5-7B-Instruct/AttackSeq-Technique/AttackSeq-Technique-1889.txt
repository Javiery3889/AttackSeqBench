### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN13 used custom passive backdoors (like BLUEAGAVE) to establish a local HTTP server for incoming requests.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial setup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
     - This technique involves using malicious links to deliver malware or perform actions. It does not directly relate to the establishment of a local HTTP server.
   - **Option B: T1505-Server Software Component**
     - This technique involves using server software components to establish a C2 channel. Given that a local HTTP server was established, this could be a plausible next step.
   - **Option C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the establishment of a local HTTP server.
   - **Option D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
     - This technique involves using messaging applications for C2. It is less likely to follow the establishment of a local HTTP server, as HTTP is a more direct method of communication.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after establishing a local HTTP server, the next step would be to use server software components to maintain the C2 channel. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1505-Server Software Component**
