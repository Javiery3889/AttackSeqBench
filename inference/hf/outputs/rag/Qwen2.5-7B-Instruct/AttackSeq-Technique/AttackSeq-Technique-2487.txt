### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first acquire and prepare infrastructure, then use spear phishing emails to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - The focus is on the infrastructure preparation phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves gathering information about a domain, which is relevant to the infrastructure preparation phase.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spear phishing emails to deliver malware, which is part of the attack sequence but not the infrastructure preparation phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token** - This technique involves creating and using tokens to impersonate a user, which is not directly related to infrastructure preparation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1608.002-Upload Tool** - This technique involves uploading tools to a remote system, which is more related to post-exploitation activities rather than infrastructure preparation.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when a system boots or a user logs on, which is more related to post-exploitation activities.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1587-Develop Capabilities** - This technique involves developing capabilities to support future operations, which can include infrastructure preparation. It aligns well with the context of acquiring and preparing infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the infrastructure preparation phase is **T1587-Develop Capabilities**.

Final Answer: D
