Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary initially gains access through a weaponized link and directs the user to a .wsc file. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the adversary utilized redirections and fileless implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location
- T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking
- T1036-Masquerading

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**: This technique involves creating a rogue domain controller to manipulate authentication and authorization. It does not directly relate to the initial access through a weaponized link or the subsequent evasion techniques.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise. While it is a defense evasion technique, it does not directly relate to the initial access or the use of legitimate tools.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. It could be relevant if the adversary used a scripting language to implement the redirections and fileless techniques, but it does not directly address the initial access or the evasion techniques.
- **T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM)**: This technique involves using the Component Object Model to execute code. It is a fileless technique that can be used to evade defenses by executing code in memory. Given that the question mentions the use of fileless implementations of legitimate tools, this technique is highly relevant.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access through a weaponized link and directing the user to a .wsc file suggests that the adversary is already in the system.
- The question asks for a technique that occurred before the use of redirections and fileless implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses.
- T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM) is a fileless technique that can be used to execute code in memory, which aligns with the use of fileless implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses.
- The related TTPs, such as T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location and T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking, also involve evasion techniques but do not directly address the initial access or the use of fileless techniques.

### Final Answer: D: T1559.001-Component Object Model
