To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first perform some action, then use a C2 database to manage infected systems based on specific information about the target machines. The key points are:
- The attackers use a C2 database.
- The database describes machines receiving a second-stage payload.
- The information used to describe these machines includes running processes, OS version, and installed software.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the question and the related TTPs:

- **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware to the target. It does not directly relate to the use of a C2 database or the discovery of system information.

- **B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols other than HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS for C2 communication. While it relates to C2, it does not directly address the discovery of system information.

- **C: T1059.007-JavaScript**
  - This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code. It does not directly relate to the use of a C2 database or the discovery of system information.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it does not directly address the use of a C2 database or the discovery of system information.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is one that involves the discovery of system information before using a C2 database to manage infected systems. The technique T1082-System Information Discovery directly aligns with the need to gather information about running processes, OS version, and installed software.

**Final Answer: C: T1059.007-JavaScript** (This choice is incorrect based on the context, but the correct answer should be T1082-System Information Discovery, which is not listed in the choices provided.)
