Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. 'Trojan.APT.Seinup' was dropped.
2. DLL side-loading was utilized during the Initial Access phase.
3. The malware registered itself as a Windows service for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence
- Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the TTP that logically follows the initial steps and precedes the registration as a Windows service.

- **A: T1053.003-Cron** - This technique involves using cron jobs for scheduling tasks. It does not directly relate to DLL side-loading or persistence through Windows services.
- **B: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery** - This technique involves inhibiting system recovery mechanisms. It is not directly related to the initial access or persistence through DLL side-loading.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves using shared modules to evade detection. While it can be part of a broader persistence strategy, it does not directly follow the DLL side-loading technique.
- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves gathering information about the victim to tailor the attack. It is a common step after initial access and before persistence, but it does not directly relate to the DLL side-loading technique.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
1. 'Trojan.APT.Seinup' was dropped.
2. DLL side-loading was utilized during the Initial Access phase.
3. The malware then gathers victim identity information (T1589) to tailor the persistence mechanism.
4. Finally, the malware registers itself as a Windows service for persistence.

Therefore, the TTP that most likely occurred after DLL side-loading and before registering as a Windows service is T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information.

**Final Answer: D**
