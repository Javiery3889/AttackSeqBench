Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Mimikatz is used for credential theft.
2. The NTDS.DIT database file is copied.
3. APT10 exfiltrates compressed proprietary data to Dropbox using the cURL command-line tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS**: This technique involves accessing the NTDS.DIT file, which is consistent with the question.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage, which aligns with the exfiltration to Dropbox using cURL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1213.003-Code Repositories**: This technique involves using code repositories to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to the credential access or the exfiltration to Dropbox using cURL.
- **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it is related to credential access, it does not directly describe the exfiltration process.
- **C: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities. It is not directly related to the credential access or the exfiltration process.
- **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving data before exfiltration. It is a plausible step before exfiltrating compressed proprietary data, which aligns with the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where credentials are stolen and data is exfiltrated.
- The related TTPs confirm that the NTDS.DIT file is accessed and data is exfiltrated to cloud storage.
- Among the answer choices, T1560-Archive Collected Data (D) is the most plausible technique that fits the sequence of events, as it involves archiving data before exfiltration.

### Final Answer: D
