Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Enumerating running processes to search for browsers.
2. Generating file listings for exfiltration.
3. Collecting specific visual content on the compromised system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the collection of specific visual content.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves identifying files and directories, which aligns with the generation of file listings.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing screenshots or screen content, which directly aligns with collecting specific visual content.
- **Answer Choice B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves archiving data that has been collected, which is more about the storage of data rather than the collection of visual content.
- **Answer Choice C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**
  - This technique is related to managing application domains, which does not directly align with the collection of visual content.
- **Answer Choice D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering peripheral devices, which is not directly related to the collection of visual content.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the collection of specific visual content, which is best aligned with the T1113-Screen Capture technique.
- The related TTPs, T1005-Data from Local System and T1083-File and Directory Discovery, support the context of data collection and file listing, which are prerequisites for the screen capture.

### Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture
