Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that before FIN13 staged data from network shared drives locally or remotely, a specific ATT&CK technique occurred after the group used tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement. This implies that the technique in question should logically follow the lateral movement and tool usage.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement** - This is the context of the question, indicating that the group is moving laterally within the network.
- **Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools to other systems for lateral movement, which aligns with the use of Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection** - This technique involves collecting email data from local systems. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the lateral movement and tool usage described.
- **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data** - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which would typically occur after the data has been collected and possibly manipulated. It does not directly follow the lateral movement and tool usage.
- **C: T1586.002-Email Accounts** - This technique involves compromising email accounts, which could be part of the initial compromise but does not directly follow the lateral movement and tool usage.
- **D: T1132-Data Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the lateral movement and tool usage.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the technique in question should occur after the group used tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement. This means the technique should be one that directly follows the lateral movement and tool usage.
- Among the given options, **T1132-Data Encoding** (D) is the most plausible because it involves encoding data, which could be a step taken after the data has been collected and before it is staged or archived. This aligns with the sequence of events described in the question.

### Final Answer: D
