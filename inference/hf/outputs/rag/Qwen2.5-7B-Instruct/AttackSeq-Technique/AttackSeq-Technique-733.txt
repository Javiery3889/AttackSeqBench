### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first gained credential access by bypassing two-factor authentication using phishing pages tailored for multiple platforms.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the preparation phase where information was collected on the target's cyber knowledge, contacts, and activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is related to the phishing pages used to bypass two-factor authentication.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique is related to gathering credentials, which is a step after the initial access.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique is related to gathering information about the target, which aligns with the preparation phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations:** This technique is not directly related to the preparation phase or the collection of information about the target.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique is related to scanning for IP blocks, which is more about network reconnaissance rather than gathering information about the target.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique is directly related to gathering information about the target, which fits the preparation phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique is related to bypassing MFA, which is a step after the initial access and not the preparation phase.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the technique T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information occurred during the preparation phase where information was collected on the target's cyber knowledge, contacts, and activities.

**Final Answer: C**
