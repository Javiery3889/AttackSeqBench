### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about how Regin maintains communication with the C2 infrastructure after collecting data using advanced RAT features like screen captures and network traffic monitoring.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication** - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. While this could be a method of communication, it does not directly address the exfiltration or duplication of data.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate the data being sent to the C2 server. This could be a method to avoid detection but does not directly address the exfiltration or duplication of data.
   - **C: T1040-Network Sniffing** - This technique involves monitoring network traffic, which is mentioned in the question as a feature of the RAT. However, it does not directly address the exfiltration or duplication of data.
   - **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection** - This technique involves injecting security identifier (SID) history into the system to maintain persistence. While this could be a method to maintain communication, it does not directly address the exfiltration or duplication of data.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve techniques that directly address the exfiltration and duplication of data. **T1020.001-Traffic Duplication** is specifically about duplicating network traffic to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the question's focus on maintaining communication after data collection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

**Reasoning:**
- The question asks about maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure after data collection, and the related TTPs mention traffic duplication for exfiltration. While application layer protocols (T1071) are a method of communication, they do not directly address the exfiltration or duplication of data. Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1071, as it aligns with the context of maintaining communication through standard protocols.
