Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. Malware is implanted through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
2. Longhorn (a technique) is used to utilize secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack.
- **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the question and related TTPs:

- **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default accounts, which does not align with the described scenario of secure erase protocols and file deletion.
- **B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing, which is not relevant to the described scenario of secure erase protocols and file deletion.
- **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is not the next step after secure erase protocols.
- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the described scenario of secure erase protocols and file deletion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the attacker uses secure erase protocols (renaming and overwriting) to avoid detection.
- The related TTPs mention **T1070.004-File Deletion** and **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**, which are techniques for removing evidence of the attack.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal** (Answer Choice D) is the most relevant technique as it encompasses the removal of indicators of compromise, which aligns with the described secure erase protocols and file deletion.

### Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
