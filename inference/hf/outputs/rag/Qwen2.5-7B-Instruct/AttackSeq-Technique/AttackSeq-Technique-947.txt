### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Sednit group's malware first scans for files with specific extensions and stages data containing paths of files to exfiltrate.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the staging of data but before the exfiltration of the data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Collection Tactic:** The malware is scanning for files with specific extensions, which is a form of data collection.
   - **Remote Data Staging (T1074.002):** This technique involves the malware staging data containing paths of files to exfiltrate.
   - **Exfiltration Tactic:** The data is eventually exfiltrated over a C&C channel (T1041).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **B: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing data from web portals, which is also not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **D: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves establishing a network connection to bridge network boundaries, which is more related to the exfiltration process rather than the staging of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the technique that occurs after the staging of data but before the exfiltration. Given the context, the technique that fits best is one that might involve further processing or preparation of the data before exfiltration. However, none of the provided options directly fit this description. The closest fit, though not a perfect match, is **T1070-Indicator Removal**, as it could be a step in preparing the data for exfiltration by removing any indicators that might be detected.

### Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal
