### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of proxy tools (like Ngrok) for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
   - The goal is to identify the most likely ATT&CK technique that would follow these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This is relevant as it involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network.
   - **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique is directly related to the use of proxy tools like Ngrok for communication.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**: This is relevant for the broader context of the attack, but not directly tied to the specific sequence described.
   - **Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This is less relevant to the specific sequence described, as it involves using chat messages for credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves signaling to a C2 server to initiate a data exfiltration or other action. Given the context of using proxy tools for communication, this could be a plausible next step.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. While this could be a method of communication, it is not as directly related to the use of proxy tools as T1205.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service for C2 communication. While this could be a method of communication, it is not as directly related to the use of proxy tools as T1205.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This is more about executing commands rather than establishing communication, which is the focus of the question.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that follows the use of proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration to establish communication with malicious external websites is T1205-Traffic Signaling.

**Final Answer: A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
