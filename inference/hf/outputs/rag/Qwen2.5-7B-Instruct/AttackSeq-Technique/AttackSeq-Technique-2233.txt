### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Grabit malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server for downloading itself via a malicious macro.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely happened to maintain persistence on the infected system after the malware has been downloaded.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **Persistence Techniques:**
       - T1053.005-Scheduled Task
       - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
     - **Exfiltration Techniques:**
       - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple methods to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the initial execution or autostart of the malware.
   - **Option B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that the malware runs when the system boots or when a user logs on. This is a direct method to maintain persistence, which aligns well with the scenario of the malware needing to stay active on the system.
   - **Option C: T1546.011-Application Shimming**
     - This technique involves modifying the behavior of legitimate applications to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct method for ensuring the malware runs on system boot or logon.
   - **Option D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**
     - This technique involves changing file associations to execute malicious code when a user opens a file. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct method for ensuring the malware runs on system boot or logon.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to maintain persistence on the infected system after the malware has been downloaded via an HTTP request is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B**
