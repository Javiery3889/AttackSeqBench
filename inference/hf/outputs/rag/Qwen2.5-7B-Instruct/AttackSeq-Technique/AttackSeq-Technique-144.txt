### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Phosphorus group first exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities to gain access to a Microsoft Exchange Server.
   - After gaining access, they deployed the PowerLess Backdoor.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial access and deployment of the backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application."
   - T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the technique used to gain initial access to the system by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial access method. It does not fit as a subsequent technique after deploying the backdoor.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a user through a malicious website or drive-by download. It does not directly relate to the deployment of a backdoor on an already compromised system.
   - **C: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS to resolve domain names. While it can be used for command and control (C2) communications, it is not the most direct or likely technique to follow the deployment of a backdoor.
   - **D: T1112-Modify Registry**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to persist the backdoor or maintain access. This is a common method to ensure the backdoor remains active and the attacker can maintain control over the system.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access and deployment of the PowerLess Backdoor would be to modify the registry to ensure persistence. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D: T1112-Modify Registry
