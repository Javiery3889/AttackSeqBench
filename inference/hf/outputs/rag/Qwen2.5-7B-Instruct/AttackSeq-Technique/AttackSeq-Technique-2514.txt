Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tools like PsExec and WinExe are used for lateral movement.
2. GreyEnergy obtained domain administrator privileges by collecting passwords.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is relevant as it involves gaining access to the network.
- **T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique is related to the collection of domain accounts, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting passwords.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services to establish a foothold. While it could be part of the initial access, it does not directly align with the collection of passwords.
- **B: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution**
  - This technique involves using dynamic API resolution to bypass security mechanisms. It is not directly related to the collection of passwords.
- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold. Similar to T1133, it is more about initial access rather than the collection of passwords.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to obtain credentials. It is directly related to the collection of passwords, which aligns with the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions tools like PsExec and WinExe, which are used for lateral movement. This suggests an initial access technique.
- **Collection of Passwords**: The question states that GreyEnergy obtained domain administrator privileges by collecting passwords. This directly points to a technique involving the collection of credentials.
- **Alignment with Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention T1078.002-Domain Accounts, which is about collecting domain accounts, aligning with the collection of passwords.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves phishing to obtain credentials.

### Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
