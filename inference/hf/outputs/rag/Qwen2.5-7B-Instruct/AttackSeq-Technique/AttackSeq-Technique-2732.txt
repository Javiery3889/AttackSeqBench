Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus group:
1. Executed credential harvesting using Responder.
2. Gained login credentials for lateral movement.
3. Continued with network share and system network connections discovery activities.

We need to identify which TTP most likely occurred before the network share and system network connections discovery activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
  - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. It is not directly related to the network sniffing or credential harvesting described in the question.

- **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network connections. However, the question asks for a TTP that occurred before the network share and system network connections discovery activities. This technique is more likely to occur after the discovery phase.

- **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering the system owner or user. While it is related to the discovery tactic, it is not directly linked to the credential harvesting or network sniffing described in the question.

- **D: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves sniffing network traffic to capture credentials or other sensitive information. It aligns well with the credential harvesting using Responder and the network sniffing mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the group first harvested credentials and then moved laterally. Network sniffing (T1040) is a common technique used to capture credentials during the initial phase of an attack.
- The related TTPs mention network sniffing in the context of both credential access and discovery, indicating its relevance to the described attack sequence.
- System network connections discovery (T1049) and system owner/user discovery (T1033) are more likely to occur after the initial credential harvesting and lateral movement.

### Final Answer: D: T1040-Network Sniffing
