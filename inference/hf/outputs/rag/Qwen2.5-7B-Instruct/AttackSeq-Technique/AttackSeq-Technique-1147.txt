### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the GroundPeony campaign uses DLL side-loading with "version.dll" to decode and launch shellcode.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to facilitate communication with the C&C server after the DLL side-loading.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading" under the tactics of Persistence and Defense Evasion. This confirms that DLL side-loading is a key technique in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
     - Fast Flux DNS is a technique used to evade detection by rapidly changing the IP addresses associated with a domain. While it can be used for persistence and evasion, it is not directly related to facilitating communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - Shared Modules involve the use of common libraries or modules to evade detection. This technique is more about hiding the malicious code rather than facilitating communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
     - Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites is a technique used to exfiltrate data to a remote server, typically for data theft. It is not directly related to facilitating communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - Application Layer Protocol involves the use of standard network protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server. This technique is directly related to establishing and maintaining communication with a C&C server, which aligns with the question's requirement.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
