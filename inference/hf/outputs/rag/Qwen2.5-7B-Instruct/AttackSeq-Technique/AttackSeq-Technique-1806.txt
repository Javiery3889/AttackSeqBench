Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Equation Editor vulnerabilities are exploited.
2. The 'intel.wll' file is dropped.
3. The 'intel.wll' file serves to maintain malware persistence upon relaunching Microsoft Word.
4. Subsequent stages of the infection chain are downloaded and decrypted from the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client system.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate application to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This technique involves adding malicious add-ins to applications to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves configuring the system to run malware at boot or logon. While it is a persistence technique, it does not directly relate to the initial exploitation and downloading of subsequent stages from the C&C server.
- **B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols to exfiltrate data or deliver malware. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about downloading and decrypting subsequent stages from the C&C server.
- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it is related to the initial exploitation of the Equation Editor vulnerabilities, it does not directly address the downloading and decrypting of subsequent stages.
- **D: T1205.002-Socket Filters**: This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it could be used to download and decrypt subsequent stages, it is not the most direct or relevant technique in this context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial exploitation of the Equation Editor vulnerabilities (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution) is a prerequisite.
- The 'intel.wll' file is dropped to maintain persistence (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading).
- The subsequent stages are downloaded and decrypted from the C&C server, which is a critical step in the infection chain.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before downloading and decrypting subsequent stages is the initial exploitation of the vulnerability to execute the payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** (Although this is not the most direct answer, it is the closest to the initial exploitation step in the sequence provided by the related TTPs.)
