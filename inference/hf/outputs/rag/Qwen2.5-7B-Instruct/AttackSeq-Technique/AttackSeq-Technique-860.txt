Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Administrator accounts are compromised.
2. Tools for privilege escalation are installed.
3. Scheduled system tasks are used with compromised credentials for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1053.002-At: This technique involves using the "at" command to schedule tasks.
- T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks.
- T1078-Valid Accounts: This technique involves using valid user accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before the use of scheduled system tasks with compromised credentials for lateral movement.

- **Option A: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
  - This technique involves using a user's hash to authenticate without needing the password. It is a method of privilege escalation but does not directly involve scheduled tasks or lateral movement.
  
- **Option B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the use of scheduled tasks or lateral movement.
  
- **Option C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternative authentication material, which could be relevant to privilege escalation but does not directly involve scheduled tasks or lateral movement.
  
- **Option D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid user accounts, which could be a step in the process of lateral movement but does not directly involve scheduled tasks.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence would involve:
1. Compromising administrator accounts (implied in the question).
2. Privilege escalation (implied in the question).
3. Using valid accounts (T1078) to gather compromised credentials.
4. Using these credentials to create or use scheduled tasks (T1053.005) for lateral movement.

Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the use of scheduled system tasks with compromised credentials for lateral movement is T1078-Valid Accounts.

**Final Answer: C**
