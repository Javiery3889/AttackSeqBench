### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Babar (a hypothetical malware) uses remote thread injection to communicate with its C&C servers. Before this, it needs to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots or video of the screen, which is not directly related to capturing data from desktop applications.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to capture credentials, which is more related to accessing credentials rather than capturing data from desktop applications.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This is the same as the previous related TTP, which is about capturing credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is a form of data capture from desktop applications. It fits the context of capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique is about exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the standard network protocol, which is not directly related to capturing data from desktop applications.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture:** As mentioned earlier, this technique is about capturing screenshots or video, which is not directly related to capturing data from desktop applications.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is not directly related to capturing data from desktop applications.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **T1056.001-Keylogging**.

**Final Answer: A: T1056.001-Keylogging**
