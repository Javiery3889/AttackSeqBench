Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Operators staged data for exfiltration.
2. They scanned for files with specific extensions.
3. They created a file containing paths of all files to retrieve.
4. Data were hex-encoded and encrypted for transmission.
5. The transmission occurred over a fallback C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection Tactic**: T1560-Archive Collected Data
- **Exfiltration Tactic**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
- This technique involves using a fallback communication channel in case the primary channel is detected or blocked.
- It aligns with the part of the question where data are transmitted over a fallback C&C server.

**B: T1113-Screen Capture**
- This technique involves capturing screenshots or video of the screen.
- It does not align with the described data exfiltration process.

**C: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
- This technique involves using multiple authentication factors.
- It does not align with the described data exfiltration process.

**D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
- This technique involves encapsulating data within another protocol to evade detection.
- While it could be part of the exfiltration process, it does not directly address the fallback C&C server aspect.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions leading to data exfiltration over a fallback C&C server.
- The related TTPs mention T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which aligns with the fallback C&C server.
- Among the answer choices, T1008-Fallback Channels (A) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the use of a fallback communication channel.

### Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels
