Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. A malicious document with a custom Pterodo backdoor is used for initial access.
2. Shuckworm executes VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred after the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1657-Financial Theft**
- This technique is related to stealing financial information, which does not directly follow the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files. It is not a technique for maintaining persistence or execution.

**B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
- This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed every time the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files, as these are often used to create registry entries or scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.

**C: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
- This technique involves the use of dynamic data exchange protocols to exfiltrate data. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly follow the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files in the context of maintaining persistence.

**D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
- This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to run malware at a later time. This is a common method to maintain persistence after initial execution, aligning well with the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of VBS scripts and HTA files is a method to maintain persistence.
- Both T1547 and T1053 are related to maintaining persistence.
- T1547 specifically mentions boot or logon autostart execution, which is a broader method that includes scheduled tasks.
- T1053 is more specific to creating scheduled tasks, which is a subset of T1547.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, as it directly follows the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files to ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
