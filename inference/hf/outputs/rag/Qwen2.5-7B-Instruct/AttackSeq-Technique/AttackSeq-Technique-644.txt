Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where spear-phishing emails are used for initial access, and then tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available Remote Access Tools (RATs) are deployed.
   - The question is asking which ATT&CK technique best describes the deployment of these tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and specifically "Spearphishing Link" as techniques.
   - This indicates that the sequence starts with the initial access via spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates** - This technique is about using code signing certificates to sign malicious code, which is not directly related to deploying tools after initial access.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities** - This technique involves obtaining the ability to perform actions on a system, which could be relevant but is more about gaining capabilities rather than deploying specific tools.
   - **C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement** - This technique is about defacing internal systems, which is not relevant to the deployment of tools after initial access.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This is the initial access technique mentioned in the question, but it does not describe the deployment of tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves deploying tools after initial access. The technique that best describes the deployment of custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs is T1569.001-Deploy Backdoor.
   - However, since T1569.001 is not listed in the choices, the closest and most relevant technique from the given options is T1588-Obtain Capabilities, as it involves gaining the ability to perform actions on a system, which could include deploying tools.

Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
