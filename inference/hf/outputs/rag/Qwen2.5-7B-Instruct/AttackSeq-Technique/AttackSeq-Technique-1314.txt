### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicStrand modifies firmware to redirect execution to attacker-supplied code, which is a form of defense evasion.
   - The next step in the sequence is communication with a C2 server using crafted UDP or TCP packets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This is the initial context, indicating that the attacker is trying to avoid detection.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using network traffic to signal the presence of malicious activity, which is not directly related to the communication method.
   - **Command and Control (Tactic):**
     - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication, which is a common method but not specifically mentioned in the question.
     - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication, which is also a common method but not specifically mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1014-Rootkit**
     - This technique involves using a rootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection. While it is related to the initial defense evasion, it does not directly address the communication method.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain C2 communication. This could be relevant if the attacker uses a fallback method in case the primary channel is detected.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection. While it is related to data handling, it does not directly address the communication method.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using non-application layer protocols (like UDP or TCP) for C2 communication. This directly addresses the use of crafted UDP or TCP packets mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: D
