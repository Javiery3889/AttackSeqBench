Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where TDrop2 malware has retrieved a second-stage payload disguised as an image file. The next step in the attack sequence is to collect information about specific paths on the infected system during the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the tactics and techniques involved in the attack:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type**: This technique involves disguising files to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making files or processes appear to be something else to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique is most likely to be used during the reconnaissance phase to collect information about specific paths on the infected system.

- **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network. It does not fit the context of collecting information about specific paths.
- **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves identifying files and directories on a system, which aligns with the need to collect information about specific paths.
- **C: T1069.002-Domain Groups**: This technique involves querying domain groups, which is not directly related to collecting information about specific paths on the infected system.
- **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data difficult to understand, which does not fit the context of collecting information about specific paths.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already retrieved a second-stage payload disguised as an image file, indicating a need to gather more information about the system.
- The related TTPs suggest that the malware is using techniques to evade detection, such as masquerading file types.
- The most relevant technique for collecting information about specific paths on the infected system during the reconnaissance phase is T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

### Final Answer: B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
