Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that facilitated the introduction of ShadowPad into victim environments through supply-chain attacks like CCleaner, NetSarang, and ASUS supply-chain attacks. The key here is the initial introduction and the use of supply-chain attacks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL from a location that is not in the system's default search path.
- **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to introduce malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique directly aligns with the question's context of supply-chain attacks. It involves compromising a software supply chain to introduce malicious code.
  - The related TTPs mention T1195.002, which is a specific sub-technique of T1195 that fits the context of supply-chain attacks.

- **Answer Choice B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage**
  - This technique is related to memory management and does not directly pertain to the initial introduction or supply-chain attack context.

- **Answer Choice C: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
  - This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware, which is not directly related to supply-chain attacks.

- **Answer Choice D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique is about developing capabilities, which is not directly related to the initial introduction or supply-chain attack context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the initial introduction of ShadowPad through supply-chain attacks.
- The related TTPs mention T1195.002, which is a specific sub-technique of T1195 that fits the context of supply-chain attacks.
- Among the answer choices, T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (A) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the context of the question.

### Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
