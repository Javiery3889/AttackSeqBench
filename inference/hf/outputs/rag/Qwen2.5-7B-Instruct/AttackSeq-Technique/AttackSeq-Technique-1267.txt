Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Blind Eagle utilized a JavaScript downloader employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
2. The next step is to achieve persistence with a VBScript placed in the Startup folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which TTPs align with the sequence described in the question.

- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands. The question mentions that Blind Eagle utilized a JavaScript downloader to execute PowerShell commands, which aligns with this technique.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves placing a script in the Startup folder to achieve persistence. The question states that the next step is to achieve persistence with a VBScript placed in the Startup folder, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Determine the Sequence
The sequence described in the question is:
1. Execution using PowerShell (T1059.001-PowerShell)
2. Persistence using a VBScript in the Startup folder (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder)

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
- **A: T1559.001-Component Object Model**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **D: T1218.007-Msiexec**: This technique is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1059.001-PowerShell (Execution)
2. T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (Persistence)

### Final Answer: 
Final Answer: A (T1059.001-PowerShell) and D (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) are the correct techniques, but since the question asks for a single answer choice, the most direct and relevant technique for the first step in the sequence is T1059.001-PowerShell.
