### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of techniques leading up to the use of a signed payload.dylib exploiting CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and bypass defenses on infected iOS devices.
   - The focus is on the initial steps that would precede the exploitation of the specific vulnerability.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step in the attack lifecycle where the adversary gains a foothold in the target environment.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly accessible application to gain access to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique is about evading detection and defenses once the initial access has been achieved. It does not fit as the initial step.
   - **B: T1220-XSL Script Processing:** This technique involves processing XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) files, which is not directly related to the exploitation of a public-facing application or the use of a signed payload.
   - **C: T1583.007-Serverless:** This technique involves using serverless computing to execute malicious code. While it can be part of an attack, it is not directly related to the initial access or the exploitation of a specific vulnerability.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique directly aligns with the question as it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which is a common initial access vector for malware like lightSpy.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is the initial access through exploiting a public-facing application. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
