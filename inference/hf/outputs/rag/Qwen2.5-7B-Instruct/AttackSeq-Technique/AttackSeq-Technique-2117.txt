Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the initial technique used in the A41APT campaign to gain access to the target network before deploying tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` to dump credentials. This implies that the initial technique should be related to gaining access to the network, which is part of the "Initial Access" phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**

These techniques are related to credential access and dumping, which are part of the "Credential Access" tactic. However, the question is specifically asking about the initial technique used to gain access to the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules to gain access to a system. It is not directly related to the "Initial Access" phase but could be part of the post-exploitation phase.

- **B: T1611-Escape to Host**
  - This technique involves moving from a guest or virtual machine to the host system. It is not directly related to the initial access phase but could be part of the post-exploitation phase.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a system. This is a plausible initial access technique as it could be used to establish a foothold in the network.

- **D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to gain access to the target network. It is a plausible initial access technique but is more complex and less likely to be the first step in a simple APT campaign.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the initial technique used to gain access to the network.
- The related TTPs are more focused on credential access and dumping, which are part of the "Credential Access" tactic.
- Among the given choices, **T1133-External Remote Services (C)** is the most plausible initial access technique as it directly relates to gaining access to the network.

### Final Answer: C
