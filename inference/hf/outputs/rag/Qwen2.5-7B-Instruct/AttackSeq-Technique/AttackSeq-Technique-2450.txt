Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Elise malware initiates ipaddress.com queries to obtain WAN IP addresses.
2. The malware leverages system network configuration details to further its profiling activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice to see which one aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1087.003-Email Account**
  - This technique involves using email accounts, which is not directly related to the described sequence of initiating ipaddress.com queries and leveraging system network configuration details.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting public-facing applications, which is not directly related to the described sequence of initiating ipaddress.com queries and leveraging system network configuration details.

- **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware, which is not directly related to the described sequence of initiating ipaddress.com queries and leveraging system network configuration details.

- **D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering system network configuration details, which aligns with the described sequence of the malware leveraging system network configuration details to further its profiling activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware initiating ipaddress.com queries to obtain WAN IP addresses, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- The malware then uses system network configuration details to further its profiling activities, which is a clear indication of the T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery technique.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, which further supports this choice.

### Final Answer: D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
