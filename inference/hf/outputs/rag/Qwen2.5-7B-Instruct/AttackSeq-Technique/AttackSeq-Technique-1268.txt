### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Yellow Garuda (a hypothetical adversary) maintained persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template with a macro-enabled malicious template.
   - The key TTPs involved are persistence and the use of Office template macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.001-Office Template Macros:** This directly relates to the act of replacing the default Microsoft Word template with a malicious one.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious content into templates, which aligns with the scenario of replacing the default template.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into a file or document. While it can be part of a broader attack, it does not specifically address the act of replacing the default template.
   - **B: T1137-Office Application Startup:** This technique involves configuring an Office application to run at startup. While it can be a method of persistence, it does not directly address the act of replacing the default template.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking a user into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. While phishing can be used to deliver malicious templates, it does not directly address the act of replacing the default template.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves manipulating resource forks in files, which is not directly related to the act of replacing the default template.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is the act of replacing the default template with a malicious one, which is directly addressed by the technique T1137.001-Office Template Macros.

**Final Answer: B**
