### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already bypassed blocking of active C&C servers through Telegram channels and executed malicious stealers to gather system and sensitive data.
   - The next step in the sequence is to obscure communication between systems and maintain access undetected.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for C2 to avoid detection.
     - **Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves using bidirectional communication channels to maintain persistent access.
     - **Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback channels to maintain C2 communication in case the primary channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services for C2 communication. While it can be used to maintain access, it does not directly address the need to obscure communication and maintain undetected access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services for C2 communication. Similar to web services, it can be used to maintain access but does not directly address the need to obscure communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
     - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to maintain access. It is more about maintaining access through authentication rather than obscuring communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique involves using traffic signaling to maintain C2 communication. It is specifically designed to obscure the nature of the communication and make it harder to detect.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to obscure communication between systems and maintain access undetected is **T1205-Traffic Signaling**.

**Final Answer: D**
