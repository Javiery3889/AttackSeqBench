Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already used discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts. The next step in the sequence is establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for command and control, it doesn't directly relate to the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communication.

- **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
  - This technique is about disrupting network services, which is not relevant to establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically mentions using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control. This aligns well with the question's description of establishing communication using these protocols.

- **D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs for command and control, which is not directly related to the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already used discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts.
- The next step is establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a sub-technique of T1071 and specifically involves using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the use of HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

### Final Answer: C
