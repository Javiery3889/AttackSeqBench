Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after ChChes establishes communication with its C&C servers, it uses encrypted HTTP requests to receive commands and modules. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before this step.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Command and Control**
  - **Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a method of tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.
- **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - Encrypted channels are used to secure communication, which aligns with the use of encrypted HTTP requests mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
  - Spearphishing via service is a specific type of phishing, which again is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.
- **Answer Choice D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
  - SID history injection is a technique used to modify security identifiers, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that ChChes uses encrypted HTTP requests to receive commands and modules after establishing communication with its C&C servers.
- The related TTPs include T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is directly related to using web protocols for command and control.
- Among the answer choices, T1573-Encrypted Channel (Answer Choice B) is the most relevant because it involves using encrypted channels, which aligns with the use of encrypted HTTP requests in the question.

### Final Answer: B
