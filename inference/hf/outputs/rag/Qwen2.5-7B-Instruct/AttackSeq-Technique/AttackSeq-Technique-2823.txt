### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Hacking Team's spyware gained initial access by disguising an executable file as a PDF document and delivering it via a spearphishing email.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - This indicates that the initial method of gaining access was through a spearphishing email with a malicious PDF file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves disguising malicious files to appear legitimate. While it is related to the initial disguise of the executable file as a PDF, it does not describe what happens after the initial access.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is broader and encompasses the use of phishing to deliver malicious content. However, it is more about the method of delivery rather than what happens after the initial access.
   - **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. This could be a plausible technique that might occur after the initial access to further evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **D: T1647-Plist File Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying macOS plist files to evade detection. While it is a technique used to maintain persistence, it is not directly related to the initial access method described.

### Final Answer:
- **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing** is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question. After gaining initial access via a spearphishing email, the spyware would likely use process hollowing to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, thereby evading detection and maintaining persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
