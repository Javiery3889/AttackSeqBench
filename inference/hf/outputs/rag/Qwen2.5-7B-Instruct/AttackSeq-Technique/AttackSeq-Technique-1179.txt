Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Obfuscated PowerShell scripts are used to bypass AppLocker.
2. A backdoor collects machine IP address information by querying external services.
3. The backdoor registers with the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery**: This includes techniques like T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This includes techniques like T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.
- **Tactic: Execution**: This includes techniques like T1059.001-PowerShell.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before the backdoor collected machine IP address information.

- **Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could include network configuration details. This aligns well with the need to discover the machine's IP address before querying external services.

- **Answer Choice B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering the system owner or user, which is not directly related to the IP address collection.

- **Answer Choice C: T1552.003-Bash History**
  - This technique involves accessing the bash history, which is not directly related to the IP address collection.

- **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information, which is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial step (bypassing AppLocker).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that the backdoor collects machine IP address information by querying external services. This suggests that the backdoor needs to know the IP address before it can register with the C&C server.
- The related TTPs mention T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, which is a technique under the Discovery tactic. This technique is directly related to gathering network configuration details, including IP addresses.
- The other techniques (T1033, T1552.003, and T1027) do not directly relate to the IP address collection.

### Final Answer: A: T1082-System Information Discovery
