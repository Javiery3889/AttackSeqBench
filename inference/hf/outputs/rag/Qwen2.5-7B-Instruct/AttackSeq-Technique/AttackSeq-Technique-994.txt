### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attacker connected to the C2 server using the CARBANAK RAT and executed additional payloads through reflection methods to establish backdoor access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves the attacker injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves the attacker using multiple channels to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the attacker transferring tools to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves the attacker using native APIs to perform actions on the system. While it is related to process injection, it does not directly address the sequence of events before connecting to the C2 server.
   - **B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI:** This technique involves the attacker using a command-line interface on a network device. It does not directly relate to the sequence of events before connecting to the C2 server.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves the attacker using non-standard ports for communication. While it is related to command and control, it does not directly address the sequence of events before connecting to the C2 server.
   - **D: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves the attacker using shared content to spread malware. It does not directly relate to the sequence of events before connecting to the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** (related to T1104-Multi-Stage Channels), as it involves the attacker transferring tools to the target system, which would be a necessary step before using the CARBANAK RAT to connect to the C2 server and execute additional payloads.

   **Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port** (Note: The correct answer choice should be T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, but based on the provided choices, C is the closest match to the context of the question.)
