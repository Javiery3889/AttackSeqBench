Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Attackers executed macros in Microsoft Word documents.
2. They downloaded the Pierogi backdoor.
3. They achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to achieve persistence.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding entries to the registry to ensure the malware runs at startup.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**: This technique is about hiding files and directories, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **B: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves using cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the described sequence.
- **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves discovering system owner/user information, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is not directly related to the described sequence.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique is directly related to adding a shortcut to the startup folder, which is the final step in achieving persistence as described in the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly listed in the provided choices, but based on the context and the related TTPs, the closest match is:

**Final Answer: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** (though it is not one of the provided answer choices).
