### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT12 uses spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to gain initial access to their targets.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoors (HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT) established communication with their respective C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access technique used by APT12 is spear phishing, which can be either via a link (T1566.002) or an attachment (T1566.001).
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of the payload, which is described by the technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
     - SSH Hijacking is a technique where an attacker takes over an existing SSH session. This is not directly related to the initial exploitation or execution of a payload via spear phishing.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control. This is more relevant to the C2 communication phase rather than the initial exploitation phase.
   - **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
     - Process Hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious code. This technique is more relevant to the execution phase after initial access, not the initial access phase.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While this can be part of the post-exploitation phase, it is not the most likely technique to occur immediately after initial access via spear phishing and exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the execution of the payload after the initial access via spear phishing. The technique that best fits this description is T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which is not directly listed as an answer choice but is implied by the related TTPs.

However, since the question asks for a specific technique that occurs before the backdoors establish communication, and none of the provided options directly match the execution phase, the closest and most plausible answer based on the provided choices would be:

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**

This is because T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the closest to the C2 communication phase, which logically follows the initial access and payload execution.
