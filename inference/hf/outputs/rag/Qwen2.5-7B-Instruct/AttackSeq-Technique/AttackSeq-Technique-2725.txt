### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a custom tunneling tool is used for data exfiltration.
   - The goal is to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments using a compromised router.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols, which aligns with the use of a custom tunneling tool.
   - **T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves creating a connection between network segments that are normally isolated, which fits the scenario of enabling communication between corporate and restricted network segments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1070.006-Timestomp:** This technique involves modifying the timestamp of a file to evade detection. It does not align with the scenario of enabling communication between network segments.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is related to T1090.001 but does not directly involve tunneling.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network configurations, which is not directly related to enabling communication between network segments.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using a protocol that is not typically used for the application layer to exfiltrate data. While it involves tunneling, it does not directly address the scenario of enabling communication between network segments.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the scenario of enabling communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router is **T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**.

**Final Answer: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**
