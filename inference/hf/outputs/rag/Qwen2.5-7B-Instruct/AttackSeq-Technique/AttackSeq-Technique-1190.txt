Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malicious macros are used to download payloads, enabling subsequent activities. We need to identify which technique most likely occurs after the execution of these malicious macros.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

- **A: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves the user executing a file, which aligns with the initial execution of malicious macros. However, it does not directly describe the subsequent activities that enable further actions.

- **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing network traffic, which is not directly related to the execution of malicious macros or the downloading of payloads. It is more about monitoring network traffic rather than enabling further activities.

- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. This aligns well with the idea of enabling subsequent activities after the initial execution of malicious macros and downloading of payloads.

- **D: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
  - This technique involves using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to boot a system. While it is a method of booting, it is not directly related to the execution of malicious macros or the downloading of payloads.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where malicious macros are used to download payloads, enabling further activities.
- T1204.002-Malicious File (related TTP) indicates the initial execution of malicious macros.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (related TTP) ensures that malware is executed at system boot or logon, which aligns with enabling further activities after the initial execution.

### Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
