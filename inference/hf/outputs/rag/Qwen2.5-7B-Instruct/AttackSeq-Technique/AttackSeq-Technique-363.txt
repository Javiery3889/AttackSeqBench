### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN8 used a script (mimi.ps1) to read the memory of `lsass.exe` for credential dumping.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this credential dumping but before conducting system fingerprinting with `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Credential Access" and the technique "T1003.001-LSASS Memory," which aligns with the credential dumping activity described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (VDSO) to perform privilege escalation. It does not directly relate to credential dumping or system fingerprinting.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping** - This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. The question mentions that the script (mimi.ps1) was used to read the memory of `lsass.exe` for credential dumping, which aligns with T1003.001-LSASS Memory.
   - **C: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network connections and is more related to reconnaissance and network activity rather than credential dumping or system fingerprinting.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain** - This technique involves accessing keychain data, which is more specific to macOS and iOS environments. It does not align with the described Windows-based credential dumping activity.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the credential dumping with the script (mimi.ps1) aligns with T1003.001-LSASS Memory, and the next step would be conducting system fingerprinting with `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after the credential dumping but before the system fingerprinting is:

**Final Answer: B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
