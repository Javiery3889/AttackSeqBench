Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Stuxnet:
1. Evaded detection using rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates.
2. Communicated with C&C servers using encrypted HTTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: This indicates that the communication with C&C servers is via web protocols.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1553.002-Code Signing)**: This indicates that the malware used code signing to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1542-Pre-OS Boot
- **Description**: This technique involves modifying the boot process to ensure the malware runs before the operating system is fully loaded.
- **Relevance**: While this could be part of the initial infection vector, it does not directly relate to the communication with C&C servers or the use of encrypted HTTP.

#### B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice
- **Description**: This technique involves using voice-based phishing to deliver malware.
- **Relevance**: This is not directly related to the communication with C&C servers or the use of encrypted HTTP.

#### C: T1080-Taint Shared Content
- **Description**: This technique involves infecting shared content (e.g., documents, web pages) to spread malware.
- **Relevance**: This could be a plausible initial infection vector, but it does not directly relate to the communication with C&C servers or the use of encrypted HTTP.

#### D: T1021.004-SSH
- **Description**: This technique involves using SSH (Secure Shell) for command and control.
- **Relevance**: This is directly related to the communication with C&C servers, but it does not use web protocols (HTTP) as specified in the question.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is one that involves an initial infection vector (which could be tainting shared content) and then the use of web protocols (HTTP) for C&C communication.

The best answer choice is:
**C: T1080-Taint Shared Content**

Final Answer: C
