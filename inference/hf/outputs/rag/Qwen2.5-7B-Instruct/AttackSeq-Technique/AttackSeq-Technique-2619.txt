Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where sensitive data is collected from victims' mobile devices and then exfiltrated using communication with different IPs, including both Iranian and Russian locations. The key points are:
- Data collection from mobile devices (contact lists, phone call records, geo-location).
- Exfiltration of the collected data.
- Communication with various IPs, including Iranian and Russian locations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Exfiltration**: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the source of the data exfiltration. While it can help in exfiltrating data, it doesn't directly address the communication with different IPs for exfiltration.
  
- **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the exfiltration process or the communication with different IPs.

- **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to IP addresses. While it can be used to establish communication with different IPs, it is more about the resolution process rather than the exfiltration itself.

- **D: T1037.005-Startup Items**
  - This technique involves using startup items to maintain persistence. It is more about maintaining access rather than the exfiltration process.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This technique directly addresses the communication with different IPs for exfiltrating the stolen data.

**Final Answer: D**
