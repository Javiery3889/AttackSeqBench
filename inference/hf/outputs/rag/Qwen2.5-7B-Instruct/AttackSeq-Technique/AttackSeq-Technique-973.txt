### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Aria-body backdoor gathers extensive system information during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to support the group's objective during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques under the Discovery phase:
     - T1082-System Information Discovery
     - T1083-File and Directory Discovery

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the operating system, hardware, and software configurations. This aligns with the "gathering extensive system information" mentioned in the question.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying files and directories on the system, which is also part of gathering system information but more focused on specific files and directories.

4. **Determine the Collection Phase:**
   - The Collection phase involves the systematic gathering of information to be used for a malicious purpose.
   - Given that the Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information, the next logical step would be to collect more specific data that can be used for further exploitation or to maintain persistence.

5. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **C: T1564.002-Hidden Users:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating hidden or non-interactive users, which is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes, which is more related to identifying active processes rather than collecting system information.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve techniques that directly support the collection of system information. Given the context, the most relevant technique would be one that captures more specific data that can be used for further exploitation.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture

**Reasoning:**
- While T1113-Screen Capture is not directly related to the collection of system information, it is the most plausible choice among the given options. The other choices (T1056-Input Capture, T1564.002-Hidden Users, and T1057-Process Discovery) are more specific and less likely to be the next step in the collection phase after gathering extensive system information.
