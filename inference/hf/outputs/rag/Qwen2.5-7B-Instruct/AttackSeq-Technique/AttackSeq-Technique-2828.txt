Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. File transfers and execution of arbitrary commands are used for data gathering.
2. Communication with C2 infrastructure is enabled over the Cloudflare Workers service.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique is about gathering data from the local system. While it fits the initial data gathering step, it does not directly address the communication with C2 infrastructure.

- **B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using a web service for command and control (C2) communication. Cloudflare Workers is a web service, so this could be a plausible choice for enabling communication with C2 infrastructure.

- **C: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**
  - This technique involves using a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) driver for persistence or data exfiltration. It does not directly address the communication with C2 infrastructure.

- **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for C2 communication. While it is related to C2 communication, it does not specifically mention a web service like Cloudflare Workers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the communication with C2 infrastructure is enabled over the Cloudflare Workers service.
- Cloudflare Workers is a web service, which aligns with the T1102-Web Service technique.
- The T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel techniques are related to exfiltration but do not directly address the web service aspect.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that fits the question and the related TTPs is:

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
