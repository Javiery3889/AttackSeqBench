Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where SBDH malware gains initial access through a phishing email that disguises executable attachments with legitimate-looking icons. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

This indicates that the initial access was achieved through a spearphishing attachment, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1137-Office Application Startup**
  - This technique involves the attacker using a legitimate-looking application to start a malicious process. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.
  
- **B: T1059.001-PowerShell**
  - This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands or scripts. It is a common method for post-exploitation activities, but it doesn't directly follow the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.
  
- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs as the initial access method. It doesn't describe a subsequent step.
  
- **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves the attacker using compromised cloud accounts to gain access to additional resources. While it is a post-exploitation technique, it doesn't directly follow the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access was achieved through a spearphishing attachment (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
- After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely use a technique to execute commands or scripts to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
- Among the given options, T1059.001-PowerShell (using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts) is the most plausible technique that would follow the initial access.

### Final Answer: D
