Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Defense evasion techniques are used, specifically self-deletion on a hardcoded date.
2. The malware then collects detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion**: T1070.004-File Deletion (self-deletion on a hardcoded date)
- **Discovery**: T1082-System Information Discovery (collecting detailed information about system properties)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the collection of system information. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.
- **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the part of the question where the malware collects detailed information about system properties.
- **C: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook, which is not mentioned in the question and does not fit the sequence.
- **D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information from browsers, which is not mentioned in the question and does not fit the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first uses defense evasion techniques (self-deletion) and then collects system information.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1082-System Information Discovery is the technique used for collecting system information.
- None of the other techniques (T1070-Indicator Removal, T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook, T1217-Browser Information Discovery) fit the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
