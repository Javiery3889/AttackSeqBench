Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs for the Darkhotel APT's attack flow. Specifically, it mentions that the APT gained initial access through malware disguised as legitimate software updates after compromising trusted commercial network resources globally. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred prior to this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains**: This suggests that the APT developed and used domains for their operations.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This indicates that the APT used drive-by compromise to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This suggests that the APT compromised the software supply chain to deliver malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence:

- **A: T1546.016-Installer Packages**: This technique involves using installer packages to deploy malware. While it is related to the final step of delivering malware, it does not directly precede the initial access.
- **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities for the APT. While it is a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly precede the initial access.
- **C: T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves establishing a trusted relationship to facilitate the attack. This could be a precursor to gaining initial access, as it helps in gaining the trust of the target.
- **D: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves using domains for command and control (C2) or other purposes. While it is related to the overall attack, it does not directly precede the initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the APT gained initial access through malware disguised as legitimate software updates after compromising trusted commercial network resources globally.
- The related TTPs suggest that the APT used a compromised software supply chain (T1195.002) to deliver malware.
- Establishing a trusted relationship (T1199) would be a logical step to gain the trust of the target, which would then facilitate the compromise of trusted commercial network resources and the subsequent initial access.

### Final Answer: C: T1199-Trusted Relationship
