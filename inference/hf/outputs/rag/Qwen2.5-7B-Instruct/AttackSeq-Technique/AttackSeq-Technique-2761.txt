Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where SOCKSBOT implant used defense evasion methods, specifically reflective loading in memory via svchost.exe, to avoid disk artifacts. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial step.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique aligns with the use of reflective loading in memory via svchost.exe.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process, which is a form of process injection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique also involves injecting code into a process, which is consistent with the reflective loading via svchost.exe.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is related to using application layer protocols for command and control, which does not directly follow the reflective loading in memory.
- **B: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography, which is not directly related to the reflective loading or process injection described.
- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands, which could be a step after reflective loading if the implant needs to execute further commands.
- **D: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**: This technique involves wiping disk structures, which is not directly related to the reflective loading or process injection described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the implant uses reflective loading in memory via svchost.exe to avoid disk artifacts.
- The related TTPs mention techniques such as T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection and T1055-Process Injection, which are consistent with the reflective loading and process injection.
- The most plausible next step would be to use a command and scripting interpreter to execute further commands, as this would be a logical follow-up to the initial implantation and evasion techniques.

### Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
