Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already leveraged credential access to retrieve data using tools like Mimikatz and procdump. The goal is to gather email data from the victim's systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection** - This is the overarching tactic that encompasses the act of gathering information.
- **Technique: T1114-Email Collection** - This technique specifically involves collecting email data.
- **Tactic: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems.
- **Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory** - This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to retrieve credentials.
- **Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping** - This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1197-BITS Jobs** - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It does not directly relate to email collection.
- **Answer Choice B: T1606.001-Web Cookies** - This technique involves stealing web cookies, which are not directly related to email collection.
- **Answer Choice C: T1114-Email Collection** - This technique directly involves collecting email data, which aligns with the goal of the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not related to email collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the attacker having already obtained credentials using Mimikatz and procdump, which are techniques under the Tactic of Credential Access.
- The goal is to gather email data, which is directly addressed by the T1114-Email Collection technique.
- The related TTPs confirm that the Tactic of Collection is relevant, and T1114-Email Collection is the specific technique for gathering email data.

### Final Answer: C: T1114-Email Collection
