### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a dropper, process hollowing on `msiexec.exe`, and ensuring a malicious file (`ssonsvr.exe` or `srvcl32.dll`) loads during the next system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1590.006-Network Security Appliances:** This technique is not directly related to ensuring persistence or loading a file during system startup. It is more about using network security appliances to evade detection.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique directly addresses ensuring a file loads during the next system startup, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence, but it is not specifically about ensuring a file loads during the next system startup.
   - **T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials:** This technique is about obtaining additional cloud credentials, which is not relevant to the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to ensure the malicious file loads during the next system startup is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

### Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
