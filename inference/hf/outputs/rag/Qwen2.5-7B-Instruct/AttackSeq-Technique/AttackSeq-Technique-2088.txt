Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Carbanak conducted reconnaissance by collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures. This is followed by the downloading and execution of new payloads to move laterally in the infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally within the network, which aligns with the later phase of moving laterally.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware to the target. It does not directly align with the described sequence of collecting data and moving laterally.
- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware. While it can be part of the initial reconnaissance, it does not directly align with the described sequence of collecting data and moving laterally.
- **Answer Choice C: T1584.005-Botnet**
  - This technique involves using a botnet to spread malware. It does not directly align with the described sequence of collecting data and moving laterally.
- **Answer Choice D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which can be part of the process of moving laterally after collecting data. However, it is more likely to occur after the initial data collection phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial phase involves collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures, which aligns with T1590-Gather Victim Network Information.
- The next phase involves moving laterally within the infrastructure, which aligns with T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
- The technique that most likely occurred after the initial data collection and before moving laterally is T1003-OS Credential Dumping, as it involves obtaining credentials that can be used to move laterally.

### Final Answer: D
