Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10:
1. Staged data for exfiltration.
2. Used multi-part archives with compression tools.
3. Launched these via remote command execution scripts.
4. Leveraged shared MSP infrastructure for data transfer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique involves archiving data using utilities.
- **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data remotely.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
- This technique involves duplicating network traffic to evade detection. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.

**B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
- This technique involves archiving data, which aligns with the use of multi-part archives and compression tools. However, it does not specifically mention the remote execution or data transfer part.

**C: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**
- This technique involves creating processes that mimic legitimate ones to evade detection. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.

**D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
- This technique involves exfiltrating data over protocols that are not the primary ones used by the target. While it aligns with the data transfer part, it does not cover the staging and archiving part.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes staging data, archiving it, and then transferring it over a remote infrastructure.
- **T1560.001-Archive via Utility** (related TTP) aligns with the use of multi-part archives and compression tools.
- **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging** (related TTP) aligns with the remote execution and data transfer part.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. **T1560.001-Archive via Utility** (staging and archiving data)
2. **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging** (remote execution and data transfer)

However, the question asks for a single technique that most likely occurred after the described actions. The closest match to the described sequence is **T1560.001-Archive via Utility** as it directly aligns with the archiving part of the sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
