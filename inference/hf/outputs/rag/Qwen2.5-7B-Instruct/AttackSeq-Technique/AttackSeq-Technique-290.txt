Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Encoded blobs are used to evade detection through PowerShell command line scripts.
2. Additional malware is downloaded.
3. Elephant's file-stealer module begins collecting specific file types for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using malicious emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the use of PowerShell scripts or downloading additional malware.
  
- **B: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
  - This technique involves accessing the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to obtain credentials. While it can be used for credential theft, it does not directly relate to the use of PowerShell scripts or downloading additional malware.
  
- **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password managers or other password storage mechanisms. It can be used for credential theft but does not directly relate to the use of PowerShell scripts or downloading additional malware.
  
- **D: T1495-Firmware Corruption**
  - This technique involves corrupting firmware to gain persistence or maintain access. It does not directly relate to the use of PowerShell scripts or downloading additional malware.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. The technique that best fits this context is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**, which is related to the command and control tactic and involves transferring tools to the target system.

The technique **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** is also relevant as it involves decoding the PowerShell scripts used for evasion.

However, the question asks which technique most likely occurred before the Elephant's file-stealer module began collecting specific file types for exfiltration. Given the options, the most relevant technique is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: D**
