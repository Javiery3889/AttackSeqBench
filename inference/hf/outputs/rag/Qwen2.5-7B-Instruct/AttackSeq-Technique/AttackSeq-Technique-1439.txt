### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where ProjectM actors first obtain initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks using malicious RTF and Excel files.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely employed during the preparation steps to identify Indian government and military personnel as targets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and techniques such as "T1189-Drive-by Compromise" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - These TTPs are related to the initial steps of the attack, but they do not directly address the preparation phase for identifying targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**
     - This technique is related to loading dynamic libraries, which is not directly related to identifying targets.
   - **Option B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about potential victims, which aligns with the need to identify specific targets such as Indian government and military personnel.
   - **Option C: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
     - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which could be part of reconnaissance but is not specifically about gathering information on specific individuals.
   - **Option D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system, which is more about the post-exploitation phase rather than the preparation phase for identifying targets.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for identifying Indian government and military personnel as targets during the preparation phase is **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**.

**Final Answer: B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
