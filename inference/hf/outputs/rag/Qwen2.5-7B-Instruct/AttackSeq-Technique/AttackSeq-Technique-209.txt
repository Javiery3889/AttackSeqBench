Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where SparrowDoor gathers system information (usernames, RDP session IDs, and file attributes) during the Discovery phase. The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel using SparrowDoor. We need to identify the technique that occurs between Discovery and Exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration
- Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

This indicates that the exfiltration process involves using a C&C channel, which aligns with the use of SparrowDoor for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking a user's browser session. It does not directly relate to the data gathering or exfiltration process described in the question.
  
- **B: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves accessing data from the local system. Given that SparrowDoor has already gathered system information, this technique seems to be a plausible candidate for the next step before exfiltration.
  
- **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While this could be a step in the process, it is more likely to occur after data has been gathered and before exfiltration to ensure the data is not easily detected.
  
- **D: T1213.001-Confluence**
  - This technique involves using Confluence for data exfiltration. However, the question specifies that the exfiltration is done over a C&C channel using SparrowDoor, not Confluence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence involves gathering system information (Discovery phase) and then exfiltrating the data over a C&C channel (Exfiltration phase).
- The technique that logically fits between Discovery and Exfiltration is one that involves accessing and possibly preparing the data for exfiltration.
- T1005-Data from Local System is the most relevant technique as it directly involves accessing data from the local system, which aligns with the data gathering phase.

### Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System
