Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ChromeLoader used a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic for C2.
2. Gimmick leveraged cloud hosting services like Google Drive for C2 communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service**
  - T1102-Web Service involves using a web service for command and control. This aligns with the use of cloud hosting services like Google Drive for C2 communication (Gimmick leveraging cloud hosting services).
  - However, T1102-Web Service does not directly describe the use of a listener to intercept traffic, which is a key part of the sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - T1195-Supply Chain Compromise involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware. This does not directly align with the use of a listener to intercept traffic or cloud hosting services for C2 communication.

- **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding involves encoding data to evade detection. This does not directly align with the use of a listener to intercept traffic or cloud hosting services for C2 communication.

- **Answer Choice D: T1204.002-Malicious File**
  - T1204.002-Malicious File involves delivering a malicious file. This does not directly align with the use of a listener to intercept traffic or cloud hosting services for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence involving a listener to intercept traffic and cloud hosting services for C2 communication.
- T1102-Web Service (Choice A) is the closest match to the use of cloud hosting services for C2 communication.
- However, T1102-Web Service does not directly describe the use of a listener to intercept traffic, which is a key part of the sequence.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is best described by T1102-Web Service, as it aligns with the use of cloud hosting services for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: T1102-Web Service**
