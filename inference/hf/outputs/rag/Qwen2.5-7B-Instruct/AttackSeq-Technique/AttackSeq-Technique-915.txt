Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the initial technique that enabled access to the vulnerable systems before the Tuyul botnet executed commands. The TTPs mentioned are related to lateral movement and execution, which are part of the Tuyul botnet's attack sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves using a service or application to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell**: This technique involves using a Unix shell to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be a method to gain initial access, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access. It is more aligned with the related TTPs, especially T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
- **Answer Choice C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique is not directly related to the related TTPs and does not fit the context of gaining access to systems.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it is related to execution, it is not the initial technique that enables access to the systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs mention techniques related to exploiting remote services (T1210) and using remote services to gain access (T1133).
- The question asks for the technique that enables access to the systems before executing commands.
- T1133-External Remote Services (Answer Choice B) is the most plausible technique as it directly aligns with the related TTPs and the context of gaining access to the systems.

### Final Answer: B
