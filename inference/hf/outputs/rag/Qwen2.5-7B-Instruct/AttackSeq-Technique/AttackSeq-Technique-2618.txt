Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where sensitive information is collected from victims' devices and then transmitted back to the attackers' infrastructure via HTTP POST requests. The key points are:
- Sensitive information is collected (contact lists, geo-locations, voice recordings).
- The data is transmitted back to the attackers' infrastructure.
- The transmission method is HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the exfiltration tactic:
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves communication that can go in both directions. However, the question specifically mentions data being transmitted back to the attackers' infrastructure, which suggests a one-way communication. Therefore, this choice is less likely.
  
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for data exfiltration. HTTP POST requests are an application layer protocol, which aligns well with the described transmission method. This choice is a strong candidate.

- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to exfiltrate data. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the method of data transmission (HTTP POST requests). Therefore, this choice is less relevant.

- **D: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves rapidly changing DNS records to evade detection. It is not directly related to the described data transmission method (HTTP POST requests). Therefore, this choice is less relevant.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes data being transmitted back to the attackers' infrastructure via HTTP POST requests.
- The related TTPs mention automated exfiltration and exfiltration over a C2 channel.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B) is the most relevant because it directly describes the use of an application layer protocol (HTTP POST) for data exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
