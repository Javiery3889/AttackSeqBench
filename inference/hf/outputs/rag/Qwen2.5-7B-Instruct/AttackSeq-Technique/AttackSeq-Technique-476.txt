### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Trickbot gained initial access to a victim's system via a spearphishing attachment (a Microsoft Word document with an enabled macro).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the scenario of a Word document with an enabled macro.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique describes the use of a spearphishing attachment to gain initial access, which is directly relevant to the scenario.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it could be a step in the attack chain, it does not directly follow the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.
   - **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute code. This could be a step after gaining initial access, but it is not the immediate next step after the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.
   - **C: T1609-Container Administration Command** - This technique involves administrative commands for container management. It is not directly related to the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. This is a step that could follow gaining initial access, but it is not the immediate next step after the initial access via a spearphishing attachment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the immediate next step after gaining initial access via a spearphishing attachment. The technique that best fits this description is the execution of a malicious file, which is directly related to the scenario.
   - **Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
