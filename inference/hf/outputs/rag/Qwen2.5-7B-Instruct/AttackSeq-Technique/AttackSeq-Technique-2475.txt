### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where legitimate applications are used to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** - This is the overarching tactic that encompasses the collection of credentials.
   - **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers** - This technique specifically targets credentials from web browsers.
   - **Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule** - This technique involves setting up rules to forward emails, which can be used to collect credentials from mail clients.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves running code at system boot or logon. It does not directly relate to collecting credentials from mail clients or browsers.
   - **B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking dynamic link libraries. It is not directly related to collecting credentials from mail clients or browsers.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** - This technique involves stealing credentials from password managers or other password storage mechanisms. While it is related to credential access, it does not specifically mention mail clients or browsers.
   - **D: T1552.003-Bash History** - This technique involves using the bash history to retrieve previously entered commands, which could potentially include credentials. However, it is not directly related to mail clients or browsers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers** and **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**. However, among the given answer choices, the one that best fits the context of collecting credentials from both mail clients and browsers is **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**. Although it does not explicitly mention mail clients, it is the closest match to the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer: C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
