### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a second-stage downloader is executed via a malicious macro.
   - After this, Lokibot uses a 'fileless' UAC bypass technique to escalate privileges.
   - We need to determine which technique most likely occurred before the UAC bypass.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Privilege Escalation" and specifically reference "T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control" as a technique for privilege escalation.
   - This indicates that the UAC bypass technique is a key part of the sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into a legitimate process to execute arbitrary code. It does not directly relate to privilege escalation or UAC bypass.
   - **B: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**
     - This technique involves using social media accounts to spread malware or perform other malicious activities. It does not directly relate to privilege escalation or UAC bypass.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It does not directly relate to privilege escalation or UAC bypass.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it is more about code execution rather than directly bypassing UAC.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the UAC bypass technique (T1548.002) is a key part of the sequence, we need a technique that would logically precede it.
   - **T1055-Process Injection (D)** is the most plausible choice because it can be used to inject code that then performs the UAC bypass. This is a common sequence in malware operations where a process is first injected with malicious code, which then performs the UAC bypass to escalate privileges.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
