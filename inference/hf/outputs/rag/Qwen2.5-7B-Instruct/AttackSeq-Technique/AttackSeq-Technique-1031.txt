### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Kingslayer uses a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion and deploys it using a stolen code signing private key.
   - The key elements are:
     - Defense Evasion
     - Code signing
     - Deployment into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique involves using a stolen code signing certificate to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate.
   - **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves using time-based evasion to avoid detection, which aligns with the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. While it can be a method of deployment, it does not directly relate to the use of code signing or the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This is a broader term for compromising the supply chain, which can include hardware and software. However, it is less specific to the code signing aspect.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021.005-VNC**
     - This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access. It does not align with the use of code signing or the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves using remote access software, which can be a method of deployment but does not directly relate to the use of code signing or the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of using a stolen code signing private key for deployment, is **T1553.002-Code Signing**.
   - This technique directly aligns with the use of a stolen code signing private key to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate and facilitating its deployment into enterprise environments.

**Final Answer: A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain** (Note: The correct answer should be T1553.002-Code Signing, but based on the provided choices and the context, the closest match is A, as B is a broader term and C and D do not align with the code signing aspect.)
