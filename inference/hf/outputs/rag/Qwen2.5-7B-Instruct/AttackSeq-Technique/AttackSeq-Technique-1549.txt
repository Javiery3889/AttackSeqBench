### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that APT42 used application layer protocols and encrypted channels to maintain communication with compromised systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial communication setup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the techniques include:
     - T1071-Application Layer Protocol (already mentioned in the question)
     - T1573-Encrypted Channel (also mentioned in the question)
     - T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution** - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to IP addresses. It is not directly related to maintaining communication via application layer protocols and encrypted channels.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using web services for command and control. While it is related to web services, it does not directly follow the use of application layer protocols and encrypted channels.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities** - This technique involves developing new capabilities or modifying existing ones. It is not directly related to maintaining communication.
   - **D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature** - This technique involves using invalid code signatures to evade detection. It is not directly related to maintaining communication via application layer protocols and encrypted channels.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of maintaining communication via application layer protocols and encrypted channels, the most plausible next step would be to ensure that the communication remains undetected and continues to function effectively.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service** is the most plausible choice because it involves using web services for command and control, which can be a method to maintain communication after the initial setup using application layer protocols and encrypted channels.

### Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
