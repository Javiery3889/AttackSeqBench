### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware has already employed defense evasion methods such as debugging checks, process name hashing, and timestomping.
   - The sequence is followed by communication with external C2 IP addresses on port 443.
   - We need to identify the technique that occurs after these defense evasion methods but before the C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" as the tactic and "T1497.003-Time Based Evasion" as the technique.
   - This suggests that the sequence involves time-based evasion techniques, which could be part of the defense evasion methods mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by debuggers, which is one of the defense evasion methods mentioned in the question.
     - It is likely to occur before the communication with C2, as it is a method to avoid detection.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which is not directly related to the defense evasion methods mentioned.
     - It is less likely to be the next step in the sequence.
   - **C: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**
     - This technique involves creating a Golden Ticket to gain unauthorized access to network resources.
     - It is more likely to be a step after the initial infection and before C2 communication, but it is not directly related to the defense evasion methods.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering running processes on a system.
     - It is more likely to be a step after the initial infection and before C2 communication, but it is not directly related to the defense evasion methods.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, is that the malware would first employ debugging checks, process name hashing, and timestomping (defense evasion methods), and then use T1622-Debugger Evasion to further evade detection before communicating with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after the mentioned defense evasion methods but before the C2 communication is T1622-Debugger Evasion.

**Final Answer: A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
