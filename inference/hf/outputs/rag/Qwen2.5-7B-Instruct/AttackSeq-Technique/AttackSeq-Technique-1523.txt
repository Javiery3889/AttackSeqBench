Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gaining initial access by modifying a JavaScript file on a CDN server.
2. Evading detection using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1027.002-Software Packing**: This technique involves packing or obfuscating files to evade detection.
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make them harder to detect or understand.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**: This technique involves downgrading the security of a system or application. It does not directly relate to the described actions of modifying a JavaScript file or evading detection through packing.
- **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It does not directly relate to the described actions of modifying a JavaScript file or evading detection through packing.
- **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website or drive-by download. While it can be a method of gaining initial access, it does not directly relate to the described actions of modifying a JavaScript file or evading detection through packing.
- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique directly relates to the described action of evading detection by obfuscating files or information. The question mentions using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding, which is a form of obfuscation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes gaining initial access by modifying a JavaScript file and then evading detection using packing and obfuscation.
- The related TTPs mention T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information, which aligns with the described actions of evading detection through packing and obfuscation.
- None of the other TTPs (Downgrade Attack, ARP Cache Poisoning, or Drive-by Compromise) directly relate to the described actions of modifying a JavaScript file and evading detection through packing.

### Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
