Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs following the initial access via a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6. After the installation process, a second service is registered pointing to a backdoor DLL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This is the initial step where the adversary gains access to the target system.
- **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.

- **Tactic: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target system over time.
- **Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service** - This technique involves creating a Windows service to maintain persistence, which aligns with the registration of a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1059.011-Lua** - This technique involves using Lua to execute code. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly relate to the registration of a Windows service, which is the focus of the question.
- **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the registration of a service.
- **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services** - This technique involves modifying system services, which aligns with the registration of a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.
- **Answer Choice D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares** - This technique involves using SMB or Windows admin shares to move laterally or gain access, which is not directly related to the registration of a service.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the registration of a second service pointing to a backdoor DLL, which is a persistence technique.
- The related TTPs mention the technique T1543.003-Windows Service, which directly aligns with the registration of a service.
- Among the answer choices, T1569-System Services (Answer Choice C) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the registration of a service.

### Final Answer: C
