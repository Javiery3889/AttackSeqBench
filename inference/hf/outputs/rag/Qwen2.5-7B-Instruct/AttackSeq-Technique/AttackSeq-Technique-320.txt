### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where encrypted data is collected from compromised systems, managed through a web application, and then uploaded to C&C servers for archiving.
   - The focus is on the action of uploading the stolen data to the C&C servers and archiving it for operator access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves storing or archiving the collected data for later use.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C&C) channel. While this is related to data transfer, it does not specifically address the archiving of data.
   - **B: T1546.001-Change Default File Association:** This technique involves changing the default file association to execute malicious code. It is not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data, which is the opposite of what is described in the question (archiving data).
   - **D: T1011-Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a network medium other than the primary C2 channel. While it is related to data transfer, it does not specifically address the archiving of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the technique that involves archiving the collected data. The related TTPs suggest that the technique T1560-Archive Collected Data is the most relevant.

### Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

**Note:** Although T1041 is related to data exfiltration, the context of the question and the related TTPs suggest that the most relevant technique is T1560-Archive Collected Data. However, since T1041 is the closest match among the given options and directly involves the transfer of data to the C&C servers, it is the most plausible answer based on the provided choices.
