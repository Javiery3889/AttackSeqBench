Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after gaining domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz, APT15 deployed backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution. We need to identify which TTP occurred before the deployment of these backdoors.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1078.002-Domain Accounts
- **Persistence**: T1078.002-Domain Accounts
- **Reconnaissance**: T1589.001-Credentials

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**
  - This TTP is related to Linux systems, not Windows domain environments. It is less relevant here.

- **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This TTP involves gathering data from various repositories, which is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This TTP directly relates to the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials, which aligns with the question's mention of gaining domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz.

- **D: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**
  - This TTP involves embedding payloads in legitimate files or documents, which is not directly related to the credential dumping or backdoor deployment mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions gaining domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz, which aligns with T1003-OS Credential Dumping.
- The related TTPs mention Initial Access and Persistence, which are consistent with the sequence of actions leading to the deployment of backdoors.
- T1003-OS Credential Dumping is the most direct and relevant TTP that occurred before the deployment of backdoors.

### Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping
