### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - CostaRicto used SSH tools to set up remote tunneling with private key authentication.
   - The next step was using the `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` PowerSploit module for process injection.
   - We need to identify the technique that logically follows the SSH tunneling and precedes the process injection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique is related to the use of private keys, which aligns with the SSH tunneling.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique is directly related to the process injection step mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1609-Container Administration Command:** This technique is not directly related to the SSH tunneling or process injection.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique is about using default accounts, which is not directly related to the SSH tunneling or process injection.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter, which could be part of the process injection but does not directly follow the SSH tunneling.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves setting up a tunnel, which aligns with the SSH tunneling. It is a logical step before the process injection.

### Final Answer:
The technique that most likely occurred after the SSH tunneling and before the process injection is **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**.

Final Answer: D
