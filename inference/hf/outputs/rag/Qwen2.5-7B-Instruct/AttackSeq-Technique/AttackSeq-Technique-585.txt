Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Threat actors used AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools.
2. They dumped credentials using Mimikatz.
3. They used Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems in the network.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after using the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems in the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided TTPs:

- **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying and enumerating user accounts and their attributes. While it can be part of the credential access tactic, it doesn't directly follow the use of Impacket atexec to run commands on other systems.

- **B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
  - This technique involves using administrative shares to gain access to files or execute commands. This could be a plausible technique to run commands on other systems after using Impacket atexec, as it leverages existing administrative shares.

- **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate to a system, such as using stolen credentials. While it is part of the credential access tactic, it doesn't directly follow the use of Impacket atexec to run commands on other systems.

- **D: T1137-Office Application Startup**
  - This technique involves using office applications to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to running commands on other systems via Impacket atexec.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where threat actors use Impacket atexec to run commands on other systems. This implies that the next step would be to leverage the administrative access gained to perform actions on those systems.
- Among the given options, T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares (B) is the most plausible technique to follow the use of Impacket atexec. It directly relates to leveraging administrative shares to run commands on other systems, which is a common follow-up action after gaining access via Impacket.

### Final Answer: B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares
