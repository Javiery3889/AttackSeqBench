Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that Scote malware used legitimate third-party online services for hosting its C2 (Command and Control) information to evade detection. This implies that the malware is trying to establish a covert communication channel that is less likely to be detected by traditional security measures.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** T1102-Web Service

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system. While it is a common initial access technique, the question specifically mentions the use of legitimate third-party online services for C2, which is more aligned with the Command and Control tactic.
  
- **Option B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While this can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the use of third-party online services for C2.

- **Option C: T1590.002-DNS**
  - This technique involves using DNS for C2. While DNS can be used for C2, the question specifically mentions the use of third-party online services, which is more aligned with web services.

- **Option D: T1036.007-Double File Extension**
  - This technique involves using double file extensions to evade detection. Similar to the other options, this is a technique that can be used but does not directly address the use of third-party online services for C2.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question emphasizes the use of legitimate third-party online services for C2, which is directly related to the T1102-Web Service technique.
- The T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service technique is part of the Initial Access tactic and is used to gain initial access, which is a prerequisite for establishing C2.
- The sequence of TTPs would logically be: Initial Access (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service) followed by Command and Control (T1102-Web Service).

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: C: T1590.002-DNS (Note: This is a misinterpretation in the options provided. The correct answer should be T1102-Web Service, but since it is not listed, the closest related TTP is DNS, which is used for C2 communication.)

However, if the correct TTP for web service C2 is available, the answer should be T1102-Web Service.
