### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a PowerShell script communicates with C2 domains to download malware and manage data exchanges.
   - The next step in the sequence is to hinder static analysis through file obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Defense Evasion" tactics and specifically "Obfuscated Files or Information" and "Command Obfuscation" techniques.
   - This indicates that the focus is on techniques that make the malware or its commands difficult to analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547.010-Port Monitors**
     - This technique involves monitoring network ports to detect and prevent unauthorized access. It does not directly relate to file obfuscation or hindering static analysis.
   - **B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**
     - This technique involves using ptrace system calls to monitor and control the execution of processes. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not directly relate to file obfuscation.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves removing obfuscation from files or information. The question is about hindering static analysis through file obfuscation, which is the opposite of deobfuscation.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or analyze by using obfuscation. This directly aligns with the question's requirement to hinder static analysis through file obfuscation.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
