Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Moving laterally within the network using compromised credentials.
2. Identifying servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.
3. Exfiltrating this intellectual property to remote locations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves the attacker staging data on a remote system for later exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1074-Data Staged**: This technique is not listed in the related TTPs, and the question does not mention staging data on a remote system.
- **Answer Choice B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or commands on a user's system. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
- **Answer Choice C: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**: This technique involves using the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) driver to extract credentials. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
- **Answer Choice D: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data on a remote system, which is a logical step before exfiltrating the data. It aligns well with the described sequence of actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes moving laterally and identifying servers hosting sensitive intellectual property, which aligns with the collection tactic.
- The next step is to stage the data on a remote system, which is a logical precursor to exfiltration. This aligns with the T1074.002-Remote Data Staging technique.
- Finally, the data is exfiltrated to remote locations, which aligns with the exfiltration tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: D
