### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Infamous Chisel persisted on the system by replacing the legitimate `netd` binary at the path `/system/bin/netd`, allowing it to execute as root.
   - This indicates that the persistence mechanism involves modifying a critical system binary to ensure the malware can run with elevated privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves making malware appear as legitimate software to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary:** This technique involves modifying or replacing legitimate software to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1037.004-RC Scripts:** This technique involves using resource scripts to maintain persistence, but it is less relevant to the specific binary replacement mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**
     - This technique involves adding local or domain groups to gain additional privileges. While it can be part of an overall attack, it does not directly relate to the specific binary replacement mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1554-Compromise Client Software Binary**
     - This technique directly involves modifying or replacing legitimate software to maintain persistence, which aligns closely with the question's description of replacing the `netd` binary.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**
     - This technique involves stealing Kerberos tickets, which is not directly related to the binary replacement described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying software on the system, which is a precursor to modifying it but does not directly address the binary replacement.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker first compromised a host software binary (T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary) to replace the `netd` binary, allowing it to persist and execute as root.

**Final Answer: B**
