Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Staging data from network shared drives.
2. Archiving the data with specific utilities.
3. Enabling the transfer of tools and communication within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves collecting data from remote systems, which aligns with the first part of the sequence (staging data from network shared drives).
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves moving tools or other malicious content to other systems within the network, which aligns with the third part of the sequence (enabling the transfer of tools and communication within the network).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **Answer Choice B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**: This technique involves adding a loadable code library to a binary, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **Answer Choice C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection, which could be part of the lateral movement but does not directly address the data staging and archiving part.
- **Answer Choice D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding infrastructure to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves collecting data from network shared drives (T1074.002-Remote Data Staging) and then transferring tools and communication within the network (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer).
- The technique that best fits the third part of the sequence (enabling the transfer of tools and communication within the network) is T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.

### Final Answer: D
