### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where employees enable macros in weaponized phishing email attachments, which leads to the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware on workstations.
   - The key TTPs involved are spearphishing attachments (T1566.001) and the execution of malicious files (T1204.002).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves the adversary using a spearphishing email with a weaponized attachment to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which in this case is the BlackEnergy 3 malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1569.001-Launchctl** - This technique involves the use of the `launchd` and `launchctl` utilities to manage and execute processes. It is not directly related to the initial spearphishing attack or the execution of a malicious file.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to execute code. It is not directly related to the initial spearphishing attack or the execution of a malicious file.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1018-Remote System Discovery** - This technique involves the discovery of remote systems, which is not directly related to the initial spearphishing attack or the execution of a malicious file.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves the execution of code or applications by a user. In the context of the question, this aligns with the employees enabling macros in the weaponized phishing email attachments, which then leads to the execution of the BlackEnergy 3 malware.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
