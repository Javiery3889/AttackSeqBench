Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Utilizing GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
2. Performing discovery to lure victims with decoy documents and cloned websites.
3. Harvesting access credentials from central Indian government employees using SideCopy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials from various sources.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves collecting data automatically.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing links to gather information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves monitoring keystrokes to capture passwords and other sensitive information. While it could be used to harvest credentials, it is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
- **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves extracting credentials from password managers or other password storage systems. While it could be relevant, it does not directly align with the described sequence of actions.
- **C: T1110.001-Password Guessing**: This technique involves attempting to guess passwords. It is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
- **D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's organization. While it is part of the reconnaissance phase, it does not directly align with the described sequence of actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves exfiltrating authentication databases, performing discovery, and then harvesting credentials.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for gathering credentials and automated collection, which align more closely with the described sequence.
- **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** (Choice B) is the most relevant technique because it directly involves harvesting credentials, which is the final step in the described sequence.

### Final Answer: B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
