### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence by Venomous Bear, where the NewPass loader decodes a configuration file and extracts an agent component.
   - The goal is to identify the technique that enables stealthy communication with the command-and-control (C2) server after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Defense Evasion," which aligns with the need for stealthy communication.
   - The technique mentioned is "Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information," which is relevant to the decoding of the configuration file by the NewPass loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server, which can provide stealth by making the communication difficult to detect.
   - **B: T1027.003-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other data, which could be used to encode or obfuscate the communication, but it is more about hiding data rather than providing a direct channel for communication.
   - **C: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
     - This technique involves using DNS queries to exfiltrate data, which is more about data exfiltration rather than establishing a stealthy communication channel.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is more about the actual data transfer rather than the establishment of a stealthy communication channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the need for stealthy communication and the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible technique is T1573-Encrypted Channel, as it directly addresses the need for a stealthy communication channel with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
