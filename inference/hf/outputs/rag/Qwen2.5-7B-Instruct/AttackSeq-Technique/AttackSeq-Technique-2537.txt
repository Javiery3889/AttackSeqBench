Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Fake Japanese documents are used to gain initial access.
2. Malware retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which could be the malware that retrieves the C&C configuration.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** - This technique involves using a dead drop (a method of communication where information is left in a hidden location) to retrieve C&C information.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding information, which could be necessary to retrieve the encrypted C&C configuration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1497.001-System Checks** - This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in a state that allows for the execution of the malware. However, it does not directly relate to the retrieval of C&C configuration information.
- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring the malware starts automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly relate to the retrieval of C&C configuration information.
- **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts** - This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts. This is not directly related to the retrieval of C&C configuration information.
- **D: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the C&C server. This aligns well with the retrieval of C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs, which are web-based services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained using fake Japanese documents.
- The malware then needs to retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.
- The most relevant TTP for retrieving information from web-based services is T1102-Web Service.

### Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service
