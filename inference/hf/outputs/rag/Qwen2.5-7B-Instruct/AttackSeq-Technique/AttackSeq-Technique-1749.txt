Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Employing PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance.
2. Leveraging compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB.
3. Lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique involves using cloud accounts for lateral movement, which does not align with the described actions (SMB/Windows Admin Shares and tool transfer).
- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to the described lateral movement actions.
- **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services for lateral movement, which is close but not specific to the SMB/Windows Admin Shares mentioned.
- **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement, which does not align with the described actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes using SMB/Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, which aligns with **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**.
- The related TTPs mention **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares** as a specific technique for lateral movement within a network.

### Final Answer: C: T1021.007-Cloud Services

However, upon re-evaluation, the correct answer should be **C: T1021-Remote Services** or more specifically **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**. Since the exact TTP is not listed, the closest and most plausible answer based on the provided choices is:

Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
