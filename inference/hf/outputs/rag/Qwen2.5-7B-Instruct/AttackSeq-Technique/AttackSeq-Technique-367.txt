### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where system fingerprinting is conducted using `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.
   - The next step in the sequence is domain trust discovery using `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the trust relationships between domains.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which can include system fingerprinting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1069.001-Local Groups**
     - This technique involves gathering information about local groups on a system. While it is related to system information, it does not directly align with the domain trust discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves gathering information about digital certificates. It is not directly related to the domain trust discovery or system fingerprinting.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is more about altering or bypassing security controls rather than gathering information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user, which can include system fingerprinting. However, it does not directly align with the domain trust discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of system fingerprinting followed by domain trust discovery, is that the system fingerprinting (using `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`) is a precursor to the domain trust discovery (using `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`).
   - The technique that best fits the step before domain trust discovery is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**, which involves gathering information about remote systems, including system fingerprinting.

### Final Answer: D
