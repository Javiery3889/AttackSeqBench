Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely secures communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server after the Delphi downloader has gathered system information and sent it to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary channel is detected or blocked.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption to secure communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning networks or systems for vulnerabilities. It does not directly relate to securing communication.
- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to secure communication. While it is related to securing communication, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **C: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for command and control. It is related to web protocols (T1071.001) but does not directly secure the communication.
- **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process. It does not directly relate to securing communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols** and **T1008-Fallback Channels** are related to securing communication, but they do not directly mention encryption.
- **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** is explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs and directly addresses securing communication.

Given the context of securing communication and the explicit mention of symmetric cryptography in the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
