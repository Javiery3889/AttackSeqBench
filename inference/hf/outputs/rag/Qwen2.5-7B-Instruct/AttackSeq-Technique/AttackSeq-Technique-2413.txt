Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events:
1. A phishing email with a malicious XLS attachment.
2. Users enabling macros in the attachment.
3. Download and installation of a second-stage downloader for Lokibot.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the malicious XLS attachment.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves the use of a spearphishing attachment to gain initial access to a system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices aligns best with the sequence of events described in the question.

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly follow the download and installation of a second-stage downloader.
- **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to execute it. This is a more advanced technique and doesn't directly follow the download and installation of a second-stage downloader.
- **C: T1543.005-Container Service**: This technique involves using container services to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to the download and installation of a second-stage downloader.
- **D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run malicious code at a later time. This could be a plausible step after the download and installation of a second-stage downloader, as it would allow the malware to run at a later time.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The phishing email with a malicious XLS attachment (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) leads to the execution of the malicious file (T1204.002-Malicious File).
- Enabling macros in the attachment likely leads to the execution of the malicious code, which then downloads and installs the second-stage downloader for Lokibot.
- The most plausible next step would be to create a scheduled task (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) to ensure the second-stage downloader runs at a later time, providing persistence and allowing the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system.

### Final Answer: D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task
