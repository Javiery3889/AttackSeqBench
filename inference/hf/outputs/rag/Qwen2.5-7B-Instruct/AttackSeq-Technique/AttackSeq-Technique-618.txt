Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. An obfuscated VBS script is executed using `wscript.exe`.
2. Post-execution, the script deletes itself to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection.
  - **Technique: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This technique involves renaming system utilities to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the TTP that best fits the sequence described in the question.

- **Option A: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique is about using web services to exfiltrate data or perform other actions. It does not fit the sequence of executing a script and deleting it.
  
- **Option B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - This technique involves using multiple identities to blend in with legitimate users. It does not fit the sequence of executing a script and deleting it.
  
- **Option C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**
  - This technique involves reopening applications to maintain persistence. It does not fit the sequence of executing a script and deleting it.
  
- **Option D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it is related to defense evasion, it does not specifically address the deletion of the script post-execution.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP is **T1070.004-File Deletion** because it directly addresses the action of deleting the script post-execution to evade detection.

**Final Answer: D**
