Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Babar's implant:
1. Reduces forensic artifacts by executing a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from the disk.
2. Steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the TTP that best fits the sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
  - This TTP involves communication between processes, which does not directly relate to the actions of deleting a file or stealing data.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1021.004-SSH**
  - This TTP involves using SSH for remote access, which is not directly related to the actions of deleting a file or stealing data.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This TTP involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it is related to defense evasion, it does not directly match the action of deleting a file.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**
  - This TTP involves modifying cloud compute configurations, which is not directly related to the actions of deleting a file or stealing data.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence
The question specifically mentions that the implant reduces forensic artifacts by deleting the dropper binary. The related TTPs include T1070.004-File Deletion, which directly matches the action of deleting a file.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes the action of deleting a file, which is T1070.004-File Deletion.

### Final Answer: 
Final Answer: C (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) is not the best fit, but the closest related TTP to the described action is T1070.004-File Deletion, which is not listed as an answer choice. However, based on the provided choices, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: C
