Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server.
2. The communication is based on the status code of a GET request.
3. The attackers gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Execution**: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- **Defense Evasion**: T1221-Template Injection

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**
- This technique involves manipulating network trust relationships, which does not directly relate to the initial access or exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.

**B: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**
- This technique involves hijacking a compute resource, which is not directly related to the initial access or exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.

**C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
- This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is more related to defense evasion rather than the initial access or exploitation phase.

**D: T1598-Phishing for Information**
- This technique involves using phishing to obtain information, which is not directly related to the initial access or exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word)
- **Execution**: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (executing the exploit to gain access)
- **Defense Evasion**: T1221-Template Injection (injecting templates to evade detection)

The question specifically mentions the initial access and the exploitation of a vulnerability, which aligns with T1190 and T1203.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D
