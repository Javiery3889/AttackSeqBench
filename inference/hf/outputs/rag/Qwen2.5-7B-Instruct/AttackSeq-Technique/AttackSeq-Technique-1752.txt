Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Utilization of custom versions of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
2. Establishing command and control via an inline hook within the IIS request handling process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - T1055-Process Injection
  - T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
- **Defense Evasion**:
  - T1127.001-MSBuild

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique is not directly related to privilege escalation or command and control via an inline hook in IIS. It is more about deploying software, which does not fit the sequence described.

- **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique is about removing indicators of compromise, which is more about defense evasion rather than the sequence of privilege escalation and command and control.

- **C: T1037.002-Login Hook**
  - This technique involves using a login hook to execute code when a user logs in. While it can be used for command and control, it does not directly relate to the initial privilege escalation step.

- **D: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
  - This technique involves tainting shared content, which can be used to establish command and control. However, it does not directly relate to the initial privilege escalation step.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTPs are:
1. **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation** (for privilege escalation)
2. **T1080-Taint Shared Content** (for establishing command and control via an inline hook in IIS)

However, since the question asks for the most likely TTP that occurred after privilege escalation and before establishing command and control, the best fit is:

**Final Answer: D: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
