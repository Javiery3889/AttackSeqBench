Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions leading to the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Specifically, it mentions:
- Command-and-Control (C2) communications with 170.130.55[.]85:443
- Communication with hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided information:

- **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This TTP involves the use of non-standard ports for C2 communications. The question mentions a specific IP address and port (170.130.55[.]85:443). This aligns well with T1571-Non-Standard Port, as it suggests the use of a non-standard port (443 is typically associated with HTTPS, which is standard, but the combination of the IP and port is non-standard).

- **B: T1593.003-Code Repositories**
  - This TTP involves the use of code repositories for the attacker to store and distribute malicious code. There is no mention of code repositories in the question, so this does not align well with the provided information.

- **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This TTP involves the exfiltration of data over an alternative protocol. The question does not mention any data exfiltration, so this does not align well with the provided information.

- **D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
  - This TTP involves the exfiltration of data over a webhook. Similar to T1048, the question does not mention any data exfiltration, so this does not align well with the provided information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes C2 communications, which aligns with the Tactic of Command and Control.
- The specific mention of a non-standard port (443) for C2 communications aligns with T1571-Non-Standard Port.
- The other TTPs (B, C, and D) do not align with the provided information about C2 communications.

### Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port
