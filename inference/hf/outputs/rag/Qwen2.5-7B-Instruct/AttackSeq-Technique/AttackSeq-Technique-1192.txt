Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where malicious payloads are downloaded via nefarious macros. The next step in the sequence is to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique allows for this maintenance of contact.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of malicious files, which aligns with the download of malicious payloads via nefarious macros.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros, which is consistent with the "nefarious macros" mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, which does not directly relate to maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
- **B: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves the use of JavaScript, which is not directly related to the use of VBA macros mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **C: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves the use of remote access software to maintain a persistent presence on the target network. This aligns well with the need to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves the use of phishing to deliver malicious content, which is not directly related to maintaining contact with the infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence involves the execution of malicious payloads via nefarious macros, which aligns with T1059.005-Visual Basic.
- The next step is to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure, which is best described by T1219-Remote Access Software.

**Final Answer: C: T1219-Remote Access Software**
