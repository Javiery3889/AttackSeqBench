Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after T9000 collected and captured sensitive data, the malware needs to communicate with its C2 server using encrypted traffic while navigating through environments with web proxies. This indicates that the malware must use techniques to bypass or navigate through web proxies and establish encrypted communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1090-Proxy: This technique involves the use of proxies to route traffic.
- T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves the use of web protocols to exfiltrate data.
- T1090.002-External Proxy: This technique involves the use of external proxies to route traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves the use of proxies to route traffic, which can help in bypassing web proxies and establishing communication.
  - However, it does not explicitly mention encrypted traffic.

- **Answer Choice B: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - This technique involves the use of keychain storage to store credentials or other sensitive information. It does not relate to communication with a C2 server or encrypted traffic.

- **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves the automated collection of data, which is not directly related to communication with a C2 server or encrypted traffic.

- **Answer Choice D: T1001.001-Junk Data**
  - This technique involves the use of junk data to obfuscate or hide the actual data being exfiltrated. It does not relate to communication with a C2 server or encrypted traffic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question requires a technique that supports encrypted communication and navigation through web proxies.
- T1090-Proxy (Answer Choice A) is the most relevant because it involves the use of proxies, which can help in bypassing web proxies.
- T1090.002-External Proxy is also relevant but is more specific to external proxies, which might not be the best fit for the context of encrypted traffic.
- T1071.001-Web Protocols is related to web protocols but does not specifically address encrypted traffic or proxy navigation.

Given the context and the need for encrypted traffic and proxy navigation, T1090-Proxy (Answer Choice A) is the most plausible choice.

### Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy
