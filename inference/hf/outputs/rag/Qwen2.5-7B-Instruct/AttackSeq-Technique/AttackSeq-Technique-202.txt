Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Remote code execution vulnerabilities were exploited for initial access.
2. The attacker (FamousSparrow) gained execution by running commands.
3. SparrowDoor was installed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Execution**: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- **Lateral Movement**: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
- This technique is about acquiring infrastructure, which is not directly related to the initial exploitation or execution of commands. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.

**B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
- This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for remote code execution. While it is related to remote code execution, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not directly fit the sequence described.

**C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**
- This technique involves using a virtual private server (VPS) for hosting or command and control (C2) infrastructure. It is more about infrastructure and not directly related to the initial exploitation or execution of commands.

**D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
- This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it can be used after gaining execution, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation or execution of commands.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is:
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Execution**: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution

The correct answer choice that fits the sequence is not explicitly listed among the options provided. However, the closest and most relevant technique to the sequence described is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**, which is part of the Execution tactic.

**Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (Although this is not the best fit, it is the closest among the given options, as it is related to post-exploitation activities.)

However, if we were to strictly follow the sequence and the related TTPs, the correct sequence would involve T1190 and T1203, which are not directly listed in the options.
