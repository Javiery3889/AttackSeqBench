### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents and sent via email to other targets within the same organization.
   - The technique in question is related to the initial access phase, as the malicious documents are used to gain entry into the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Attachment."
   - Spearphishing Attachment is a technique where attackers use malicious attachments in emails to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1546.002-Screensaver** - This technique involves using a screensaver to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It does not align with the scenario of sending malicious documents via email.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file or script. While it could be part of the process, it does not directly describe the initial access via email with malicious attachments.
   - **C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model** - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to execute code. It is not directly related to the scenario of sending malicious documents via email.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing** - This technique involves sending malicious documents or links to internal users within the same organization to gain initial access. This aligns well with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing
