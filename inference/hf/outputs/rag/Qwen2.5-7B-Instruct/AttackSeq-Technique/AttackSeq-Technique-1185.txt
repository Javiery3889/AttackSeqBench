Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with malicious macro activation leading to payload execution. The payload involves dropping multiple files (e.g., .VBS script, .inf file, and scriptlet file) that bypass AppLocker through publicly available code.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.003-CMSTP** - This technique involves using CMSTP (Client Message Queue Service) to evade detection. However, this does not directly relate to the dropping of files or bypassing AppLocker.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic** - This technique involves using Visual Basic for scripting and execution, which aligns with the .VBS script mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, it does not directly address the dropping of files or bypassing AppLocker.
- **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to run malicious code. While this could be a follow-up step, it does not directly address the dropping of files or bypassing AppLocker.
- **C: T1648-Serverless Execution** - This technique involves executing code without a traditional host, which is not directly related to the dropping of files or bypassing AppLocker.
- **D: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal** - This technique involves traversing network address translation to maintain persistence or access. This does not directly address the dropping of files or bypassing AppLocker.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions the dropping of multiple files (e.g., .VBS script, .inf file, and scriptlet file) that bypass AppLocker through publicly available code. This directly aligns with the technique of using Visual Basic for scripting and execution.
- The related TTPs mention T1059.005-Visual Basic, which is the most relevant technique for the described scenario.

### Final Answer: D (T1059.005-Visual Basic)
