Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A PowerShell script decrypted registry contents.
2. The script executed a new script.
3. This led to the establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

- **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique is about using alternative methods to maintain access if the primary method is blocked. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard network protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain access. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described.

- **C: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
  - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography for secure communication. While it could be part of the initial decryption process, it does not directly relate to the execution and establishment of njRAT.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to reduce the size of the malware and evade detection. This could be part of the process of establishing njRAT, as it involves the execution of a new script.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The PowerShell script decrypted the registry contents (related to T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).
2. The script then executed a new script (related to T1059.001-PowerShell).
3. The execution of the new script led to the establishment of njRAT (a remote access tool).

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible TTP that aligns with the establishment of njRAT is the use of shared modules to reduce the size and evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
