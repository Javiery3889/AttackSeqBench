Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe`.
2. Initiating further execution of its payload.
3. Ensuring T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

#### A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
- This technique is about evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to ensuring persistence or autostart execution.
- **Not relevant** to the question.

#### B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities
- This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to ensuring persistence or autostart execution.
- **Not relevant** to the question.

#### C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
- This technique involves ensuring that malware runs or loads with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot. This aligns well with the requirement to ensure T9000's components run or load with every user mode process after a reboot.
- **Highly relevant** to the question.

#### D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process
- This technique involves creating or modifying system processes. While it can be part of a broader persistence strategy, it does not specifically ensure that components run or load with every user mode process after a reboot.
- **Less relevant** compared to T1547.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question requires a technique that ensures T9000's components run or load with every user mode process after a system reboot.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (C) directly addresses this requirement by ensuring that malware runs or loads with every user mode process following a system reboot.
- The related TTPs, T1546.010-AppInit DLLs and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, support the use of DLLs for persistence, which aligns with the initial steps of DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe`.

### Final Answer: C
