### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Rocra attackers infected remote hosts during the lateral movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves compromising a shared resource to spread malware or other malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or malware to a target system to facilitate further lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternative authentication mechanisms to gain access. It is more about gaining initial access rather than facilitating lateral movement.
   - **Option B: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions on services to gain access. It is also more about gaining initial access rather than facilitating lateral movement.
   - **Option C: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves compromising a shared resource to spread malware. This aligns well with the question as it can be a method used to infect remote hosts during lateral movement.
   - **Option D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving network names to IP addresses. While it can be used in lateral movement, it is more about the resolution process rather than the infection itself.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **T1080-Taint Shared Content** (Option C) would most likely occur before the infection of remote hosts during the lateral movement phase. This technique directly supports the spread of malware to remote hosts, which is a key part of the lateral movement phase.

**Final Answer: C**
