Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Spearphishing emails are used to deliver malware.
2. The malware then disrupts analysis by detecting and avoiding virtualized environments.
3. The malware manages Command and Control infrastructure using domains like axroot.com.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: This technique involves detecting and avoiding virtualized environments to evade analysis.
- T1497.001-System Checks: This is a sub-technique of T1497, which involves performing system checks to determine if the environment is a virtualized or sandboxed one.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is about discovering network services, which does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **B: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**: This technique involves downgrading the security posture of a system, which is not directly related to evading virtualized environments.
- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique directly matches the described behavior of detecting and avoiding virtualized environments, which is crucial for disrupting analysis.
- **D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for communication, which is not directly related to evading virtualized environments.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware must detect and avoid virtualized environments to disrupt analysis.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, which is directly related to the described behavior.
- None of the other techniques (T1046, T1562.010, or T1104) align with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
