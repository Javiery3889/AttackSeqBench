Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers:
1. Avoided writing the RAT payload to disk.
2. Connected to a control server associated with the domain "chickenkiller.com".

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to the target system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing malware in memory to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative methods to maintain communication with the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **A: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This technique involves bypassing security controls, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing access, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **C: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation**: This technique involves manipulating the Trust Control Center to bypass security measures, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique aligns with the attackers avoiding writing the RAT payload to disk.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique aligns with the attackers connecting to their control server.

Therefore, the most plausible answer choice is the one that precedes the connection to the control server, which is related to the initial compromise or initial access.

Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing

However, based on the provided related TTPs, the most relevant technique that precedes the connection to the control server is T1027.011-Fileless Storage. Since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before connecting to the control server, and T1027.011-Fileless Storage is not listed as an answer choice, the closest and most plausible answer from the given choices is:

Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
