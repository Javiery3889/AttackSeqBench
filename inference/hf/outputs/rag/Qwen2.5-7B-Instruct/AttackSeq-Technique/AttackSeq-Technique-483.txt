### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
     - Trickbot exhibits anti-analysis characteristics by checking the total number of running processes.
     - This is followed by the use of a point-of-sale (PoS) extraction module to identify PoS-related terms in the targeted domain.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking system properties, which aligns with the anti-analysis characteristic of checking the total number of running processes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and listing running processes, which also aligns with the anti-analysis characteristic of checking the total number of running processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**
     - This technique involves filtering out passwords from password stores. It does not directly relate to the anti-analysis characteristic of checking the number of running processes.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1003.002-Security Account Manager**
     - This technique involves accessing Security Account Manager (SAM) files to obtain credentials. It does not directly relate to the anti-analysis characteristic of checking the number of running processes.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. While it is related to anti-analysis, it does not specifically involve checking the number of running processes.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from password stores. It does not directly relate to the anti-analysis characteristic of checking the number of running processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that after Trickbot exhibits anti-analysis characteristics by checking the total number of running processes, it would likely use a technique that directly involves checking system properties or processes.
   - **Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** (Although this choice is not a direct match, it is the closest to the described behavior among the given options. The correct technique should be T1497.001-System Checks, but since it is not listed, C is the best fit among the provided choices.)

Given the options, the best fit is **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**.
