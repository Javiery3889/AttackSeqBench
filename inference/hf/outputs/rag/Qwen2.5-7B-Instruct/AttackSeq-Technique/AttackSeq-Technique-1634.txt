Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. SUNSPOT malware used AES128-CBC encryption to protect targeted source code files for defense evasion.
2. After this, the malware monitored running processes to detect MsBuild.exe during the discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and monitoring processes to gather information about the target environment.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding or obfuscating files to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP most likely occurred before the malware monitored running processes to detect MsBuild.exe during the discovery phase.

- **A: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique involves using HTML to smuggle data or code. It does not directly relate to the encryption of files or process monitoring.
- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding or obfuscating files, registry keys, and processes to evade detection. This aligns with the use of AES128-CBC encryption to protect files.
- **C: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing web traffic to steal credentials or other sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the encryption of files or process monitoring.
- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run malware. It does not directly relate to the encryption of files or process monitoring.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that the malware used AES128-CBC encryption to protect targeted source code files. This aligns with the T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information technique.
- The malware then monitored running processes to detect MsBuild.exe. This aligns with the T1057-Process Discovery technique.
- The T1564-Hide Artifacts technique involves hiding or obfuscating files, which is a plausible step that could occur before the encryption of files and the subsequent process monitoring.

### Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts
