Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. APT-TOCS downloads Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell.
2. Maintains multi-beacon communication for evasion.
3. Establishes secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
  - Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
  - Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

**A: T1654-Log Enumeration**
- This technique is not directly related to establishing secure communication or using HTTP GET requests. It is more about enumerating logs, which does not fit the context of the question.

**B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
- This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which is relevant to the PowerShell usage mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly address the secure communication aspect using HTTP GET requests.

**C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
- This technique involves symmetric cryptography, which is a method of encryption. While it is related to secure communication, it does not specifically address the use of HTTP GET requests.

**D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
- This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel, which aligns with the need for secure communication. The use of HTTP GET requests to specific URLs for secure communication fits well with this technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the establishment of secure communication using HTTP GET requests, which is a form of web protocol communication.
- The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is directly related to using web protocols for command and control.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel (D) is the most relevant technique as it involves establishing an encrypted channel, which can be used to secure HTTP GET requests.

**Final Answer: D**
