### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after CosmicDuke utilized a keylogger and a screenshotter for gathering user activity information.
   - Keyloggers and screenshotters are techniques used for data collection, specifically for gathering user activity information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Collection" and the technique is "T1056.001-Keylogging."
   - This confirms that the initial actions (keylogging and screenshotting) fall under the "Collection" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique is about moving data out of the target environment. It is not directly related to the initial data collection phase but rather the exfiltration phase.
   - **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves using a network provider DLL to establish a covert channel. It is not directly related to the data collection phase but rather to establishing a persistent presence or covert communication.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which is a logical step after gathering user activity information. It fits well with the sequence of actions described.
   - **D: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves stealing data from the clipboard. While it is a form of data collection, it is not directly related to the keylogging and screenshotting described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first gather user activity information (keylogging and screenshotting) and then archive the collected data.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: C: T1560-Archive Collected Data"
