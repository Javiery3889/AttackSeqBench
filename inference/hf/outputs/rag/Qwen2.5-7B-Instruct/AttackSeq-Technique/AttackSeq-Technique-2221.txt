Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
- Earth Lusca used adfind and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
- The reconnaissance gathered network configuration and domain information.
- The next step was the sending of spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred after the reconnaissance phase but before the spear phishing emails were sent.

- **T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal (A)**: This technique is related to network traversal and not directly to reconnaissance or initial access.
- **T1596.003-Digital Certificates (B)**: This technique is related to the use of digital certificates, which is not directly related to the reconnaissance or initial access phase.
- **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (C)**: This technique is related to abusing control mechanisms, which is not directly related to the reconnaissance or initial access phase.
- **T1595-Active Scanning (D)**: This technique involves actively scanning networks, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase. However, it does not directly lead to the sending of spear phishing emails.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Reconnaissance (adfind and PowerSploit)
- Active Scanning (T1595-Active Scanning)
- Spear Phishing (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link)

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D
