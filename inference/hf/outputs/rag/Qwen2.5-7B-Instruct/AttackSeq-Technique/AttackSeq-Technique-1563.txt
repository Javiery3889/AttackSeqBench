Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after establishing command and control using a backdoor with overlapping features with Kazuar, we need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred prior to this in the context of the SolarWinds incident.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple channels for command and control, which aligns with the use of a backdoor.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is a common step in reconnaissance.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain, which is a method of initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to command and control, it does not directly address the initial access or reconnaissance steps.
- **Answer Choice B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware, which is a common method of initial access. However, it does not directly align with the use of a backdoor or the supply chain compromise.
- **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain, which is a method of initial access. It aligns well with the context of the SolarWinds incident, where the attackers used a compromised update mechanism to deliver malware.
- **Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique involves using systemd timers for persistence, which is a method of maintaining access but does not directly address the initial access or reconnaissance steps.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SolarWinds incident involved a sophisticated supply chain attack where the attackers compromised the software supply chain to deliver malware.
- The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred prior to establishing command and control using a backdoor.
- Among the given choices, T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (Answer Choice C) is the most relevant and aligns with the context of the SolarWinds incident.

### Final Answer: C
