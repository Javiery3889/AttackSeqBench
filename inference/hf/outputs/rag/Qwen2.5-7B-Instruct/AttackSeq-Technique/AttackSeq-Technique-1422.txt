### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where macOS malware uses a Bash script to install persistent extensions and then deploys LaunchAgents for persistence.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates malware execution during boot or user logon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent** - This technique is related to using Launch Agents for persistence, which aligns with the question's mention of deploying LaunchAgents.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.002-AppleScript** - This technique involves using AppleScript, which is not directly related to the question's focus on Bash scripts and LaunchAgents.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent** - This technique is directly related to using Launch Agents for persistence, which is a key part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique is specifically designed to ensure that malware runs during boot or user logon. It aligns well with the question's focus on execution during boot or logon.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1614.001-System Language Discovery** - This technique is about discovering the system language, which is not relevant to the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment, which is not directly related to the question's focus on execution during boot or logon.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** - This technique involves using PowerShell profiles, which is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the use of Bash scripts and LaunchAgents.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitates malware execution during boot or user logon is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: A**
