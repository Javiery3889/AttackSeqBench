### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Shellbot has already discovered monitoring tools and host information.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing persistent communication with the C&C servers via IRC.
   - We need to identify the TTP that logically occurs between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This is relevant as it involves the communication with the C&C servers.
   - **Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This is specifically about using application layer protocols for C2, which aligns with IRC.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This is about discovering processes on the host, which is a form of discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying software on the host. While it is a form of discovery, it is not directly related to the next step of establishing C2.
   - **B: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which is also a form of discovery but not directly related to the next step of C2.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves discovering services on the network, which is a form of discovery but not directly related to the next step of C2.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This involves hiding files or processes, which is not directly related to the next step of C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve a step that directly follows the discovery of monitoring tools and host information and precedes the establishment of persistent communication via IRC.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** (related to Tactic: Discovery) is a form of discovery that could be relevant, but it is not the most direct step towards establishing C2.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** (related to Tactic: Command and Control) is the most direct step towards establishing C2 via IRC.

### Final Answer: B: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning

This choice is the most plausible because vulnerability scanning is a form of discovery that could be relevant in the context of gathering more information about the target environment, which could then lead to the next step of establishing persistent communication. However, the most direct and relevant TTP for the next step would be T1071-Application Layer Protocol, but since that is not an option, B is the best choice among the given options.
