Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malware collected basic information like IP address, hostname, and Bitcoin wallet addresses during the Discovery phase.
2. The next phase is Collection, where the malware is likely to gather screen recording files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

These techniques are related to the Discovery phase and involve gathering information about the system and network. However, they do not directly relate to the Collection phase where screen recording files are gathered.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the Collection phase:

- **A: T1036.006-Space after Filename**
  - This technique involves using spaces in file names to evade detection. It is not directly related to gathering screen recording files.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing screenshots or screen recordings. This aligns well with the Collection phase where the malware is gathering screen recording files.

- **C: T1012-Query Registry**
  - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information. It is more relevant to the Discovery phase and does not directly relate to the Collection phase.

- **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
  - This technique involves using messaging applications to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to gathering screen recording files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the malware is in the Collection phase and is gathering screen recording files.
- Among the given options, T1113-Screen Capture (B) is the only technique that directly relates to gathering screen recording files.

### Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture
