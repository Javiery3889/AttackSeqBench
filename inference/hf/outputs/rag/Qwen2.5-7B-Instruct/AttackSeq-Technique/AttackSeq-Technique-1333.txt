Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gaining command and control through HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites.
2. Moving between systems using a `net use` command after positive ping responses.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Discovery**: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- **Collection**: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle
- **Lateral Movement**: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
- SSH Hijacking involves intercepting and hijacking an SSH session. This does not align with the use of `net use` and ping responses for lateral movement.

**B: T1021-Remote Services**
- T1021 involves using remote services to establish a foothold on a system. This could potentially align with the use of `net use` to map network drives, but it doesn't directly address the ping responses and the sequence of actions described.

**C: T1106-Native API**
- T1106 involves using native APIs to perform actions on the system. While this could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the use of `net use` and the ping responses for lateral movement.

**D: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
- T1564.005 involves creating hidden file systems, which is not directly related to the use of `net use` and the ping responses for lateral movement.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the use of `net use` and the ping responses for lateral movement. The technique that best fits this description is **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**, which involves transferring tools or scripts to facilitate lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D**
