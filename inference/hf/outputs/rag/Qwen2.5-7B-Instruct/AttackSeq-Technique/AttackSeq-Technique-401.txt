Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Enabling Macro content to execute the payload through `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`.
2. Initiating SSL communication with a command and control server using an expired digital certificate.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate**: This technique involves installing a digital certificate, which aligns with the use of an expired digital certificate for SSL communication.
- **T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using `Rundll32` to execute code, which aligns with the use of `Rundll32` to execute the payload.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols, but it does not directly relate to the use of an expired digital certificate or the use of `Rundll32`.
- **B: T1542.003-Bootkit**: This technique involves bootkits, which are typically used for persistence and are not directly related to the use of an expired digital certificate or `Rundll32`.
- **C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the use of an expired digital certificate or `Rundll32`.
- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox detection, which is not directly related to the use of an expired digital certificate or `Rundll32`.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that involves enabling a payload through `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`, and then using an expired digital certificate for SSL communication.
- The related TTPs mention `Rundll32` and the installation of a digital certificate.
- Among the answer choices, **T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate** (related to installing a digital certificate) is the most relevant to the use of an expired digital certificate for SSL communication.

### Final Answer: C
