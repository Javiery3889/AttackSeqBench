Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a .LNK object in a malicious email attachment executes a PowerShell command to download and inject shellcode into `wabmig.exe`. The question asks which ATT&CK technique ensures the RAT (Remote Access Tool) remains active even after system restarts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (A)**: This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when the system boots up or when a user logs on. This is a common method to ensure persistence and maintain access even after a system restart.
- **T1566-Phishing (B)**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing information or downloading malware. It does not directly address ensuring persistence after a system restart.
- **T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions (C)**: This technique involves gaining additional permissions through email, which is not directly related to ensuring persistence after a system restart.
- **T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking (D)**: This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to load malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most common or direct method for ensuring a RAT remains active after a system restart.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where a malicious file (`.LNK` object) is executed via PowerShell, and the shellcode is injected into `wabmig.exe`. This indicates that the malware is already present and active.
- To ensure the RAT remains active after a system restart, the most common and direct method is to use a boot or logon autostart execution technique.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (A) is the most plausible technique to ensure the RAT remains active even after a system restart.

### Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
