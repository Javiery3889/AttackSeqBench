### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the initial access was gained through malicious Word documents delivered via spear-phishing emails.
   - The specific part of the question that needs to be addressed is the use of crafted emails featuring personal data of the deputy head doctor to deceive targets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - This indicates that the question is focused on the initial phase of the attack, specifically the method used to gain initial access through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information**:
     - This technique involves using information about the target to craft a more convincing phishing attack. It fits the context of using personal data to deceive the targets.
   - **B: T1135-Network Share Discovery**:
     - This technique is about discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the initial access through spear-phishing.
   - **C: T1591.002-Business Relationships**:
     - This technique involves using business relationships to gain access, which is not directly related to the spear-phishing attack described.
   - **D: T1204.002-Malicious File**:
     - This technique involves using a malicious file, which is part of the attack but does not address the initial deception through spear-phishing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the use of personal data to craft a convincing spear-phishing email, which is best described by the technique T1598-Phishing for Information.

**Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
