### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malware, ChChes, uses a specific code signing certificate to evade detection.
   - After this evasion technique, the malware is expected to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) servers to receive commands and modules.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Defense Evasion" and the technique "T1553.002-Code Signing."
   - T1553.002-Code Signing is a specific sub-technique of T1553, which is "Subvert Trust Controls." This technique involves using legitimate digital certificates to sign malicious code, thereby evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection** - This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate files or web pages. It does not directly relate to the communication with C&C servers.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encryption to hide the communication between the malware and the C&C server. While this could be a plausible technique for communication, it does not directly follow the use of a code signing certificate for evasion.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** - This technique is directly related to the use of a code signing certificate to evade detection. Since the question mentions that the malware uses a code signing certificate to evade detection, it is logical that the next step would be to use this certificate to establish a secure and trusted communication channel with the C&C server.
   - **D: T1205.001-Port Knocking** - This technique involves using a sequence of connections to a specific port to establish a connection. It is not directly related to the use of a code signing certificate for evasion.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using a code signing certificate to evade detection, the malware would use the same certificate to establish a secure and trusted communication channel with its C&C server.

Final Answer: C
