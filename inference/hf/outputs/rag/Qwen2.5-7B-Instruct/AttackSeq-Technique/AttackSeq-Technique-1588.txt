Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. T9000 (DLL sideloading using igfxtray.exe) executed malicious functionality.
2. The next step was to customize the installation to evade 24 identified security products.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering security software on the target system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves the adversary using DLL side-loading to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the answer choices aligns best with the sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the adversary using shared libraries to execute malicious code. While it is related to DLL side-loading, it does not directly address the customization of the installation to evade security products.
- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves the adversary hiding files, processes, and network connections to avoid detection. This could be a step after the initial execution but does not directly address the customization of the installation.
- **C: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves the adversary collecting data automatically. It does not directly relate to the customization of the installation to evade security products.
- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves the adversary evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. This could be a step after the initial execution and customization to evade security products.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial step is T9000, which involves DLL sideloading using igfxtray.exe.
- The next step is to customize the installation to evade 24 identified security products.
- Among the given choices, T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (D) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the evasion of security products, which is the next step in the sequence described.

### Final Answer: D
