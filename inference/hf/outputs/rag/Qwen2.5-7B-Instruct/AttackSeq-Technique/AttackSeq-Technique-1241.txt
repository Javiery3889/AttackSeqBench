### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WinDealer used a complex IP generation algorithm for Command and Control (C2) activity and communicated with machines selected from specific IP ranges within AS4134.
   - The key points are:
     - Use of a complex IP generation algorithm.
     - Communication with machines from specific IP ranges within AS4134.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):** This technique involves the use of algorithms to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communication.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the C2 infrastructure to avoid detection.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows registry. It is not directly related to IP generation or DNS communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.011-Ignore Process Interrupts**
     - This technique involves ignoring process interrupts to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to IP generation or DNS communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into web pages or other files. It is not directly related to IP generation or DNS communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This is the same as Answer Choice C, so it is not a valid choice.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question mentions a complex IP generation algorithm, which aligns with **T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**.
   - The communication with machines from specific IP ranges within AS4134 suggests the use of DNS for C2 communication, which aligns with **T1071.004-DNS**.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
- **T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms** (for the complex IP generation algorithm)
- **T1071.004-DNS** (for the communication with machines from specific IP ranges within AS4134)

Since the question asks for a single answer choice, and the most relevant technique from the provided choices is **T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
