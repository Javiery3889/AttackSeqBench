### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by SkinnyBoy, including directory enumeration and system information retrieval.
   - The next step in the sequence is to process and gather data for the exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Discovery" and "File and Directory Discovery" (T1083).
   - This indicates that the initial actions (directory enumeration and system information retrieval) are part of the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, directories, or registry entries to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the data gathering and exfiltration process.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves the automated collection of data, which aligns with the next logical step after gathering system information and directories. It fits well with the context of preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
   - **D: T1218.012-Verclsid**
     - This technique involves using Verclsid to enumerate and interact with COM objects. It is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the sequence is the automated collection of data, which aligns with the context of preparing data for exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
