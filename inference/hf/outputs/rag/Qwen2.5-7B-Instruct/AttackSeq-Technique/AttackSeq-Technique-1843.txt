### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers to coordinate its malicious activities.
   - BlackEnergy is known for its use of C&C servers to coordinate attacks, which aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of web protocols for C2.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.003-Hidden Window:** This technique involves hiding windows to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative C2 channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a system's compute resources. It does not directly follow the communication with C&C servers.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection. While it could be a follow-up technique, it is not directly related to the communication with C&C servers.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data. It is a destructive action but not directly related to the communication with C&C servers.
   - **D: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information. While it could be a follow-up action, it is not directly related to the communication with C&C servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers to coordinate its malicious activities would be a technique that directly follows the C2 communication. The technique T1008-Fallback Channels (related to Command and Control) is a logical next step as it involves using alternative C2 channels, which could be necessary if the primary C2 channel is detected or blocked.

**Final Answer: C**
