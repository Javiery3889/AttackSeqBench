Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access through spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word attachments.
2. Implanting the PlugX RAT.
3. Achieving persistence using Service + Run Key.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique is relevant to the initial access phase, where a malicious file (in this case, a Word attachment) is used.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** - This technique is directly related to achieving persistence.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique is relevant to the initial access phase, specifically through spear-phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique is not directly related to the sequence described. It involves using shared libraries or modules, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves encoding payloads to avoid detection. While it could be part of the initial access phase, it is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job** - This technique is related to container orchestration, which is not relevant to the described attack sequence.
- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique is directly related to achieving persistence, specifically through registry run keys or startup folders. It aligns with the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word attachments (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
2. The PlugX RAT is then implanted (not directly a TTP but a result of the initial access).
3. Persistence is achieved using Service + Run Key (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is directly related to achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
