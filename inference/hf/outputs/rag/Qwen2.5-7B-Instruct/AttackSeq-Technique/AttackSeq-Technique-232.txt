### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a multi-step process where a threat actor group uses batch files to decode and deploy additional malicious payloads.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the delivery of the malicious documents to victim organizations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution and the Techniques: T1204.002-Malicious File and T1059.003-Windows Command Shell.
   - T1204.002-Malicious File indicates the use of malicious files, which aligns with the batch files mentioned in the question.
   - T1059.003-Windows Command Shell suggests the use of command-line interfaces, which could be part of the execution process but does not directly address the delivery of malicious documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1137.006-Add-ins**
     - This technique involves adding malicious add-ins to software, which could be a method to deliver malicious documents. However, it does not directly align with the use of batch files.
   - **Option B: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is a more indirect and complex method of delivery and does not directly align with the use of batch files.
   - **Option C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves abusing mechanisms to gain elevated privileges, which is more about gaining access rather than delivering malicious documents.
   - **Option D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing access or clicking on malicious links/documents. This aligns well with the delivery of malicious documents via batch files, as phishing is a common method to trick users into executing malicious files.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
