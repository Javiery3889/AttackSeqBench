Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Backdoor malware is used for stealthy code execution.
2. An ATT&CK technique is used to maintain access.
3. The remote-desktop protocol (RDP) is leveraged for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021-Remote Services** (which includes T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol)
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to find the ATT&CK technique that best fits the context of maintaining access before leveraging RDP for lateral movement.

- **A: T1136-Create Account** - This technique involves creating new user accounts to maintain persistence. While it can be used to maintain access, it doesn't directly relate to the use of backdoor malware for stealthy code execution.
- **B: T1586-Compromise Accounts** - This technique involves compromising existing user accounts to maintain access. It is more about gaining access to existing accounts rather than creating new ones.
- **C: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking** - This technique involves modifying dynamic link libraries to maintain persistence. It is more about modifying system files rather than directly leveraging RDP for lateral movement.
- **D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence. It is a method to ensure that malicious code is executed every time PowerShell is started, which can be used to maintain access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions using backdoor malware for stealthy code execution, which aligns with maintaining access.
- The technique should be something that can be used to ensure the malware continues to function and maintain access.
- Among the options, **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** (D) is the most relevant because it directly relates to maintaining access by ensuring the malware is executed every time PowerShell is used, which can be a common method for maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer: D
