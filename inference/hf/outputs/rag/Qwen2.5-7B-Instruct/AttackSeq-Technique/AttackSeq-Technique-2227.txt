Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan to gather NetBIOS name information and shared folders.
2. This occurred during the Discovery phase.
3. The next step was transferring tools and establishing network tunnels for Lateral Movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1018-Remote System Discovery (part of the Discovery tactic)
- T1046-Network Service Discovery (part of the Discovery tactic)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the provided information:

- **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique is related to modifying the execution flow of a process, which is not directly related to the scanning and discovery of NetBIOS name information and shared folders.

- **B: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying services running on a network, which is closely related to the use of tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan to gather NetBIOS name information and shared folders. This aligns well with the description of the initial scanning phase.

- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying software running on a system, which is more about identifying installed software rather than scanning for NetBIOS name information and shared folders.

- **D: T1036.007-Double File Extension**
  - This technique involves using double file extensions to hide malicious files, which is not directly related to the scanning and discovery phase described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Earth Lusca used tools to gather NetBIOS name information and shared folders, which aligns with T1046-Network Service Discovery.
- The next step in the sequence is transferring tools and establishing network tunnels for Lateral Movement, which is a separate phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial scanning and discovery phase is best described by T1046-Network Service Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
