Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after deploying scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner for network discovery, the next step is to facilitate Earth Lusca's movement within the network. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique would logically follow network discovery to enable movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the tactic of "Discovery" and the technique "T1046-Network Service Discovery." This indicates that the scanning tools are used to discover network services, which is a form of network discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
  - This technique is directly related to the scanning tools mentioned in the question. However, it is more about discovering services rather than facilitating movement within the network.

- **B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**
  - This technique involves using ptrace system calls to monitor or control processes. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly facilitate network movement.

- **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - This technique involves using spearphishing to gain access to internal systems. It is more about gaining initial access rather than facilitating movement within the network.

- **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access or move laterally within the network. This aligns well with the context of having discovered network services (T1046) and then needing to move within the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where scanning tools are used for network discovery.
- The related TTPs confirm that the technique T1046-Network Service Discovery is relevant.
- To facilitate movement within the network after discovering services, the next logical step would be to exploit these services to gain access and move laterally.
- T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services fits this scenario perfectly.

### Final Answer: D
