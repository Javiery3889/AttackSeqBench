Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy encoded data and exfiltrated it to its C2 server via a structured HTTP POST request. This implies that the technique in question should be a preparatory step for both encoding and exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to bypass certain security measures.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is consistent with the question's mention of exfiltrating data via a structured HTTP POST request to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1036.009-Break Process Trees**
  - This technique involves breaking process trees to hide the attacker's presence. It is not directly related to encoding or exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting content into a web page or other web resource. It is not directly related to encoding or exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to bypass certain security measures. It is a direct precursor to encoding data, which is mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting data automatically, which could be a preparatory step for exfiltration. However, it does not specifically address the encoding step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the technique should occur before encoding and exfiltration.
- T1132.001-Standard Encoding (related to encoding) is a direct precursor to the encoding step.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (related to exfiltration) is a step that follows encoding.

Given the sequence and the need for a preparatory step for both encoding and exfiltration, the most plausible technique that occurs before encoding and exfiltration is T1132.001-Standard Encoding.

### Final Answer: C
