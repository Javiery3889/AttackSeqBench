### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the use of the Aria-body backdoor to perform actions such as collecting file metadata, taking screenshots, and gathering system information.
   - It specifically asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before gathering information on active processes and their loaded modules.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques under the "Discovery" tactic, which aligns with the question's context of the backdoor performing various actions.
   - The techniques mentioned are:
     - T1082-System Information Discovery
     - T1057-Process Discovery
     - T1113-Screen Capture

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1069.003-Cloud Groups (A):** This technique is not directly related to the context of the question, which focuses on gathering information on active processes and their loaded modules.
   - **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information (B):** This technique is more general and could be part of the initial reconnaissance but does not specifically target active processes and their loaded modules.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery (C):** This technique directly targets the discovery of active processes and their loaded modules, which is the specific information being gathered in the question.
   - **T1566-Phishing (D):** This technique is related to social engineering and is not directly relevant to the specific information gathering described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs where T1057-Process Discovery (C) is the technique that most likely occurred before gathering information on active processes and their loaded modules, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: C**
