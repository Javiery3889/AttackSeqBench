### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before BlackSoul utilized obfuscation techniques in its loader and retrieved components from the Cloudflare Workers service.
   - The key points are:
     - BlackSoul utilized obfuscation techniques.
     - Components were retrieved from the Cloudflare Workers service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.007-Serverless**
     - This technique involves the use of serverless computing to host malicious code or components.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves removing or decoding obfuscation from malicious files or information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**
     - This technique involves the use of firmware to deliver malware. It does not align with the retrieval of components from a web service.
   - **Option B: T1569.002-Service Execution**
     - This technique involves the execution of a service. While it could be related to the execution of the loader, it does not directly address the retrieval of components from a web service.
   - **Option C: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves the execution of a user-installed application. It does not align with the retrieval of components from a web service.
   - **Option D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves the use of a web service to host and deliver malicious content. This aligns well with the retrieval of components from the Cloudflare Workers service.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that BlackSoul utilized a web service (T1102) to retrieve components from the Cloudflare Workers service before employing obfuscation techniques.

**Final Answer: D**
