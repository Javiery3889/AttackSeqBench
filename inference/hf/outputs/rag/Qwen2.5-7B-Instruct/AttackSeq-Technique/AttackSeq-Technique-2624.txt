### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Machete (a hypothetical adversary) uses self-extracting files for software packing to evade defenses.
   - The sequence then moves to scanning the compromised system for stored browser credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Credential Access" as the tactic and "T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers" as the technique.
   - This indicates that the question is focused on credential access, specifically targeting browser credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs**
     - This technique involves clearing logs to cover tracks. It does not directly relate to the scanning of browser credentials.
   - **B: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information from web browsers, which aligns with the question's focus on scanning for stored browser credentials.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves making an adversary appear to be something else, which does not fit the context of scanning for browser credentials.
   - **D: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
     - This technique involves using a Terminal Services DLL to execute code, which is not related to the scanning of browser credentials.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after Machete employed self-extracting files for software packing to evade defenses, the next step would be to gather information from web browsers, which aligns with the technique of "T1217-Browser Information Discovery."

**Final Answer: B**
