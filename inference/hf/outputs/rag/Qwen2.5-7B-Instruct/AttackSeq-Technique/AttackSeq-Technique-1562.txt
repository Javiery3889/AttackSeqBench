Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs during Operation NightScout:
1. Gaining initial access through a supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism.
2. Evading detection.
3. Extracting C&C information to a file on the victim's system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp**: This technique involves modifying the file timestamps to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making malicious artifacts appear legitimate to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the system for security controls and defenses. It does not directly relate to evading detection after gaining access.
- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding malicious artifacts to evade detection. While it is related to evasion, it does not specifically align with the context of the supply chain attack.
- **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access. It is relevant to the initial access part of the sequence but not to evasion.
- **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing to gain access. It does not align with the supply chain attack context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes gaining initial access through a supply chain attack, which aligns with **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**.
- After gaining access, the next step is to evade detection. The related TTPs mention **T1070.006-Timestomp** and **T1036-Masquerading**.
- **T1070.006-Timestomp** involves modifying file timestamps, which is a direct method to evade detection.
- **T1036-Masquerading** involves making malicious artifacts appear legitimate, which is also a method to evade detection.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with evading detection after gaining initial access through a supply chain attack is **T1070.006-Timestomp**.

### Final Answer: A: T1497.001-System Checks

However, upon re-evaluation, the correct answer should be **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts** as it directly aligns with the context of hiding malicious artifacts to evade detection, which is a common technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
