Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by threat actors:
1. Evasion using functions like 'ZwProtectVirtualMemory' and 'ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64'.
2. Establishing command and control (C2) through HTTP/HTTPS communications with a specific mechanism.
3. Querying registry values using 'GetStringValue' and 'GetDWORDValue'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1012-Query Registry

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Evasion**: The question mentions evasion techniques, which are part of the initial compromise and are not directly related to the TTPs provided. However, these techniques are common in the initial stages of an attack.
- **C2**: The question suggests that the threat actors will establish C2 through HTTP/HTTPS communications. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.
- **Registry Query**: The question mentions querying registry values using 'GetStringValue' and 'GetDWORDValue'. T1012-Query Registry is a technique that involves querying registry keys to gather information about the system, which aligns with the question's description of discovery tactics.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Evasion**: The question mentions evasion techniques, but these are not directly related to the TTPs provided.
2. **C2**: Establishing C2 through HTTP/HTTPS is a common method and aligns with the question's description.
3. **Registry Query**: T1012-Query Registry is a technique that involves querying registry keys, which aligns with the question's description of discovery tactics.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the TTPs provided, particularly T1012-Query Registry for the discovery tactic.

Final Answer: A: Yes
