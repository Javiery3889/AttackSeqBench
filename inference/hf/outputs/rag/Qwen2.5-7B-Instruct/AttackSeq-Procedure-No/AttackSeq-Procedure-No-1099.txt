Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by CosmicDuke:
1. Using document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening malicious PDF files.
2. Executing malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
3. Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.
4. Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the exfiltration and collection techniques:
- **Exfiltration via FTP and WebDav**: This is covered by the TTP "T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol."
- **Data Collection**: This is covered by the TTP "T1005-Data from Local System."

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate if the sequence described in the question aligns with the provided TTPs:
- **FTP and WebDav for Exfiltration and Updating**: This is directly supported by the TTP "T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol."
- **Data Collection**: This is directly supported by the TTP "T1005-Data from Local System."

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Document-based Exploits**: This is a common initial step for many malware campaigns, including CosmicDuke.
2. **Malware Execution**: The malware is executed with updated loaders, which is consistent with the evolution of malware techniques.
3. **Exfiltration via FTP and WebDav**: This is a plausible method for CosmicDuke to exfiltrate data and update its infrastructure.
4. **Data Collection**: Keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing are common data collection techniques used by CosmicDuke.

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the provided TTPs, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
