Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Poison Ivy server is delivered via social engineering methods and asks if it is likely that the malware will use Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves delivering malicious code to a user, which aligns with the scenario of delivering the Poison Ivy server via social engineering.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves using bidirectional communication channels for C2, which is relevant to the question about C2 communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will use Google Drive for C2 communications.
  - While Google Drive is a plausible method for C2 communications, it is not a common or typical choice for malware like Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy is known to use more direct and less traceable methods for C2, such as custom protocols or less obvious cloud storage services.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use Google Drive for C2 communications.
  - Given the nature of Poison Ivy and the typical methods it uses for C2, this answer seems more plausible. Poison Ivy is often configured to use custom protocols or less obvious methods to avoid detection, rather than relying on a well-known cloud service like Google Drive.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the delivery of the Poison Ivy server via social engineering, which aligns with the T1204-User Execution technique.
- The C2 phase involves bidirectional communication, which aligns with the T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication technique.
- Poison Ivy is known to use custom protocols and less obvious methods for C2, rather than relying on well-known cloud services like Google Drive.
- Therefore, it is less likely that Poison Ivy would use Google Drive for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: B**
