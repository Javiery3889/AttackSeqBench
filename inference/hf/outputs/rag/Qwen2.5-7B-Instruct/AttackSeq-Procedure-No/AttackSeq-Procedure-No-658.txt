Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Running discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems.
2. Starting a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin.
3. Using webshells for lateral movement to other systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1021.005-VNC**: This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access.
- **T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: This technique involves using RDP for remote access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery Commands**: The question mentions running discovery commands, which is a common initial step in reconnaissance.
- **Remote VNC Session**: The question specifically asks about starting a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin.
- **Webshells for Lateral Movement**: The question also mentions using webshells for lateral movement.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Discovery Commands**: This is a common initial step where attackers gather information about the network and systems.
2. **Remote VNC Session**: The question specifically mentions downloading a new plugin to start a VNC session. This is a plausible step after gathering information.
3. **Webshells for Lateral Movement**: Using webshells for lateral movement is a common technique to move between systems.

### Final Answer
Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Discovery commands (initial reconnaissance)
- Starting a remote VNC session (using a new plugin)
- Using webshells for lateral movement

Therefore, the answer is:
Final Answer: A
