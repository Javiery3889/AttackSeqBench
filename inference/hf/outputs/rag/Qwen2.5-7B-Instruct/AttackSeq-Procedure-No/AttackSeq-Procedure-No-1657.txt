Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Execution of encoded PowerShell commands.
2. Downloading and executing payloads from URLs.
3. Utilizing fileless techniques to avoid detection.
4. Establishing a connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to maintain access to the target network.
- **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple channels for command and control, which can help in evading detection.
- **Tactic: Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to run malicious code on the target system.
- **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which is a common method for executing malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial actions (encoded PowerShell commands, downloading and executing payloads), the campaign would use fileless techniques to avoid detection.
  - Fileless techniques are often used to evade traditional antivirus and endpoint protection systems by not writing files to disk.
  - The establishment of a connection with the C2 server (61.97.243.15) is a common step in many cyber campaigns, including those that use fileless techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the campaign would not use fileless techniques to avoid detection after establishing the C2 connection.
  - This would be less likely because fileless techniques are a common method to evade detection, especially in campaigns like FHAPPI, which is known for its sophisticated and stealthy methods.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The FHAPPI campaign is known for its use of sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
- The use of encoded PowerShell commands and downloading payloads from URLs are common initial steps in many cyber attacks.
- Establishing a connection with the C2 server is a necessary step for further command and control activities.
- Given the nature of the FHAPPI campaign and the techniques mentioned, it is highly likely that the campaign would use fileless techniques to avoid detection after establishing the C2 connection.

### Final Answer: Yes
