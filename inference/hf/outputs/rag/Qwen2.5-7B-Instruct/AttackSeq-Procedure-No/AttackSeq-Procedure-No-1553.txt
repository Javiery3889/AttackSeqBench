Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Gaining initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
2. Using a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1566-Phishing**: This is a broad category that includes various forms of phishing, which aligns with the initial access through spear phishing emails.
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This is a specific technique within the broader category of T1566, which directly mentions spear phishing emails containing links.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions gaining initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails. This aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link TTP.
- **Reconnaissance**: The question also mentions a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software. This is a form of reconnaissance, which is a common step in the attack lifecycle.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails. This is a specific technique (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) that fits the initial access phase.
2. **Reconnaissance**: After gaining access, the attackers use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to gather information about the installed software. This is a form of reconnaissance, which is a logical next step after gaining initial access.

Given the alignment of the provided TTPs with the described sequence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
