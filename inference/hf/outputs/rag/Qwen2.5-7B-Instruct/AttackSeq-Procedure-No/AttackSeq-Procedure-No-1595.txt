Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Establishing communication with a C&C server.
2. Downloading malware or monitoring the victim's communications.
3. Employing a keylogger to capture keystrokes.
4. Gaining access to additional accounts under the Tactic of Credential Access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the gathering of login credentials from the victim's system.
- **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords and other credentials.

Given that Rocket Kitten is known for its activities in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and the related TTPs specifically mention keylogging as a technique under the Credential Access tactic, it is highly plausible that Rocket Kitten would employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions that align with the Credential Access tactic.
2. The related TTPs explicitly mention keylogging as a technique under the Credential Access tactic.
3. Keylogging is a common method for capturing keystrokes and obtaining credentials, which is directly related to the Credential Access tactic.
4. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Rocket Kitten would employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
