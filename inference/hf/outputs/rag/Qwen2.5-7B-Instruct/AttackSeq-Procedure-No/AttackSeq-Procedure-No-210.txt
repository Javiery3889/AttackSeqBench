Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. System information discovery
2. Screen capture
3. Communication with a C2 server over a non-standard port
4. Exfiltration of data through the same C2 channel

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture**: These are reconnaissance activities that are typically part of the initial compromise and are not directly related to the TTPs provided in the question.
- **Communication with a C2 Server Over a Non-Standard Port**: This is a common technique used by malware to establish a covert communication channel. It aligns with the tactic of Command and Control (C2) and is a plausible step in the sequence.
- **Exfiltration of Data Through the Same C2 Channel**: This is a direct exfiltration technique that uses the established C2 channel. It aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture**: These are initial reconnaissance activities and do not directly relate to the TTPs in the question.
2. **Communication with a C2 Server Over a Non-Standard Port**: This is a plausible step as it establishes a covert communication channel.
3. **Exfiltration of Data Through the Same C2 Channel**: This is a direct exfiltration technique that uses the established C2 channel, which is consistent with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
