Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
2. Communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers.
3. Installation through employee-enabled macro execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
- **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections, which also fits the reconnaissance phase.
- **T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This technique involves checking user activity, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the reconnaissance activities, the next step is to establish communication with C2 servers before installing the malware.
  - This sequence aligns well with the typical behavior of many malware families, including BlackEnergy 3. BlackEnergy 3 often uses a multi-stage infection process where initial reconnaissance is followed by establishing a C2 channel, and then the malware is installed.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware would not establish communication with C2 servers before installation.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 and similar malware families, which often establish a C2 channel before or during the installation phase to ensure command and control over the compromised system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where reconnaissance is followed by communication with C2 servers and then installation.
- The related TTPs (T1018, T1049, and T1497.002) all pertain to the reconnaissance phase, which is consistent with the initial activities described in the question.
- BlackEnergy 3, as a known malware family, typically follows a pattern where it establishes a C2 channel before or during the installation phase to ensure it can communicate with its command and control servers.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 and similar malware families.

**Final Answer: Yes**
