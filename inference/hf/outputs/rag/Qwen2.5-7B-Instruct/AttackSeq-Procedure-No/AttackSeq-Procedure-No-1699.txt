Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Abuse of PowerShell for the execution of the Empire stager.
2. Concealment of the execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading.
3. Establishing persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
  - This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which helps in evading detection.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking references to COM objects to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It suggests that after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager, the adversaries would use reflective code loading to conceal the execution of malicious payloads. Then, they would establish persistence by hijacking COM objects.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the sequence described in the question. It suggests that the adversaries would not use these techniques, which does not align with the described attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversaries first use PowerShell to execute the Empire stager, then use reflective code loading to conceal the execution of malicious payloads, and finally establish persistence by hijacking COM objects.
- The related TTPs confirm that both reflective code loading (T1620) and COM object hijacking (T1546.015) are valid techniques for the described sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes all these techniques in the described order.

**Final Answer: A**
