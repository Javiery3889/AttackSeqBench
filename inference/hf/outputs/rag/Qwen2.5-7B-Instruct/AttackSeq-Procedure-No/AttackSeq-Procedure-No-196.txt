Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malware is used in the RevengeHotels campaign to capture credentials from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies. It then asks if it is likely that the malware will also capture mouse movements.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is a form of credential access.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This is the same as the previous one, emphasizing the collection of credentials.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which can include mouse movements.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will capture mouse movements.
  - The related TTPs mention techniques for capturing keystrokes (T1056.001-Keylogging) and user input (T1056-Input Capture), which can include mouse movements.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not capture mouse movements.
  - There is no direct evidence from the related TTPs that the malware will not capture mouse movements.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to capture keystrokes and user input, which can include mouse movements.
- The question does not provide any information that would suggest the malware would not capture mouse movements.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the malware will indeed capture mouse movements.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
