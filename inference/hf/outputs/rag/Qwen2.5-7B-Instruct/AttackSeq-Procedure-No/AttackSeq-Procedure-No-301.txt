Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the IEXPL0RE RAT communicates with the C2 server using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions. It then asks if it is likely to record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords as part of its collection activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel to exfiltrate data. The question already mentions that the IEXPL0RE RAT is using a C2 channel for exfiltration, which aligns with this TTP.
- **Keystroke Logging and Data Exfiltration**: While the question does not explicitly mention keystroke logging, it does ask if the RAT is likely to record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords. This is a common activity for RATs, as it allows the attacker to capture sensitive information like login credentials.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Communication Method**: The IEXPL0RE RAT is using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for communication, which is consistent with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel TTP.
2. **Exfiltration**: The question confirms that the RAT is exfiltrating data, which is a core function of a RAT.
3. **Keystroke Logging**: While not explicitly mentioned, keystroke logging is a common activity for RATs to capture sensitive information like passwords.
4. **Data Exfiltration**: The question also asks if the RAT is likely to exfiltrate data such as passwords, which is a typical activity for a RAT.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the IEXPL0RE RAT is likely to record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords as part of its collection activities.

Final Answer: A
