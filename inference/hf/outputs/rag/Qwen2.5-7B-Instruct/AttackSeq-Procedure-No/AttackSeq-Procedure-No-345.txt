Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using HTTPS for command and control (C2) operations, the malware is likely to use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the operating system, hardware, and network configuration.
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about running processes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique aligns with the 'systeminfo' command, which provides detailed information about the system, including hardware and software configurations.
- **Technique T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique aligns with the 'tasklist' command, which provides a list of running processes.

The question specifically mentions the use of 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo', which directly corresponds to both T1057 and T1082 techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is using HTTPS for C2 operations, which is a common method to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
- After establishing a secure C2 channel, the malware is likely to gather information about the target system to understand its environment and capabilities.
- The 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command is a direct and effective way to gather both process information (T1057) and system information (T1082).
- This command provides a comprehensive overview of the system, which is crucial for the malware to understand the environment and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.

Given the alignment of the command with the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware in gathering information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
