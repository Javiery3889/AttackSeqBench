### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy has already secured access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework for resource development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.001-Upload Malware:** This technique involves uploading malware to targeted systems, which aligns with the use of a modular malware framework.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves the development and deployment of malware, which also aligns with the use of a modular malware framework.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances:** This technique involves evading or bypassing network security appliances, which is a step in the reconnaissance phase but not directly related to the resource development phase described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about the next step after reconnaissance, which is resource development.
   - Both T1608.001-Upload Malware and T1587.001-Malware are directly related to the resource development tactic and involve the use of malware, which can be modular in nature.
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest GreyEnergy would not proceed to use a modular malware framework.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework during resource development.

Final Answer: A
