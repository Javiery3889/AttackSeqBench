Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Data exfiltration using the HTTP protocol.
2. Collection of device information (specifically GPS location).
3. Ensuring persistence by auto-starting at device boot through listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique involves using a command and control (C&C) server for data exfiltration. The question already mentions that data is exfiltrated using the HTTP protocol to a C&C server, which aligns with this technique.
- **Collection of Device Information**: The question asks if the app is likely to collect device information such as GPS location. This is a common practice in malware and malicious apps to gather sensitive information.
- **Persistence**: The question also mentions ensuring persistence by auto-starting at device boot through listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast. This is a common method used by malware to ensure it remains active on the device.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Exfiltration**: The app has already exfiltrated data using the HTTP protocol to a C&C server, which is consistent with the T1041 technique.
2. **Device Information Collection**: Collecting GPS location is a typical action for a malicious app to gather sensitive information.
3. **Persistence**: Ensuring the app starts automatically at device boot is a common method to maintain persistence, which is a tactic used by malware to remain active.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common malicious behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
