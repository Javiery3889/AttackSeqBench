Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after the adversary has gathered data from local systems. Specifically, it asks if the adversary is likely to dump credentials using Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz before copying the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, in preparation for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves the adversary staging data locally before exfiltration. This aligns with the part of the question about copying local file- and directory lists in preparation for exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the adversary collecting data from local systems, which aligns with the initial gathering of data from local systems mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after gathering data from local systems, the adversary will dump credentials using Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz and then copy the results of the discovery phase.
  - This sequence makes sense because after collecting data, dumping credentials (which are often stored in memory) is a common step. Then, the adversary would likely copy the collected data (file and directory lists) to prepare for exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the adversary will not dump credentials using Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz and will not copy the results of the discovery phase.
  - This sequence does not align with typical adversary behavior, as dumping credentials and copying collected data are both common steps in an attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary has already gathered data from local systems.
- The related TTPs indicate that the adversary is likely to stage data locally before exfiltration.
- Dumping credentials (using Mimikatz) is a common step after data collection.
- Copying the results of the discovery phase (file and directory lists) is a logical next step in preparation for exfiltration.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
