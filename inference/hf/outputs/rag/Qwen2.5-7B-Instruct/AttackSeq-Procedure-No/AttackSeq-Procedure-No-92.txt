Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a backdoor (Vyveva's backdoor) after discovering local IP address and system time. It then asks whether the backdoor is likely to steal data from the victim's clipboard, compress collected files, and send them to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the victim's system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include clipboard data, files, and other system information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after discovering the local IP address and system time, the backdoor steals data from the clipboard, compresses collected files, and sends them to the C&C server.
  - Given the related TTPs, T1005-Data from Local System is relevant to collecting data from the local system, which could include clipboard data. However, the question does not explicitly mention clipboard data collection, but it is a plausible step in the data collection process.
  - The compression and sending to the C&C server are also plausible actions in a data exfiltration scenario.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor does not perform the actions described in the question.
  - While it is possible that the backdoor does not perform these actions, the question does not provide enough information to definitively rule out these actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs indicate that the backdoor is likely to collect data from the local system, which could include clipboard data (T1005-Data from Local System).
- The question does not explicitly mention clipboard data, but it is a plausible step in the data collection process.
- The compression and sending to the C&C server are also common actions in a data exfiltration scenario.

Given the plausible nature of the actions described in Answer Choice A and the lack of information to rule them out, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A**
