Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access. It then asks whether it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves attackers using external remote services to gain access to a system. In this case, it aligns with the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying malicious containers on a system. This is a step that occurs after initial access.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007-Container API**: This technique involves accessing credentials through container APIs, which could be a step after deploying malicious containers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.
  - This implies that the detection of the compromised API is a result of the reconnaissance phase, which is not a typical behavior. Typically, adversaries would use reconnaissance to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, and then deploy malicious containers to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that adversaries would detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance, not just after deploying malicious containers.
  - This is more plausible because during reconnaissance, adversaries would likely scan for open ports and services, including Docker APIs, to identify potential entry points. Once they identify the misconfigured Docker API, they would likely use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to further assess the environment and potentially exploit it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access.
- **Step 2**: Adversaries would likely use reconnaissance tools to detect open ports and services, including Docker APIs, during the reconnaissance phase.
- **Step 3**: Once the compromised Docker API is detected, adversaries would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to further assess the environment.
- **Step 4**: Deploying malicious containers is a subsequent step that occurs after the initial access and reconnaissance.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that adversaries would detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance, not just after deploying malicious containers.

**Final Answer: B**
