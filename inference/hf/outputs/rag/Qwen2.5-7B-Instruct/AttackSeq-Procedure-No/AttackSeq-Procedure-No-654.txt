Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory.
2. Employing Impacket tools to perform pass-the-hash.
3. The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actors will retrieve metadata for files on disk or obtain file and directory listings before moving laterally using Impacket's atexec tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process, which is what Mimikatz does.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Pass-the-Hash (T1550.002)**: This technique is used to move laterally within a network using stolen hashes. It does not typically involve retrieving metadata for files on disk or obtaining file and directory listings.
- **LSASS Memory (T1003.001)**: This technique is used to extract credentials from memory, which is what Mimikatz does. This is a prerequisite for pass-the-hash.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Mimikatz to Dump Credentials**: This step is about extracting credentials from memory.
2. **Pass-the-Hash**: This step is about using the extracted credentials to move laterally within the network.
3. **Retrieving Metadata or File Listings**: These actions are not directly related to the pass-the-hash technique. They are more related to data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which are not the primary focus of the described sequence.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include retrieving metadata for files on disk or obtaining file and directory listings before moving laterally using pass-the-hash. The actions described are more focused on credential access and lateral movement.

Final Answer: B: No
