Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
2. Performing network reconnaissance.
3. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells is a clear example of Initial Access.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique)**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access. The exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells fits this technique.

Given these points, the sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the Initial Access tactic and the Exploit Public-Facing Application technique. However, the question asks if it is likely that network reconnaissance was performed only after exploiting the vulnerability to install webshells.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells is a form of Initial Access.
2. **Network Reconnaissance**: Network reconnaissance is typically performed before or during the Initial Access phase to identify vulnerable systems and gather information about the target network.
3. **Credential Dumping**: After gaining access, the adversary might use tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials, which is a common post-exploitation activity.
4. **Webshell Installation**: Installing webshells is a post-exploitation activity that allows the adversary to maintain access and control over the compromised system.

### Conclusion
Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is more plausible that network reconnaissance was performed as part of the Initial Access phase, followed by the exploitation of the vulnerability, and then the installation of webshells. Therefore, the network reconnaissance would likely have been performed before or during the exploitation phase, not only after.

### Final Answer: B: No
