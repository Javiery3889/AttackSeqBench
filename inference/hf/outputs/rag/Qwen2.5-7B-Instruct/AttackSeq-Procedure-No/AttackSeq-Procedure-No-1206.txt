Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the attacker has compromised SolarWinds and delivered the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access. It then asks whether the Sunburst backdoor is likely to communicate with its C2 server using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS to obfuscate the true destination of network traffic.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access to a network.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using domain fronting to disguise the true destination of network traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1071.004-DNS**: This technique is about using DNS to obfuscate the destination, but it does not necessarily disguise the true destination in a way that domain fronting does.
- **Technique T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique is about gaining initial access, which is already described in the question.
- **Technique T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique is specifically about disguising the true destination of network traffic, which aligns with the question's query about using domain fronting to disguise the C2 server's destination.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already gained initial access through a supply-chain attack and has deployed the Sunburst backdoor.
- The question then asks if the backdoor is likely to use domain fronting to disguise the C2 server's destination.
- Domain fronting (T1090.004) is a technique specifically designed to disguise the true destination of network traffic, which aligns perfectly with the question's query.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
