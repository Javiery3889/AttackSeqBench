Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via Tropic Trooper exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
2. Use of a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
3. Dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) via the system configuration file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
  - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This aligns with the initial access via exploiting a vulnerability.
  - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This aligns with the use of a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a backdoor into dllhost.exe.
  - The sequence of injecting a backdoor and then dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) is a common tactic in maintaining persistence and further compromising the system.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.
  - However, the related TTPs do not contradict the described sequence; they support it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access via exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) is a common technique in T1203.
- The use of a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a backdoor into dllhost.exe is a common persistence technique (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading).
- Dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) is a method to further compromise the system and maintain persistence.

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
