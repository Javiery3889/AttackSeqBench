Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Higaisa APT group:
1. Distributes malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results via spear-phishing.
2. Compromises legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using malicious links in spear-phishing emails to gain initial access to a system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of software to deliver malicious updates.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the scenario described in the question. The Higaisa APT group is using spear-phishing (T1566.002) to gain initial access and then compromising the software supply chain (T1195.002) to deliver a backdoor.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the scenario described in the question. It would imply that the Higaisa APT group is not using both techniques, which contradicts the described attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the APT group first uses spear-phishing to gain initial access and then uses the compromised software supply chain to deliver a backdoor.
- The related TTPs confirm that both techniques (spear-phishing and compromising the software supply chain) are valid and commonly used by APT groups.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes both techniques.

**Final Answer: Yes**
