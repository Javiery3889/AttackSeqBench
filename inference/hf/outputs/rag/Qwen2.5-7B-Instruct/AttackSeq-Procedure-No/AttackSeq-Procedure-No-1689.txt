Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. The attack evaded detection.
2. Legitimate tools and scripts were used for operations.
3. A PDF attachment was sent that passed through security filters and appeared benign.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1036-Masquerading

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making malicious content appear legitimate or benign. This aligns with the part of the question where a PDF attachment was sent that passed through security filters and appeared benign.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid being detected or investigated by defensive measures. This aligns with the part of the question where the attack evaded detection.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Legitimate Tools and Scripts**: The use of legitimate tools and scripts for operations is a common tactic in sophisticated attacks to avoid detection. This aligns with the tactic of Defense Evasion.
2. **PDF Attachment**: The PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign is a specific example of the T1036-Masquerading technique. This is a clear example of how the attack evaded detection by making the malicious content appear legitimate.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the use of legitimate tools and scripts (Defense Evasion) and the use of a benign-looking PDF attachment (T1036-Masquerading).

### Final Answer: A: Yes
