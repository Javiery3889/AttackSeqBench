Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Yellow Garuda collects various types of data from victims' Telegram accounts using a 'grabber' tool. The question then asks whether this data is likely to be divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration. It does not directly address the size of the data being exfiltrated.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves splitting data into smaller chunks to avoid detection by network monitoring systems. This is directly related to the question of dividing data into fixed-size chunks to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, which explicitly mentions splitting data into smaller chunks to evade detection.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, as it does not mention any strategy to evade detection by splitting data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the likelihood of dividing data into fixed-size chunks to evade detection.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, directly address the strategy of splitting data to avoid detection.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the one that includes the technique of splitting data into smaller chunks to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A**
