Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after a backdoor program has established communication with a C2 server using DNS tunneling. It asks whether the backdoor is likely to parse the returned data, extract commands from the C2 server, and then gather host information during the discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
- **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**

T1071.004-DNS is a specific technique under the Command and Control tactic that involves using DNS for data exfiltration or command and control communication. This technique is commonly used by attackers to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - If the backdoor uses DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server, it is logical that it would parse the returned data to extract commands from the C2 server. After receiving commands, the backdoor would then proceed to gather host information as part of the discovery phase.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the backdoor does not parse the returned data to extract commands and instead skips directly to gathering host information. This is less likely because the primary purpose of establishing communication with the C2 server is to receive commands and instructions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor program has established communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling, which is a method of Command and Control.
- DNS tunneling is used to exfiltrate data or receive commands from the C2 server.
- After receiving data from the C2 server, the backdoor is likely to parse this data to extract commands.
- Once commands are extracted, the backdoor would then proceed to gather host information as part of the discovery phase.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will parse the returned data, extract commands, and then gather host information.

**Final Answer: A**
