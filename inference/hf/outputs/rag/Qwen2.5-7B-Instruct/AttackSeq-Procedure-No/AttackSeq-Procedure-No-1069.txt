Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.
2. Executing the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.
3. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to gain elevated privileges.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process, often through a side-loading mechanism.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique is similar to the one mentioned in the question and involves injecting a malicious DLL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Tropic Trooper would follow the sequence described in the question.
  - The sequence involves injecting a malicious DLL, using a loader to launch the process, and then exploiting Equation Editor to execute an installer package.
  - This aligns with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs, particularly the use of DLL injection and side-loading.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Tropic Trooper would not follow the sequence described in the question.
  - There is no clear indication in the related TTPs that Tropic Trooper would not use such a sequence, and the techniques described are consistent with the actions outlined.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve injecting a malicious DLL, using a loader, and exploiting Equation Editor.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of DLL injection and side-loading techniques, which are consistent with the actions described.
- There is no indication in the related TTPs that Tropic Trooper would not follow this sequence.

### Final Answer: Yes
