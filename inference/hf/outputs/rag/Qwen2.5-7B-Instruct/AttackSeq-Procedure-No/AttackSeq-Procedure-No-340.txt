### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Nemesis bootkit has achieved persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
   - The question then asks whether the malware is likely to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions:** This technique involves the attacker placing files in directories that are excluded from scanning, which is a common method to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique involves the use of a bootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection by operating at a low level, such as the VBR.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique is similar to the above and involves using a bootkit to ensure the malware remains active even after a system reboot.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The Nemesis bootkit, as described, is already using a bootkit to achieve persistence by infecting the VBR. This indicates a high level of stealth and evasion.
   - Given the bootkit's nature, it is highly likely that the malware would employ additional evasion techniques to further avoid detection. Placing install files in directories that are excluded from scanning is a common and effective method to evade detection by security software.
