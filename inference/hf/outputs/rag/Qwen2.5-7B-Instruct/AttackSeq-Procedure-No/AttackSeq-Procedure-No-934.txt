### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT, including deploying malware components like downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the APT will maintain persistence by replacing the `pam_unix.so` file with a malicious version.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves modifying or replacing pluggable authentication modules to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique is similar to the persistence technique but focuses on evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking the dynamic linker to load malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about replacing the `pam_unix.so` file, which is a pluggable authentication module.
   - The related TTPs mention `T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules`, which directly aligns with the question's focus on modifying `pam_unix.so`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the `pam_unix.so` file is a pluggable authentication module and the related TTPs explicitly mention techniques for modifying such modules, it is highly plausible that the Darkhotel APT would use this method to maintain persistence.
   - The technique `T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules` is directly relevant and aligns with the described action of replacing the `pam_unix.so` file.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
