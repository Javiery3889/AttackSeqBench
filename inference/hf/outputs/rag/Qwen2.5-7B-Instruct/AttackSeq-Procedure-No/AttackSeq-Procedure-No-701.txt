Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spear-phishing emails are used as the primary attack vector to gain initial access.
2. Custom-built backdoors and RATs are used during resource development.
3. Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, are used to execute payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This confirms that the initial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This indicates that custom-built backdoors and RATs are used during the resource development phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It confirms that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing, custom-built backdoors and RATs are used during resource development, and environment-based evasion techniques are employed to execute the payloads.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs does not follow the described order, which contradicts the question's premise.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question clearly states that the attack sequence involves spear-phishing for initial access, followed by the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development, and the use of environment-based evasion techniques to execute the payloads.
- The related TTPs confirm that spear-phishing (T1566) is used for initial access and custom-built malware (T1587.001) is used for resource development.
- The sequence described in the question is consistent with the TTPs provided.

### Final Answer: Yes
