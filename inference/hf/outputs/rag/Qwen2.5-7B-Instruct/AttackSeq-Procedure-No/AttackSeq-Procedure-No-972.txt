Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of a final payload that establishes a remote command shell.
2. Communication with a command and control (C2) server.
3. Exfiltration of data over the same channel used for C2.
4. Configuration of systems for exfiltration by creating a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This technique involves using the same channel (e.g., a C2 server) to exfiltrate data. This aligns with the first part of the question where data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2.
- **Creating a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder**: This is a technique to hide files and directories, which is typically used to avoid detection rather than to exfiltrate data. It is more related to data hiding and persistence rather than exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it is likely that the APT group will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2 before configuring systems for exfiltration by creating a desktop.ini file.
- The related TTPs specifically mention exfiltration over the C2 channel, which directly supports the first part of the question.
- The creation of a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder is a separate technique used for data hiding and persistence, not for exfiltration.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the APT group will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2 before configuring systems for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
