Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers:
1. Parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts.
2. Acquired infrastructure only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains**: This technique involves the attacker parking domains for future use.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves the attacker compromising a software update to gain initial access to a system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (Initial Access)**: This is the initial vector used to gain access to the system.
- **Technique T1584.001-Domains (Resource Development)**: This is a technique used to acquire infrastructure for future use.

The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers first use a compromised software update (T1195) to gain initial access, and then park domains (T1584.001) for future use. This aligns with the Resource Development tactic, where the attackers are preparing infrastructure for future operations.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers use a compromised software update (T1195) to gain initial access to the system.
2. After gaining initial access, they proceed to park domains (T1584.001) for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts.

Given this sequence, the attackers are indeed likely to have parked domains for future use after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.

### Final Answer: A
