Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Lateral movement using the `net use` command.
2. Confirmation of communication with the target device via a ping command.
3. Use of compromised legitimate websites as C2 (Command and Control) servers for communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1083)**
  - **Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to establish or maintain a C2 channel.
- **Tactic: Discovery (T1043)**
  - **Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering internet connections to establish a C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after lateral movement and using the `net use` command, the attacker would confirm communication with the target device via a ping command and then use compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers.
  - This sequence aligns with the techniques mentioned:
    - **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: The attacker would likely use this technique to discover internet connections.
    - **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: After confirming the internet connection, the attacker would use traffic signaling to establish a C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attacker would not follow the described sequence.
  - This does not align with the techniques mentioned, as it skips the steps of confirming the internet connection and using traffic signaling.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question (lateral movement, confirmation via ping, and then using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers) aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1016.001 and T1205.
- The attacker would first confirm the internet connection (T1016.001) and then use traffic signaling (T1205) to establish a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A**
