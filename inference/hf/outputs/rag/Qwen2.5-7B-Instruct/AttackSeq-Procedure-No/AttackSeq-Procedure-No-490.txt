Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.
2. Collecting system information.
3. Probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links**: This aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique, which is a method of initial access where the attacker uses a malicious link in a phishing email to deliver a payload.
- **Collecting system information and probing files**: These actions are part of the Discovery phase, where the attacker gathers information about the target environment to understand its structure and identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions stealing application access tokens via phishing emails, which is a method of initial access.
2. **Phishing Emails with Malicious Links**: The T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique fits this description perfectly.
3. **Discovery Phase**: After gaining initial access, the attacker proceeds to collect system information and probe files, which are typical actions in the Discovery phase.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
