Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro is used to gain initial access.
2. The malware then establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.
3. After the scheduled task, the VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious script or executable at a later time.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic** - This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. The malware first gains initial access via a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document and an auto-open VBA macro. Then, it establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. Finally, the VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions. It would imply that the malware does not follow the steps outlined in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common technique used by malware to gain initial access and establish persistence.
- The related TTPs (T1053.005-Scheduled Task and T1059.005-Visual Basic) directly support the actions described in the question.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
