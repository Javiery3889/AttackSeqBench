Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where 'stopedge.bat' is used to delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a form of defense evasion.
   - It then asks if it is likely that persistence will be established using kernel modules, specifically mentioning techniques employed by Drovorub or Skidmap.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions:** This technique involves using kernel modules to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of persistence being established using kernel modules after the initial defense evasion technique.
   - Drovorub and Skidmap are known for their use of kernel modules for persistence, which aligns with T1547.006.
   - The deletion of files (as described by T1070.004) is a common tactic to evade detection, which is a precursor to establishing persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step of deleting files (T1070.004) is a common technique to evade detection.
   - After evading detection, the next logical step is to establish persistence.
   - Kernel modules (T1547.006) are a robust method for maintaining persistence, which aligns with the techniques used by Drovorub and Skidmap.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that after evading detection by deleting files, the next step would be to establish persistence using kernel modules.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that persistence will be established using kernel modules.

Final Answer: A: Yes
