### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials only after relying on Tor for anonymous communication during their command and control phase.
   - The key points are:
     - Stolen credentials are transmitted to C2 servers.
     - Tor is used for anonymous communication.
     - The question is about the sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) used by FIN4.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the transmission of stolen credentials.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves the use of DNS for C2 communication, which is a common method for maintaining command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:**
     - This technique involves the use of multi-hop proxies for C2 communication, which can provide additional layers of anonymity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after using Tor for anonymous communication, FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting credentials.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that FIN4 would use Tor for initial communication and then use C2 servers for further actions, such as credential collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN4 does not use C2 servers for collecting credentials after using Tor for anonymous communication.
     - This is less plausible because the use of Tor for initial communication does not preclude the use of C2 servers for further actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
