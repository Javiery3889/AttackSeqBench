Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
2. Downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
3. Executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.003-Cron
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exploiting CVE-2017-9841**: This is a known vulnerability that can be used to gain initial access. This is a common TTP in many malware campaigns.
- **Downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence**: The TTP "T1053.003-Cron" is related to using cron jobs for persistence. This is a common method to ensure the malware remains active on the system.
- **Executing Perl scripts and shell commands**: This is a form of execution, which aligns with the TTP "T1053.003-Cron" as it involves running commands.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 is a valid method to gain initial access.
2. **Persistence**: Downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence is a plausible method. The TTP "T1053.003-Cron" supports this.
3. **Execution**: Executing Perl scripts and shell commands is a form of execution, which is also supported by the TTP "T1053.003-Cron".

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
