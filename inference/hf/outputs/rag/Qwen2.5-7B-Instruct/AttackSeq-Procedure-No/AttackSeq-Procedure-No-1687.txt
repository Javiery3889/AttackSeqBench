Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Uploading credentials to an external FTP server.
2. Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.
3. Persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access to the network or system.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: Yes**
  - This option suggests that the Phantom Menace attackers would follow the described sequence of actions.
  - **Persistence (T1078-Valid Accounts)**: Configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity aligns with persistence techniques.
  - **Credential Access (T1555-Credentials from Password Stores)**: Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores is a direct application of this technique.
  - The sequence of actions described in the question fits well with the related TTPs.

- **Option B: No**
  - This option suggests that the Phantom Menace attackers would not follow the described sequence of actions.
  - Given the related TTPs, this option does not align with the described sequence, as it does not account for the persistence and credential access techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that aligns with the related TTPs.
- The attackers first upload credentials to an external FTP server, which is a form of credential access.
- They then use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores, which is a direct application of the T1555 technique.
- Finally, they persist by configuring applications to run batch files every hour, which is a form of persistence.
- All these actions are consistent with the related TTPs provided.

**Final Answer: A**
