Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that UNC2452 used Discovery techniques (specifically querying the registry and identifying running processes) after using Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control (C2) communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1071-Application Layer Protocol)**: This tactic involves the use of application layer protocols for C2 communications. This is the initial step mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery (T1057-Process Discovery)**: This tactic involves identifying running processes on the target system, which is one of the specific techniques mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after using Application Layer Protocol for C2 communications, UNC2452 then used Discovery techniques such as querying the registry and identifying running processes.
  - This sequence makes logical sense because after establishing a C2 channel, an attacker would likely want to gather more information about the target system to understand its environment and capabilities.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that UNC2452 did not use Discovery techniques after using Application Layer Protocol for C2 communications.
  - This would imply that the attacker did not gather additional information about the target system after establishing the C2 channel, which is less likely given the nature of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like UNC2452.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question mentions that UNC2452 used Application Layer Protocol for C2 communications. This is a common initial step in many APTs.
- **Step 2**: After establishing the C2 channel, the next logical step would be to gather information about the target system to understand its environment and capabilities. This is where Discovery techniques come into play.
- **Step 3**: The related TTPs specifically mention T1057-Process Discovery, which aligns with the question's mention of identifying running processes.
- **Step 4**: Querying the registry is also a common Discovery technique used to gather detailed information about the target system.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that UNC2452 used Application Layer Protocol for C2 communications and then employed Discovery techniques such as querying the registry and identifying running processes.

### Final Answer: Yes
