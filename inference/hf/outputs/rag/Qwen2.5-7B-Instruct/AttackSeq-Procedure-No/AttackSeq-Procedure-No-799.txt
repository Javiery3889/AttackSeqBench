Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Transmit stolen credentials to C2 servers.
2. Use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials.
3. Label the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a link in a spearphishing email, which is not directly related to the question as it mentions VBA macros.
- **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros, which aligns with the question's mention of embedded VBA macros.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment in a spearphishing email, which is also not directly related to the question as it mentions VBA macros.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of VBA macros in spearphishing emails, which is directly supported by the TTP T1059.005-Visual Basic.
  - The question also mentions labeling stolen credentials with unique 'campaign codes', which is a common practice in cyber operations to track and manage different campaigns.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the use of VBA macros in spearphishing emails, which is a key element of the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions involving the use of VBA macros in spearphishing emails.
- The related TTP T1059.005-Visual Basic directly supports the use of VBA macros in spearphishing emails.
- The labeling of stolen credentials with unique 'campaign codes' is a common practice in cyber operations and aligns with the described sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
