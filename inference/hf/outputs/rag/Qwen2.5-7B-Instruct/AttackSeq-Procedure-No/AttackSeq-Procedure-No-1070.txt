Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
2. Dropping RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity.
3. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate the attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to execute the payload. This aligns with the third step in the sequence described in the question, where a malicious DLL is injected into `dllhost.exe`.

- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used by attackers to avoid detection or analysis. While this is a broader category, it can encompass the actions described, such as using Equation Editor exploits and dropping RegAsm.exe.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves multiple steps, including the use of exploits, dropping a tool (RegAsm.exe), and then injecting a malicious DLL into a process.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection, directly align with the third step of the sequence.
- The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to perform these actions, and based on the provided TTPs, the sequence described is plausible.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
