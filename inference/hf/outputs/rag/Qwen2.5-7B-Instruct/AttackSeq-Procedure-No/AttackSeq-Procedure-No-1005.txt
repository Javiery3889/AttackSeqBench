Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a group has already used stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems. The next step in the sequence is whether the group will deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems or networks.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying network services and their associated protocols and versions.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the group will conduct vulnerability scanning before deploying public exploits. This aligns with the related TTPs, as vulnerability scanning (T1595.002) is a common step in identifying exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the group will deploy public exploits without conducting vulnerability scanning. This does not align with the related TTPs, as it skips a crucial step in the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the group has already compromised systems using stolen credentials. The next logical step would be to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in those systems.
- The related TTPs specifically mention vulnerability scanning (T1595.002) and network service discovery (T1046), which are essential steps in identifying exploitable vulnerabilities.
- Conducting vulnerability scanning is a standard practice in cyber attacks to ensure that the group is targeting known vulnerabilities before deploying exploits.

### Final Answer: Yes
