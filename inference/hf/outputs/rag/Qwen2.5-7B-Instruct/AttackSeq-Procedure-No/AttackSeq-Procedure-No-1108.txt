Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke has collected data using keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing during the Collection phase. The question then asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate this data over the same channel used for Command and Control (C2) communication during the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique specifically refers to using the same channel (e.g., a C2 channel) for exfiltrating data. This directly aligns with the question's scenario of exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: CosmicDuke has already established a C2 channel for communication with the attacker.
- **Step 2**: The related TTPs indicate that using the same channel for exfiltration is a common practice.
- **Step 3**: Given that CosmicDuke has already established a C2 channel, it is highly plausible that they would use the same channel for exfiltrating the collected data.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that CosmicDuke would indeed use the same channel for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
