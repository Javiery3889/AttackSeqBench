Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by FoggyWeb:
1. Downloading additional components from a C2 server.
2. Exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.
3. Monitoring HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves passively monitoring network traffic to discover information.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration of Data**: The question mentions exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates. This aligns with the **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**.
- **Monitoring Network Traffic**: The question also mentions monitoring HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns. This aligns with the **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**.
- **Command and Control**: The downloading of additional components from a C2 server aligns with the **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exfiltration**: FoggyWeb is likely to exfiltrate the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates, which is a form of data collection.
2. **Command and Control**: FoggyWeb will download additional components from a C2 server, which is a form of command and control.
3. **Monitoring**: After exfiltrating the necessary data, FoggyWeb will monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns, which is a form of network sniffing.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
