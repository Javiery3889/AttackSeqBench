Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in a cyber attack:
     1. Persistence is achieved by adding script paths to the task scheduler.
     2. Multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, are created.
     3. Social engineering is used to trick victims into enabling macros in malicious documents.
     4. The payload is activated through the enabled macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves adding script paths to the task scheduler to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique also involves scheduled tasks for execution, which aligns with the persistence technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will create multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, only after using social engineering in malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros for payload activation.
   - The related TTPs confirm that the use of scheduled tasks for persistence and execution is a common technique in cyber attacks.
   - Social engineering through malicious documents to enable macros is a well-known method to execute payloads, often leading to the creation of additional files like PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence described in the question aligns with the use of social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros.
   - After enabling macros, the attacker likely uses scheduled tasks to persist and execute the payload.
   - The creation of multiple files, such as PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, is a common tactic to evade detection and ensure the payload is executed.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs supports the likelihood of the campaign creating multiple files after using social engineering in malicious documents.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
