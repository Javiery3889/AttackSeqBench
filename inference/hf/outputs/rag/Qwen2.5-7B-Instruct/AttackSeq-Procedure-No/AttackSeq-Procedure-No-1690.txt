Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence:
1. Sending a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign.
2. Abusing the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC while elevating privileges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack:
- **T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to escalate privileges.
- **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves exploiting mechanisms designed to elevate privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The attack sequence described in the question aligns with the TTPs provided.
  - Sending a benign PDF attachment that bypasses security filters is a common method to evade initial detection.
  - Abusing the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC and elevate privileges is a specific technique that fits the TTPs related to privilege escalation.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the attack sequence does not align with the provided TTPs, which is not the case based on the information given.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the question involves sending a benign PDF attachment to bypass security filters, which is a common method to evade initial detection.
- The subsequent step of using the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC and elevate privileges is a specific technique that aligns with the TTPs provided.
- Both of these steps are consistent with the TTPs related to privilege escalation and defense evasion.

### Final Answer: Yes
