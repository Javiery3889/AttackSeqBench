Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file.
2. Accessing and downloading information stored in SharePoint instances.
3. Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery** is a technique that involves gathering information about the target's environment, such as the operating system version, hardware, and software configurations. This aligns with the first step in the question, where the OS version is collected from `SystemVersion.plist`.

- The question then asks if Smooth Operator is likely to access and download information stored in SharePoint instances. This step is not directly covered by the provided TTPs, as T1082 focuses on system information discovery rather than specific application data.

- The final step involves HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers, which is a common TTP in many cyber attacks but is not directly related to the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The provided TTPs (T1082-System Information Discovery) only cover the first step of the sequence, which is collecting the OS version.
- The question then asks about accessing and downloading information from SharePoint instances, which is not covered by the provided TTPs.
- Given the information provided, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not align well with the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No

The provided TTPs do not support the second step of the sequence (accessing and downloading information from SharePoint instances). Therefore, based on the given information, the most plausible answer is "No."
