### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with initial access via malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers would use the Microsoft Graph API to perform actions across Azure and M365 environments and subsequently disable security controls.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves attackers using cloud accounts to evade detection or maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves attackers escalating privileges using cloud accounts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves attackers gaining initial access to a system using cloud accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attackers are using cloud accounts to perform actions, which aligns with the use of the Microsoft Graph API to interact with Azure and M365 environments.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (initial access, then leveraging cloud accounts to perform actions, and finally evading or disabling security controls) is a plausible and common attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, it is highly likely that the attackers would use the Microsoft Graph API to perform actions across Azure and M365 environments and then disable security controls.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the answer choice that indicates a positive likelihood.

**Final Answer: A**
