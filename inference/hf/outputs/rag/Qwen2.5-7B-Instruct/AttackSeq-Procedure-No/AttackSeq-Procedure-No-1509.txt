### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike to map the network and collect administrative credentials after compromising a Domain Administrator's credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** The Carbanak group likely used compromised credentials (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** Once inside, they would use the same compromised credentials to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** They would then escalate their privileges to gain administrative access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A (Yes):** This aligns with the Carbanak group's known tactics. They typically use compromised credentials to gain initial access, then map the network and escalate privileges to collect administrative credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B (No):** This would imply that the group did not follow a common sequence of actions, which is less likely given their known methods.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: Yes
