### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Infamous Chisel, including Command and Control (C2) functionalities such as SCP, local Socks connection, and an SSH server/client.
   - The question then asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to perform discovery activities, specifically enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network using the `netd` component.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Tactic of "Discovery" and include:
     - T1018-Remote System Discovery
     - T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
     - T1046-Network Service Discovery
   - These techniques are all related to gathering information about the target environment, which aligns with the concept of discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel is likely to perform the described discovery activities.
     - Given the related TTPs, which are all focused on discovery, it is plausible that Infamous Chisel would engage in these activities to gather information about the target environment.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel is unlikely to perform the described discovery activities.
     - There is no direct evidence in the related TTPs that would suggest Infamous Chisel would not perform these activities, and the related TTPs all support the idea of discovery.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the related TTPs, which are all focused on discovery activities. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
