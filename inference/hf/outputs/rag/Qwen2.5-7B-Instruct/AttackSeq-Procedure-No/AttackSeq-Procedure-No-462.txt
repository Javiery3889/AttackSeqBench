### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Phosphorus group first employs OS credential dumping via LOLBIN techniques under the Credential Access tactic.
   - It then asks if the group is likely to collect files from a user’s OneDrive to steal browser data and keylogging information during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which is relevant to the browser data mentioned in the question.
   - **T1552.001-Credentials In Files:** This technique involves stealing credentials stored in files, which is relevant to the files from OneDrive mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks about collecting files from a user’s OneDrive to steal browser data and keylogging information.
   - **T1552.001-Credentials In Files** directly relates to collecting credentials from files, which could include files from OneDrive.
   - **T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers** relates to stealing credentials from web browsers, which could be part of the browser data mentioned.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs, the Phosphorus group is likely to use T1552.001 to collect credentials from files (including OneDrive) and T1555.003 to steal credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the question's description of collecting files from OneDrive to steal browser data.
   - Keylogging information is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible additional step in the collection phase.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: A: Yes
