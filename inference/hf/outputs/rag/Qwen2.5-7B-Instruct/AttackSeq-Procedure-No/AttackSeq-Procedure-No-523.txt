Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Delivery of a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
2. Execution of a PowerShell script named 'fmx.ps1'.
3. Downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.
4. Decoding and executing a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the execution of 'fmx.ps1'.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.
  - The use of a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') for execution (T1059.001) is consistent with the related TTPs.
  - The downloading of a zip file containing components for the malware payload and the decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script ('sdmc.jpg') are also consistent with the related TTPs (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not plausible.
  - However, the related TTPs do not contradict the described sequence; they support it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.
- The use of a PowerShell script for execution and the subsequent actions of downloading, decoding, and executing a base64 encoded script are consistent with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: Yes**
