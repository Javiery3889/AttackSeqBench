Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk.
2. Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process.
3. Using compromised residential endpoints, typically within the same ISP IP address range, as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic through a third party to hide the true source of the traffic.
- **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) to avoid detection.
- **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This is a sub-technique of T1090, specifically focusing on using external proxies.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1090-Proxy**: This technique aligns with the use of compromised residential endpoints as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic.
- **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is broader and focuses on hiding the infrastructure, which is not directly related to the use of proxies.
- **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This sub-technique is a specific instance of using external proxies, which aligns with the use of compromised residential endpoints.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes using compromised residential endpoints as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic.
2. The related TTPs include T1090-Proxy, T1665-Hide Infrastructure, and T1090.002-External Proxy.
3. T1090-Proxy and T1090.002-External Proxy are directly related to the use of proxies, while T1665-Hide Infrastructure is more general and not specifically about proxies.
4. T1090.002-External Proxy is a sub-technique of T1090-Proxy and is more specific to the use of external proxies, which aligns with the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes

The use of compromised residential endpoints as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic is a plausible and specific TTP that aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1090.002-External Proxy.
