Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Gamaredon:
1. Using backdoors to list interesting files, such as Office documents.
2. Collecting files from various information repositories.
3. Automatically uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a target to an external location, such as a C&C server.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves the automated gathering of data from various sources.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves identifying files and directories of interest.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This is the initial step where Gamaredon uses backdoors to list interesting files.
- **Technique T1119-Automated Collection**: This is the next step where files are collected from various information repositories.
- **Technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This is the final step where the collected files are uploaded to the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **File and Directory Discovery (T1083)**: Gamaredon uses backdoors to list interesting files, such as Office documents.
2. **Automated Collection (T1119)**: After identifying the files, Gamaredon collects these files from various information repositories.
3. **Automated Exfiltration (T1020)**: Finally, the collected files are automatically uploaded to the C&C server.

Given this sequence, the most plausible answer is that Gamaredon is likely to collect files from various information repositories before automatically uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A
