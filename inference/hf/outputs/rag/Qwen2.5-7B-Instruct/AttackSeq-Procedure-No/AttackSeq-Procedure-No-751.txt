Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
2. Fetching computer name and user name information.
3. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. This aligns with the HTTP POST requests mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections, which is not directly relevant to the question but provides context.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves ensuring persistence by placing a binary in the startup folder, which aligns with the question's mention of downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial communication (HTTP POST requests), the Rising Sun implant fetches computer name and user name information, and then ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  - This sequence aligns with the described TTPs:
    - T1071.001 (Web Protocols) for the initial communication.
    - T1016.001 (Internet Connection Discovery) is not directly relevant but can be inferred as part of the broader command and control process.
    - T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) for ensuring persistence.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions is different or does not follow the described TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the Rising Sun implant first communicates with control servers, then fetches information, and finally ensures persistence.
- The related TTPs support this sequence:
  - T1071.001 for the initial communication.
  - T1016.001 is not directly relevant but can be inferred as part of the broader command and control process.
  - T1547.001 for ensuring persistence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
