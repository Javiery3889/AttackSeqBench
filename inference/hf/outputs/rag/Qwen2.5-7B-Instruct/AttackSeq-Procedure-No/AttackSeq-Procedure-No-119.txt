Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
2. Delivery of DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
3. Execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.
4. Deployment of an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This is the first step in the attack sequence, which is correctly described as password spraying or brute-force attacks.
- **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001)**: This is the technique used to deliver the DanBot malware via malicious Excel attachments, which is also correctly described in the question.

Now, let's evaluate the remaining steps:
- **Execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`**: This step is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a common technique used to execute payloads or perform actions on the compromised system.
- **Deployment of an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware**: This step is also not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible follow-up action after executing arbitrary commands.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: LYCEUM uses password spraying or brute-force attacks to gain initial access.
2. **Spearphishing Attachment**: LYCEUM delivers DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
3. **Execution of Arbitrary Commands via `cmd.exe`**: After gaining access and delivering the malware, it is common for attackers to execute arbitrary commands to ensure the malware is running and to perform further actions.
4. **Deployment of an Obfuscated Macro Tool**: Once the arbitrary commands are executed, deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware is a logical next step to ensure persistence and further control over the compromised system.

Given the sequence and the common practices in cyber attacks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the provided answer choices.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
