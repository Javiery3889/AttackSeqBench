### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by VERMIN malware:
     1. Collects system information using WMI queries.
     - This aligns with the Tactic: Discovery and Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery.
   - The question then asks whether the malware will capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves the collection and staging of data locally, which could include system information, but does not directly address the capture of mouse movements or the storage of keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry, which is not directly related to the question about mouse movements or keystrokes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the initial part of the question about collecting system information using WMI queries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about a specific behavior (capturing mouse movements) that is not directly related to the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - The related TTPs focus on system information discovery and data staging, but do not provide information about the malware's behavior in capturing mouse movements or storing keystrokes and clipboard data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided, the question is asking about a specific behavior (mouse movement capture) that is not directly supported by the related TTPs. The related TTPs do not provide evidence to support either answer choice A or B definitively.
   - However, based on the context of the question and the typical behavior of malware, it is more plausible that VERMIN malware would capture mouse movements rather than storing keystrokes and clipboard data, as mouse movements can provide valuable information about user interactions and activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
