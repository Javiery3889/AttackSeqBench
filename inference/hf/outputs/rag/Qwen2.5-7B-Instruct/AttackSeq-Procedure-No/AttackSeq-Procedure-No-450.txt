Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where Agrius initially gains access via a public-facing application vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379). It then asks whether Agrius is likely to use pass the ticket for lateral movement and communicate with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This confirms that the initial access is indeed via exploiting a public-facing application.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the communication with C2 servers is likely to be over web protocols.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Agrius would use pass the ticket for lateral movement and communicate with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.
  - **Pass the Ticket (T1078)**: This technique involves using a ticket from a trusted user to gain access to resources. However, the question does not explicitly mention the use of pass the ticket for lateral movement.
  - **IPsec Helper Backdoor over HTTP**: This is a specific technique where the backdoor is used to establish a covert channel over HTTP. While this is a plausible technique, the question does not specify the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Agrius would not use pass the ticket for lateral movement and would not communicate with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.
  - Given the information provided, this choice is less specific and does not align as closely with the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs: initial access via a public-facing application vulnerability, followed by lateral movement and communication with C2 servers.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of web protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.
- The use of pass the ticket for lateral movement is not explicitly mentioned in the question, making it less certain.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
