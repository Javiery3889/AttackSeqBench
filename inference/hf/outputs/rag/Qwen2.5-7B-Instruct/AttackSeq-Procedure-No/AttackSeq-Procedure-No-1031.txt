Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use various methods (direct shell commands, Cobalt Strike features, and SSH) to propagate beacons to other systems within the network. The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the question's context of gathering Active Directory and network information.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves the development or use of tools to support the attack, which could include ADFind and port scanning tools.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - ADFind is a tool used to query Active Directory, which is directly related to the discovery of Active Directory information.
  - Port scanning is a common method to gather network information, which is also part of the discovery process.
  - Both ADFind and port scanning are techniques that align with the TTPs provided in the related list.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that after using the propagation methods mentioned, attackers would not use ADFind or port scanning for discovery, which does not align with common attacker behavior.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involve lateral movement within a network.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for remote system discovery and the use of tools to support the attack.
- ADFind and port scanning are both tools that are commonly used in the discovery phase of an attack to gather Active Directory and network information.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that attackers would use these tools as part of the discovery process.

**Final Answer: A**
