Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Employing Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access using Mimikatz PowerShell.
2. Extracting emails from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.
3. Determining if the Duke group is likely to log keystrokes on the victim’s machine.
4. Securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves logging keystrokes.
- **T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**: This technique involves extracting Kerberos tickets.
- **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique is mentioned again, indicating its importance.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**: This is directly related to the first part of the question, where Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks are used for credential access.
- **Technique T1056.001-Keylogging**: This is directly related to the third part of the question, where keystrokes are logged.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Kerberos Pass-the-Ticket Attacks (T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting)**: The question mentions using Mimikatz PowerShell for Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks, which aligns with the T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting technique.
2. **Extracting Emails (T1056.001-Keylogging)**: The question also mentions extracting emails from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials, which aligns with the T1056.001-Keylogging technique.
3. **Keystroke Logging (T1056.001-Keylogging)**: The question asks if the Duke group is likely to log keystrokes on the victim’s machine, which aligns with the T1056.001-Keylogging technique.
4. **Secure Communication (Base64 and RC4/AES)**: The question mentions securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption, which is a common method for secure communication in cyber attacks.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the Duke group would log keystrokes on the victim’s machine after extracting emails and before securely communicating with the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
