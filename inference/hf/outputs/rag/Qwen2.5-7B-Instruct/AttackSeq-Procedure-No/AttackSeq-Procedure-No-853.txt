Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions Dexphot using fileless techniques for defense evasion.
   - It then asks if Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing during the execution stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include "T1055.012-Process Hollowing" under both "Defense Evasion" and "Privilege Escalation" tactics.
   - This indicates that process hollowing is a technique that can be used in both defense evasion and privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about the use of process hollowing during the execution stage.
   - Process hollowing (T1055.012) is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process to execute it, which can be used for both defense evasion and privilege escalation.
   - Since the question does not specify whether the process hollowing is for defense evasion or privilege escalation, we need to consider the context of the execution stage.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Dexphot is known to use fileless techniques for defense evasion, which means it is trying to avoid detection and obfuscate its activities.
   - Process hollowing can be a method to execute malicious code without creating new processes, which aligns with the goal of avoiding detection.
   - During the execution stage, process hollowing can be used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, which can help in maintaining persistence and evading detection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Dexphot would use process hollowing during the execution stage to load executables into legitimate system processes, as this technique can help in evading detection and maintaining persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
