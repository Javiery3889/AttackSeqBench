Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker, specifically "FamousSparrow," after gaining initial access to a system through exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. The next steps in the sequence are:
1. Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
2. Acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is correctly described in the question, as the attacker has gained access through exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)**: This technique is also correctly described, as the attacker is exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.
- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not plausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker has successfully exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a network.
2. **Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor**: This is a plausible action after gaining initial access. The attacker would likely use a command-line interface to execute commands and download additional malware.
3. **Acquiring infrastructure for Resource Development**: After establishing a foothold and installing the backdoor, the attacker would need to acquire additional infrastructure to maintain control and develop resources for further operations.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the described sequence is plausible and aligns with typical attacker behavior.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
