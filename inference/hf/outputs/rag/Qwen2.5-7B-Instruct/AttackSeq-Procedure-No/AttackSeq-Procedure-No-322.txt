Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an app that collects various types of data from an iOS device and then performs routines. It asks whether the app is likely to use encryption for its C2 (Command and Control) channel before uploading files via FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for data exfiltration. It suggests that the C2 channel is used for communication between the compromised device and the attacker.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted protocol that is not a C2 channel. It implies that data can be exfiltrated over non-C2 protocols without encryption.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - If the app uses encryption for its C2 channel, it would be more secure and less likely to be detected by network monitoring tools. However, the question does not provide any specific information that would indicate the use of encryption.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - If the app does not use encryption for its C2 channel, it would be less secure and more likely to be detected by network monitoring tools. The related TTPs suggest that data can be exfiltrated over unencrypted protocols, which aligns with this answer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question does not provide any specific information about the use of encryption for the C2 channel.
- The related TTPs suggest that data can be exfiltrated over unencrypted protocols, which is consistent with the possibility that the app does not use encryption for its C2 channel.
- Given the lack of specific information about encryption use and the presence of TTPs that involve unencrypted exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that the app does not use encryption for its C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B**
