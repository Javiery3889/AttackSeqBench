Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails that lead to initial access through a spearphishing attachment. The specific file mentioned is 'Richard_Johnson.doc', and the question asks if the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to a system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment in a phishing email to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access via Spearphishing**: The question mentions that the campaign uses spearphishing to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
- **Exploiting CVE-2018-13379**: The question asks if the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access. However, the related TTPs do not directly mention exploiting a specific vulnerability in FortiOS devices. The T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application technique is more general and could potentially apply to various vulnerabilities, but it does not specifically mention CVE-2018-13379.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The campaign uses spearphishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
- The question asks if the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access. While the T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application technique is relevant, it does not specifically mention CVE-2018-13379 or FortiOS devices.
- Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the initial access via spearphishing, but there is no direct evidence to support the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

### Final Answer: B: No
