Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initiating command and control communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.
2. Surveying the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's system, which aligns with the second part of the question.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography, which aligns with the encryption method (AES in CBC mode) mentioned in the first part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. After establishing command and control communication (which includes encryption), the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to gather system information (as per the T1082-System Information Discovery technique).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions. If the backdoor is established and communicating, it would be logical for it to gather system information for further exploitation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where command and control communication is established using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.
- The related TTPs indicate that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to gather system information (T1082-System Information Discovery) as part of its operations.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor would indeed gather system information after establishing the command and control communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
