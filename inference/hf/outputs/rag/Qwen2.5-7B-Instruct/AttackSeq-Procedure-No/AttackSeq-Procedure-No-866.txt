Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering information about the victim's computer and environment.
2. Staging archives of collected data on the target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server.
3. Preparing the staged data for exfiltration by creating a file containing paths of all files to be exfiltrated.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data locally on the victim's system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data on a remote server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique aligns with the first part of the sequence, where data is gathered and staged locally.
- **Technique T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique aligns with the second part of the sequence, where data is staged on a remote server (in this case, the OWA server).

The question specifically mentions staging archives of collected data on the target's OWA server, which aligns with **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence described in the question and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. Local Data Staging (T1074.001)
2. Remote Data Staging (T1074.002)

Since the question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will perform the described actions, and the related TTPs support this sequence, the answer is affirmative.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
