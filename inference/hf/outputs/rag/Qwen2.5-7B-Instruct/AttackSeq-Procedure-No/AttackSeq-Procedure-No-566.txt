Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, before using a compromised software update (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise) as an initial access vector, attackers are likely to have leveraged legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malware or other malicious content.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This is a sub-technique of T1195, which specifically involves compromising the software supply chain to deliver malicious updates.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique focuses on the overall process of compromising a software supply chain. It does not explicitly mention the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
- **Technique T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This sub-technique is more specific and could involve various methods to compromise the software supply chain, including the use of legitimate credentials to gain access to systems and networks.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question is about the initial access vector, which is the first step in the attack lifecycle.
2. **Supply Chain Compromise**: The attackers are using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.
3. **Legitimate Credentials**: The question asks if attackers are likely to have used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before the supply chain compromise.
4. **Sub-Technique Analysis**: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain could involve various methods, including the use of legitimate credentials to gain access to systems and networks, which would be a plausible step before using a compromised software update.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that attackers could have used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services as part of their initial access strategy before leveraging the compromised software update.

Final Answer: A: Yes
