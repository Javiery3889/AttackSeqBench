Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`.
2. Extracting Chrome passwords for Credential Access by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`:** This is a method of collecting data, likely user keystrokes, which is a common technique for gathering sensitive information.
- **Extracting Chrome passwords for Credential Access using `libchrome.exe`:** This is a specific technique (T1555.003) that involves accessing and extracting credentials from web browsers, particularly Google Chrome.

Given that the question asks if it is likely that the spyware will perform the second step after the first, we need to consider if these steps logically follow each other and align with the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`:** This step is about collecting data, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Extracting Chrome passwords for Credential Access using `libchrome.exe`:** This step is about accessing and extracting specific credentials, which is a direct follow-up to collecting data, especially if the data includes login credentials.

The related TTPs, particularly T1555.003, directly support the idea of extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the second step in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes

The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided related TTPs. Therefore, it is likely that the spyware will extract Chrome passwords for Credential Access by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe` after performing keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`.
