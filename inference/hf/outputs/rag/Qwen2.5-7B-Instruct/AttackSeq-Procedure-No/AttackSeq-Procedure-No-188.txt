### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary uses scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations during the Collection phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automated exfiltration of data, which is not directly related to C2 but might be used in conjunction with C2.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols for C2 communication, which includes FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about the use of FTP for C2 communication.
   - The related TTPs mention FTP as a file transfer protocol, which can be used for C2 communication (T1071.002).
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest the use of web protocols (T1071.001) for C2, only that FTP is a relevant technique for C2.

### Final Answer:
Based on the related TTPs and the specific mention of FTP as a file transfer protocol for C2 communication, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use FTP for C2 communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
