Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information.
2. Dropping Elephant (a malware) to execute UPX-packed backdoors.
3. Downloading additional malware.
4. Using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via spear-phishing emails.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious document via spear-phishing emails.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Dropping Elephant and UPX-packed backdoors**: This part of the sequence is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as it involves deploying malware to gain a foothold.
- **Downloading additional malware**: This step is also plausible, as it is common for attackers to download and install additional malware to maintain persistence and gather more information.
- **Spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents**: This is directly mentioned in the related TTPs (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Targeting Victims**: This is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks.
2. **Dropping Elephant and UPX-packed backdoors**: This step is plausible but not directly supported by the related TTPs.
3. **Downloading additional malware**: This step is plausible and can be inferred from the context.
4. **Spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents**: This is directly supported by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the steps described in the question, with the spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents being the final step. The dropping of Elephant and UPX-packed backdoors, while plausible, are not directly supported by the related TTPs.

Final Answer: A
