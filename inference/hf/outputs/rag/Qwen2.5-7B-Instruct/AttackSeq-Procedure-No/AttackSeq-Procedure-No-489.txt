Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will:
1. Collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase.
2. Dump credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.
3. Perform these actions in a specific sequence: first, dump credentials, then collect system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as system configuration, network topology, and user information.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, such as through the use of Mimikatz.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1003 (OS Credential Dumping)**: This is a technique used in the Credential Access phase to obtain credentials from the compromised system.
- **Technique T1082 (System Information Discovery)**: This is a technique used in the Discovery phase to gather information about the system.

The question asks if it is likely that the actor will perform the following sequence:
1. Dump credentials (T1003).
2. Collect system information (T1082).

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is common for an attacker to first gain access to a system (which might involve dumping credentials) and then proceed to gather information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities. This sequence is logical and follows a typical attack pattern.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The actor first needs to gain access to the system, which often involves dumping credentials.
- **Step 2**: After gaining access, the actor will likely want to understand the system's environment, which involves collecting system information.
- **Step 3**: The sequence of actions (dumping credentials first, then collecting system information) is a logical and common approach in cyber attacks.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the actor will first dump credentials and then collect system information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
