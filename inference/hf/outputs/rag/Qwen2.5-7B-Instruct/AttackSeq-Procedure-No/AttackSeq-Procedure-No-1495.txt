Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves creating fake email accounts to obtain credentials.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves creating fake social media accounts to obtain credentials.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate entities to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram. This aligns with the techniques T1585.002 (Email Accounts) and T1585.001 (Social Media Accounts), which both involve creating fake accounts to obtain credentials.
   - The Reconnaissance phase involves gathering information, and the Resource Development phase involves using that information to create and maintain access.
   - The technique T1656-Impersonation supports the use of fake websites and accounts to impersonate legitimate entities, which is consistent with the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Charming Kitten's initial action (impersonating researchers or journalists) is part of the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The creation of fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram is a Resource Development activity.
   - The techniques T1585.002 and T1585.001 directly support the creation of fake accounts to obtain credentials.
   - The technique T1656-Impersonation supports the use of these fake websites and accounts.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the techniques and the phases, it is highly plausible that Charming Kitten would create fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
