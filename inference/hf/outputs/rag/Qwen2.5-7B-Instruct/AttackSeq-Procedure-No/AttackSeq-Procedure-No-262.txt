Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Malicious documents attached to emails execute embedded macros.
2. These macros download the Dridex loader.
3. The loader then creates and executes services to load its payload.
4. The loader employs RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Defense Evasion, T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation from files or information to make them functional or readable.
- **Defense Evasion, T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to prevent unauthorized access or analysis.
- **Defense Evasion, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make them difficult to understand or analyze.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The loader creates and executes services to load its payload, and then employs RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection. This sequence fits well with the related TTPs, particularly T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information and T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the loader did not employ RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection, it would not fit the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the Dridex loader, after being downloaded, creates and executes services to load its payload and then employs RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings.
- The related TTPs (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information and T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File) directly support the use of obfuscation and encryption techniques.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the only choice that aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
