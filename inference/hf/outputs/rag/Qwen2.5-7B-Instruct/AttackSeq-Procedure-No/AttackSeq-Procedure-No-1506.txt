Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by RIG EK:
1. **Proxy Servers**: Used to make infections harder to detect.
2. **Exploit Server**: Likely to use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same CDN for command and control operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using proxy servers to hide the true destination of network traffic.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using domain fronting to disguise the true destination of network traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of both proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) and domain fronting (T1090.004-Domain Fronting) for command and control operations.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that RIG EK does not use both techniques, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where RIG EK first uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, and then uses domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic for command and control operations.
- The related TTPs confirm that both techniques (proxy servers and domain fronting) are used in the context of command and control operations.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
