### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of the organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.003-Identify Business Tempo:** This technique involves identifying the business tempo of an organization, which can include understanding the organization's operations and supply chain.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007-Container API:** This technique involves using container APIs for credential access, which is relevant to the initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.002-Business Relationships:** This technique involves identifying and understanding the business relationships of the target organization, which can be crucial for tailoring attacks to specific supply chain relationships.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1591.002-Business Relationships, which directly involves gathering information about the organization's supply chain relationships.
     - Understanding the supply chain can help the attackers tailor their attack to specific vulnerabilities within the supply chain, making the attack more effective.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it suggests that the attackers would not gather information about the supply chain, which contradicts the techniques mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
