Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the T9000 malware:
1. Communicates with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol.
2. Captures data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft.
3. Evades detection by customizing its installation to avoid security products.
4. Ensures only one instance runs via mutexes and named events.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion**
  - This technique involves using mutual exclusion to ensure only one instance of a process runs at a time, which aligns with the question's mention of mutexes and named events.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the question's mention of an encrypted binary protocol.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes all the mentioned TTPs:
    - Communication with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol (T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol).
    - Capturing data from the victim's system (including Skype communications and file theft).
    - Evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid security products (implied by the overall evasion tactic).
    - Ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events (T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question, as it would imply that the malware does not perform the actions mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are consistent with the related TTPs.
- The answer choice "Yes" (A) correctly encompasses all the mentioned TTPs and aligns with the described sequence of actions.
- The answer choice "No" (B) does not align with the described sequence.

### Final Answer: Yes
