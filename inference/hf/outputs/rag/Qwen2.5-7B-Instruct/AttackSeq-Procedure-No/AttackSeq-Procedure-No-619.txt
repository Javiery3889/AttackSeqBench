Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where lightSpy malware uses hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration. It then asks if the malware is likely to first perform data collection by targeting specific types of information (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This TTP is about the method of data exfiltration, which is relevant to the question but not directly related to the initial data collection phase.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This TTP is specifically about collecting data from various sources, which aligns with the data collection phase described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware would first collect the specified types of data before exfiltrating it.
  - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1213-Data from Information Repositories, it is plausible that the malware would collect the mentioned data types as part of its initial collection phase.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware would not first collect the specified types of data.
  - This is less likely because the question implies that the malware is designed to gather specific types of data before exfiltrating it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware is leveraging hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.
- The related TTPs, especially T1213-Data from Information Repositories, indicate that the malware is designed to collect data from various sources.
- The question asks if the malware is likely to first perform data collection by targeting specific types of information, which aligns with the TTPs and the described scenario.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
