Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Establishing communication with a C&C server using an XOR-encrypted address.
2. Using the Waterbear backdoor.
3. Employing API hooking techniques to modify 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable'.
4. Masking processes and TCP endpoints only after loading incoming executables.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to execute code. While this is relevant, it doesn't directly address the API hooking and the specific APIs mentioned.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise. This is not directly related to the question's focus on API hooking and masking processes/TCP endpoints.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The Waterbear backdoor is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, including API hooking. The question mentions modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable', which are indeed native Windows APIs. These modifications can be used to mask processes and TCP endpoints, which aligns with the described behavior.
  - The sequence of actions (establishing communication, then using the backdoor to modify APIs) is plausible and consistent with known Waterbear behavior.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the Waterbear backdoor does not use API hooking for the described purposes. However, given the known capabilities of the Waterbear backdoor, this seems unlikely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Waterbear backdoor is known for its advanced evasion techniques, which include API hooking.
- The specific APIs mentioned ('ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable') are commonly targeted for such purposes.
- The sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the known behavior of the Waterbear backdoor.

**Final Answer: Yes**
