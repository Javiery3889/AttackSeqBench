### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where ZoxPNG (a malware) establishes contact with a C2 server via an HTTP GET request.
   - It then asks whether ZoxPNG will likely use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can be used for both command and control and for evading detection.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the initial HTTP GET request mentioned in the question.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic, which can be used for both command and control and for evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ZoxPNG will use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion.
     - The related TTPs (T1090-Proxy and T1090.002-External Proxy) indicate that using proxies for C2 communication and evasion is a common tactic.
     - The WinInet API is a common method for making HTTP requests in Windows, which aligns with the initial HTTP GET request mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ZoxPNG will not use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion.
     - While this is possible, the related TTPs do not provide any information that directly contradicts this choice. However, the context of the question and the related TTPs suggest that using proxies for evasion is a plausible tactic.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that ZoxPNG will likely use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
