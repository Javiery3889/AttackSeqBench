Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.
2. The Stager module notifying of successful exploitation.
3. Exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities.
4. Achieving privilege escalation using specific CVEs (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges within the compromised system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation after the entire sequence of actions, including exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities and achieving privilege escalation.
  - This aligns with the described sequence in the question, where the Stager module would only notify after all these steps are completed.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation at a different point in the sequence, which does not align with the described sequence in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions, including exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities and achieving privilege escalation.
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions are part of the attack sequence.
- The Stager module would logically notify of successful exploitation only after all these steps are completed, as it would need to confirm that the full sequence of actions has been successfully executed.

### Final Answer: Yes
