Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Iranian state-backed hackers used phishing attacks through email and social media accounts to gain initial access. The question then asks if it is likely that they scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization to tailor the attack.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses**: This technique involves gathering email addresses of potential targets.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Phishing (T1566)**: The initial access technique used by the hackers is phishing, which is described in the question.
- **Gathering Victim Org Information (T1591)**: This technique is related to gathering information about the victim organization, which could include IP addresses, but it is not specifically about scanning IP addresses.
- **Gathering Email Addresses (T1589.002)**: This technique is specifically about gathering email addresses, which aligns with the phishing attack described in the question.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the hackers used phishing to gain initial access and then likely gathered email addresses of specific targets. Scanning specific lists of target IP addresses is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and would be a separate step that is not explicitly supported by the given information.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the hackers did not scan specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach, but rather focused on phishing and gathering email addresses.

**Final Answer: B: No**
