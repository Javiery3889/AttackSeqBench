Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Rising Sun implant:
1. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
2. Collecting browser bookmark information as part of discovery.
3. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: This tactic involves the use of web protocols for command and control. The question mentions HTTP POST requests, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Tactic: Discovery (T1217-Browser Information Discovery)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the user, system, and network to understand the environment. The question mentions collecting browser bookmark information, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Ensuring persistence (downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder) is a common TTP for maintaining access.
  - Collecting browser bookmark information (T1217-Browser Information Discovery) is a form of discovery.
  - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a form of command and control.
  - This sequence logically follows the steps described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the Rising Sun implant does not perform the described actions, which contradicts the sequence provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question logically follows the steps of persistence, discovery, and command and control.
- The related TTPs (T1217-Browser Information Discovery and T1071.001-Web Protocols) support the actions mentioned in the question.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes all the described actions.

**Final Answer: A**
