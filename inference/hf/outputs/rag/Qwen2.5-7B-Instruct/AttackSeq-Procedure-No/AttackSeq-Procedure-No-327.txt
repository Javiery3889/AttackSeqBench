Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs during the Command and Control phase, including sending information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files.
   - It then asks if the app is likely to collect text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system itself, which is part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is also part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks about the Discovery phase, which is a phase where the malware would be gathering information about the victim's device.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to gather system information and discover files and directories, which are actions that could include collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Command and Control phase involves communication and data exfiltration.
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the victim's device, which can include sensitive data like text messages, contact lists, and location data.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that the malware is likely to perform these actions during the Discovery phase.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the app would collect text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
