Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique is directly related to the custom screenshot tool mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique is related to the use of file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of using FTP for C2 communication after the screenshot tool has been used.
   - The related TTPs do not directly link the screenshot tool to FTP for C2 communication. However, the question is asking about the likelihood of using FTP for C2 communication after the collection phase.
   - FTP is a common protocol used for file transfer, which aligns with the technique T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols. This technique can be used for various purposes, including C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The screenshot tool (T1113-Screen Capture) is part of the collection phase.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of using FTP for C2 communication after the collection phase.
   - FTP is a common protocol for file transfer, which can be used for C2 communication.
   - There is no direct evidence in the related TTPs that the screenshot tool specifically uses FTP for C2 communication, but the question is asking about the likelihood of using FTP for C2 communication in general.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that FTP is a common protocol for file transfer and can be used for C2 communication, it is plausible that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon might utilize FTP for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
