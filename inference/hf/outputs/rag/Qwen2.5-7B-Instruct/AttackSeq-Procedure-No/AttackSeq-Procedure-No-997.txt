### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: using a zero-day exploit to infect a target with Plexor malware, followed by the use of Longhorn's tools for system fingerprinting and discovery, and then avoiding detection.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying security software on the target system, which is a form of system fingerprinting.
   - **T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves monitoring user activity, which can be part of system discovery.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying files and directories on the target system, which is also a form of system discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities, followed by tactics to avoid detection.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that Longhorn's tools would engage in these activities as part of their espionage-focused malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Longhorn's tools will not perform these actions.
     - This is less plausible because the related TTPs clearly indicate that system fingerprinting and discovery are common activities in the context of espionage and malware operations.

### Final Answer:
