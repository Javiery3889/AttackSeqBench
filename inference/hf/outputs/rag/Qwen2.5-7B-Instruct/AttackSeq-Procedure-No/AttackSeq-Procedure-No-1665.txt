Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
2. Discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.
3. Execution using process hollowing to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about security software on the target system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing the memory of an existing process, and resuming the process to hide malicious activity.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing)**: The question mentions that the initial access is via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables, which aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique.
- **Discovery (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery)**: After gaining initial access, the malware TDrop2 would likely gather system information and network views to understand the environment. This aligns with the T1518.001-Security Software Discovery technique.
- **Execution (T1055.012-Process Hollowing)**: Finally, the malware would use process hollowing to perform execution and evade detection. This aligns with the T1055.012-Process Hollowing technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables, which is a T1566-Phishing technique.
2. After gaining initial access, the malware would likely gather system information and network views to understand the environment, which is a T1518.001-Security Software Discovery technique.
3. To perform execution and evade detection, the malware would use process hollowing, which is a T1055.012-Process Hollowing technique.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that TDrop2 would indeed engage in discovery activities before performing execution using process hollowing.

### Final Answer: A
