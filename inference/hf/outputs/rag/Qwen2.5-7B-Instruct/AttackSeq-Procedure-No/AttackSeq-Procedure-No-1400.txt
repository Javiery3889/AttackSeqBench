Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives.
2. Archiving the data locally or remotely.
3. Using DNS Calculation techniques.
4. Exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated methods of exfiltrating data.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This technique involves using DNS calculations to determine command and control (C2) ports.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a channel established for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the use of DNS Calculation techniques (T1568.003) before exfiltrating the data (T1041) over a web service (T1020).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that DNS Calculation is not used, which contradicts the question's description.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where DNS Calculation is used before exfiltrating data over web services.
- The related TTPs confirm that DNS Calculation (T1568.003) is a technique used in the Command and Control tactic, and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) is a technique used in the Exfiltration tactic.
- The sequence described in the question matches the sequence of TTPs provided in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
