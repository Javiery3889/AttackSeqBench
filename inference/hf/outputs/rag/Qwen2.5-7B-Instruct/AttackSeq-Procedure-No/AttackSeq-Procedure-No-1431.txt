Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Smooth Operator malware:
1. Automatically exfiltrating collected data via a second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.
2. Establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS.
3. Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **HTTP GET Request for Exfiltration**: The question mentions that the malware uses a HTTP GET request for exfiltration. This aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.
- **HTTPS for C2 Communication**: The question then asks if the malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS. This is consistent with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique, which involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Custom Data Encoding Algorithm**: The question also mentions the use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. While this is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a common practice in malware to obfuscate data to evade detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question (HTTP GET for exfiltration, then HTTPS for C2 communication, and custom data encoding) is a plausible and common sequence of actions for malware.
- The related TTPs support the use of web protocols for both exfiltration and C2 communication, which aligns with the question's scenario.
- The use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a common practice in malware, even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
