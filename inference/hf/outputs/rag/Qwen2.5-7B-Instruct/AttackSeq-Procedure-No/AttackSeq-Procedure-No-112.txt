Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after the discovery phase:
1. Attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.
2. They taint shared content to achieve lateral movement.
3. They install additional persistence points on new systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1080 - Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware or other malicious payloads.
- **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems to facilitate lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1080 - Taint Shared Content**: This technique directly aligns with the question's description of tainting shared content to achieve lateral movement.
- **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question. While it can be part of the overall strategy, it is not the immediate next step after tainting shared content.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Phase**: Attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data.
2. **Tainting Shared Content (T1080)**: This is the next logical step to achieve lateral movement. By tainting shared content, attackers can spread malware or other malicious payloads to other systems.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Once the shared content is tainted, the attackers can move laterally to other systems.
4. **Persistence Points (T1570)**: After achieving lateral movement, the attackers can then install persistence mechanisms on new systems to ensure long-term access.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Taint shared content (T1080) to achieve lateral movement, followed by installing persistence points on new systems.

### Final Answer: A
