Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting remote services for lateral movement.
2. Scanning for machines in the target's network environment.
3. Targeting user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This TTP aligns with the first part of the question, where the attacker is exploiting remote services for lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This TTP is related to the third part of the question, where the attacker is targeting user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Scanning for Machines (HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan)**: These tools are used for network reconnaissance, which is a precursor to lateral movement. However, the question does not explicitly mention scanning as a step in the sequence.
- **Exploiting Remote Services for Lateral Movement**: This is a clear step in the sequence.
- **Scanning for Machines**: This is a logical step that would follow the initial exploitation of remote services for lateral movement.
- **Targeting User Credentials**: This is the final step in the sequence, where the attacker uses tools like procdump and Mimikatz to access user credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence starts with exploiting remote services for lateral movement (T1210).
2. The next logical step would be to scan the network for machines (using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan).
3. After identifying potential targets, the attacker would then proceed to target user credentials (using tools like procdump and Mimikatz).

Given this sequence, the answer choices can be evaluated:
- **A: Yes**: This aligns with the logical sequence described in the question.
- **B: No**: This would imply that the scanning step is not necessary or that the sequence is incorrect.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
