Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Targeting individuals with phishing attacks and fake news organizations to gain initial access.
2. Clearing logs from `/var/logs` and `/Library/logs`.
3. Employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves using runtime packers and obfuscation to hide malicious code or data.
- **T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs**: This technique involves clearing system logs to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Packrat will perform all the actions described in the question.
  - Clearing logs (`T1070.002`) is a common tactic to evade detection.
  - Employing runtime packers and obfuscation (`T1027`) is also a common technique to bypass security measures.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Packrat will not perform the actions described in the question.
  - This would mean that Packrat does not clear logs or use obfuscation techniques, which contradicts the common practices of many threat actors.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question describes a sequence of actions that are typical in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.
- **Step 2**: The related TTPs confirm that clearing logs and using obfuscation are common techniques used by threat actors to evade detection and bypass security measures.
- **Step 3**: Given that both TTPs are relevant and commonly used, it is highly likely that Packrat would employ these techniques.

### Final Answer: Yes
