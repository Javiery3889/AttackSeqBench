Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compromise a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
2. Use Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.
3. Determine if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves using tools like Nmap to discover systems on a network.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves moving tools across the network to other systems.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using tools to deploy software or executables.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This is the initial step where the attacker uses Nmap to discover systems on the network.
- **Technique T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This is the step where the attacker moves tools across the network to other systems.
- **Technique T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This is the final step where the attacker deploys software or executables.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Compromise a computer using GreyEnergy mini**: This is the initial compromise.
2. **Use Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials**: This is the discovery and reconnaissance phase.
3. **Move AvosLocker and tools across the network**: This is the lateral movement phase.
4. **Deploy AvosLocker and other tools**: This is the execution phase.

### Final Answer
Based on the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, the GreyEnergy group would use T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer to move AvosLocker and tools across the network after the initial compromise and discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No

**Explanation**: The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network. PDQ Deploy is not mentioned in the related TTPs, and the sequence of TTPs suggests that the group would use T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer for this purpose. Therefore, the answer is "No" because PDQ Deploy is not part of the described sequence of TTPs.
