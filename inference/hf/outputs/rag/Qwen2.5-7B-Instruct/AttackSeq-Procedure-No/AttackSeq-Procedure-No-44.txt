Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Stealing clipboard contents
2. Capturing screenshots
3. Staging encrypted data in a temporary folder
4. Checking if the file size is 0x1000000 bytes or more
5. Dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves the attacker collecting and staging data locally before exfiltration. This aligns with the actions of stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data in a temporary folder.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves the attacker dividing data to meet size limits for exfiltration. This aligns with the action of dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Machete (the hypothetical attacker) will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. This aligns with the TTP T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, which involves dividing data to meet size limits for exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Machete will not divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. This does not align with the TTP T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, which specifically involves dividing data to meet size limits.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include collecting and staging data locally, which is consistent with T1074.001-Local Data Staging.
- The question then describes a condition where files are divided if they exceed a certain size, which is consistent with T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits.
- The related TTPs confirm that the attacker (Machete) would indeed divide files if the size exceeds 0x1000000 bytes to meet exfiltration size limits.

### Final Answer: A
