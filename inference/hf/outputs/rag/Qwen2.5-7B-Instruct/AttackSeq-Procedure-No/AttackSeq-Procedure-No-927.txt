Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Emissary Panda used the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.
2. They performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit.
3. They exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for lateral movement:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a service to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows admin shares (e.g., `\\server\c$`) to move laterally.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes:
    - Using the HyperBro backdoor for initial access.
    - Performing lateral movement using stolen credentials and EternalBlue (which is a form of exploiting remote services).
    - Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the actions described in the question did not occur, which contradicts the given sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include initial access, lateral movement, and persistence.
- The related TTPs support the use of stolen credentials and EternalBlue for lateral movement, which is consistent with the sequence described.
- The final step of exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence is also a plausible and common technique in advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Final Answer: Yes
