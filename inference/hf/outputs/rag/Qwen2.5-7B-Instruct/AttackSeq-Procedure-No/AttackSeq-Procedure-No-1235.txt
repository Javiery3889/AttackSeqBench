Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Employing crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
2. Probing potential victims' identity information using geographically distributed scan bots.
3. Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
4. Bots reporting back to a central server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which aligns with probing for identity information.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using malicious attachments in emails to gain initial access, which matches the first part of the sequence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access through spear phishing, APT28 would then use scan bots to gather more information.
  - The related TTPs support this sequence, as T1566.001 (spear phishing) is followed by T1589.001 (reconnaissance for credentials).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that APT28 would not use scan bots for probing after gaining initial access.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of APT groups, which often use various reconnaissance techniques to gather more information about the target environment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where initial access is gained through spear phishing, followed by reconnaissance to gather more information.
- The related TTPs (T1566.001 and T1589.001) support this sequence.
- APT28, known for its sophisticated and methodical approach, is likely to use a variety of techniques to gather as much information as possible after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer: Yes
