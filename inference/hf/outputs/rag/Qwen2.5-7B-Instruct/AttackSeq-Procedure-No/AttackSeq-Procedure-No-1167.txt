Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors: spear-phishing campaigns, hosting watering hole sites, and delivering initial payloads.
   - It then asks if reconnaissance was conducted by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1583.001-Domains:** This technique is related to the use of domains for hosting malicious content, which aligns with the watering hole sites mentioned in the question.
   - **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique involves searching open websites and domains to gather information about potential targets, which directly relates to the reconnaissance aspect of the question.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to visitors, which aligns with the watering hole sites mentioned.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks about reconnaissance activities, specifically searching open websites and domains to identify targets.
   - The related TTPs include T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains, which directly supports the idea of reconnaissance through searching open websites and domains.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (spear-phishing, watering hole sites, and delivering initial payloads) suggests a methodical approach to gaining access and establishing a foothold.
   - The reconnaissance step, as described in the question, is a logical precursor to executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.
   - The related TTP T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains directly supports the idea of reconnaissance through searching open websites and domains.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of actions and the support from the related TTP, it is highly plausible that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

Final Answer: A: Yes
