### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with a suspicious email containing a Word document with a macro dropper.
   - The macro dropper is designed to execute a JavaScript payload.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attacker used obfuscation techniques to hinder the analysis process only after the final JavaScript downloader dropped a file from a specified URL and executed it in the system's temporary directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):**
     - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the attacker using obfuscation to hide malicious content, which aligns with the question's focus on obfuscation.
     - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique also involves obfuscation, which is relevant to the question.
   - **Execution (Tactic):**
     - **T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves the use of JavaScript for execution, which is part of the described sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves a series of actions: a suspicious email, a macro dropper, a JavaScript payload, and finally, the execution of a file from a URL.
   - The question specifically asks about the use of obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis. The related TTPs indicate that obfuscation is a common technique used in the context of both defense evasion and execution.
   - The obfuscation techniques (T1140 and T1027) are more likely to be used earlier in the process, such as when the JavaScript payload is being delivered or when the file is being executed, rather than only after the file has been dropped and executed.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that obfuscation techniques would be used earlier in the process to hinder analysis, rather than only after the file has been dropped and executed. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
