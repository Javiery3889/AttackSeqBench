Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering user credentials through phishing domains.
2. Sending spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files.
3. Gaining a foothold into victim networks.
4. Securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending emails with links to malicious websites or files.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending emails with attachments that contain malicious content.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This TTP aligns with the second step in the sequence described in the question, where spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files are sent.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP is also relevant but not directly mentioned in the question. It involves attachments, which might be used after gaining a foothold.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The question mentions gathering user credentials through phishing domains, which is a form of initial access.
2. **Spearphishing Emails**: The next step is sending spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files. This aligns with T1566.002.
3. **Foothold**: After sending the spearphishing emails, the attackers would likely attempt to gain a foothold into the victim's network. This is a necessary step before securing persistence.
4. **Persistence**: The final step is securing alternative means of persistence on the victim's systems, which is a common tactic after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the TTPs provided. The question asks if it is likely that the attack group would send spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files to gain a foothold and then secure persistence. This sequence is consistent with the TTPs and the logical progression of an attack.

Final Answer: A
