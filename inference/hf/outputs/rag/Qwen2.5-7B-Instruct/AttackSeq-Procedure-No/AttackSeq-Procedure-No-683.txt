Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
3. Executing cryptocurrency mining scripts only after achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This technique involves using malicious images to execute code or scripts.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking compute resources to perform malicious activities, such as cryptocurrency mining.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After gaining initial access and achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images, the attackers would then execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the attackers do not execute cryptocurrency mining scripts after achieving resource hijacking, it contradicts the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves:
  1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
  2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
  3. Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.
  4. Executing cryptocurrency mining scripts.
- The related TTPs, T1204.003-Malicious Image and T1496.001-Compute Hijacking, support the sequence where malicious images are used to achieve resource hijacking, and then cryptocurrency mining scripts are executed.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
