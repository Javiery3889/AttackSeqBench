Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119). It then asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to run code on the victim's system.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using a malicious file to execute code.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique involves embedding a payload within another file to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This is relevant to the initial exploitation of the CVE-2015-5119 vulnerability.
- **Technique T1204.002-Malicious File**: This is relevant to the Flash file 'show.swf' being used as a malicious file to execute code.
- **Technique T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This is relevant to the payload being embedded in the GIF image.

Given the sequence of events:
1. Spear-phishing attack using a malicious Flash exploit.
2. Execution of the Flash file 'show.swf'.
3. Shellcode execution for Defense Evasion.
4. Installation of the payload in the GIF image.

The question asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload in the GIF image. Based on the related TTPs, the sequence of TTPs should be:
1. Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203).
2. Malicious File (T1204.002).
3. Defense Evasion (T1027.009).

The sequence described in the question aligns with the TTPs in the order of exploitation, execution of the malicious file, and then defense evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Flash file 'show.swf' is used to exploit the vulnerability (T1203).
- The Flash file then executes shellcode (T1204.002).
- The shellcode installs the payload in the GIF image (T1027.009).
- The shellcode then performs Defense Evasion (T1027.009).

The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the TTPs provided.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
