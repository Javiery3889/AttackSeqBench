Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. SkinnyBoy conducts discovery activities.
2. It extracts the volume serial number and enumerates user-specific directories and AppData folders.
3. It sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request.
4. It automates the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1082-System Information Discovery**: This is relevant to the initial discovery activities, including extracting the volume serial number and enumerating directories.
- **Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This is also relevant to the initial discovery activities, including enumerating user-specific directories and AppData folders.
- **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This is relevant to the exfiltration of the collected information via an HTTP POST request.

The question asks if it is likely to send the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request only before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding. Based on the related TTPs, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the techniques mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. SkinnyBoy conducts discovery activities (T1082 and T1083).
2. It sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request (T1041).
3. It then automates the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

Given the sequence of activities and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
