Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file.
2. Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers.
3. Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `config.json` file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery** is a technique that involves gathering information about the target's system, such as the OS version, hardware, and software configurations. This aligns with the first step of the question, where the OS version is collected from `SystemVersion.plist`.

- The question then asks if HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers is likely to occur before parsing the `config.json` file. This step is not directly related to the T1082-System Information Discovery technique, but it is a common practice in many cyber attacks to establish a secure communication channel with the C2 server before further actions.

- The final step involves parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `config.json` file. This is a data collection step that would typically follow the establishment of a secure communication channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1:** The collection of the OS version from `SystemVersion.plist` is a form of system information discovery, which is consistent with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
- **Step 2:** Establishing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers is a common practice to ensure secure data transmission and to maintain a covert channel. This step is likely to occur before further data collection and parsing.
- **Step 3:** Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `config.json` file is a data collection step that would follow the secure communication channel.

Given the sequence of actions and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is plausible that HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers would occur before parsing the `config.json` file.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
