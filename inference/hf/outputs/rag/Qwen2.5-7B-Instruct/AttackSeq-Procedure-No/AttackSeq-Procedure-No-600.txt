Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
1. They use malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.
2. They then target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning.
3. The targets are government and critical infrastructure organizations.
4. The purpose is to perform Discovery (likely to gather information about the network and systems).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify active hosts and services.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering services running on the network.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros to execute code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions the use of malicious documents with VBA macros, which aligns with the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: The question states that the group targets IP ranges for vulnerability scanning, which aligns with the T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks technique.
- **Discovery**: The question mentions the purpose of the scanning is to perform Discovery, which aligns with the T1046-Network Service Discovery technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Sednit group uses malicious documents with VBA macros to establish initial access, which is a common technique (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
2. After establishing initial access, they scan IP ranges for vulnerabilities, which is a common reconnaissance technique (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks).
3. The purpose of the scanning is to gather information about the network and systems, which is a form of Discovery (T1046-Network Service Discovery).

Given the sequence of actions and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed likely to be followed by the Sednit group.

### Final Answer: A
