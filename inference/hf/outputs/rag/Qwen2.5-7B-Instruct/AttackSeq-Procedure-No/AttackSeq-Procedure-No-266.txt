Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Establishing persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%`.
2. Setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
3. Remotely discovering systems over LAN connections.
4. Exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or registry entry to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using a non-application layer protocol for command and control, which could include custom TCP-based protocols.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After establishing persistence, the next logical step would be to discover systems over the LAN, and then exfiltrate data using a custom TCP-based protocol.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the attack did not involve remotely discovering systems over LAN connections and exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol, it would not follow the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where persistence is established, followed by remote discovery and data exfiltration.
- The related TTPs support the use of scheduled tasks for persistence and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the only option that aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
