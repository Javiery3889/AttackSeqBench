Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The malware uses `InstallUtil.exe` to evade detection by bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker.
2. The malware then creates a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that creating a scheduled task is a method used to ensure persistence.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This suggests that the malware might use scheduled tasks to escalate privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's description. After evading detection, the malware creates a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure persistence.
  - The related TTPs support this by indicating that creating a scheduled task is a method for persistence and privilege escalation.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the question's description. If the malware does not create a scheduled task, it would not ensure persistence as described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first evades detection and then ensures persistence by creating a scheduled task.
- The related TTPs confirm that creating a scheduled task is a method for both persistence and privilege escalation.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed create a scheduled task to ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: A**
