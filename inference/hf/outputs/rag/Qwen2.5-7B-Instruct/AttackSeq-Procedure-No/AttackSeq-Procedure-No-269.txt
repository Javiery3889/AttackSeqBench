Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
2. Initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
3. Data collection from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. However, it does not specify a custom TCP-based protocol.
  - **Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the custom TCP-based protocol mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the custom TCP-based protocol mentioned in the question.
  - It also fits with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, which is a common method for establishing a secure connection before using a custom protocol.
  - The data collection part of the question is consistent with typical C2 operations where the malware establishes a connection and then proceeds to gather data.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the custom TCP-based protocol and the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP as described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first establishes a connection using a custom TCP-based protocol, likely after an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, support the use of a custom TCP-based protocol for command and control.
- The data collection part of the question is consistent with typical C2 operations.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
