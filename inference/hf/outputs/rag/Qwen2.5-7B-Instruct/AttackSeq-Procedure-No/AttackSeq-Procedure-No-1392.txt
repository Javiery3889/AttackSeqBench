Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will:
1. Retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module.
2. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and host configurations.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores**: This technique involves accessing secrets stored in cloud-based secret management services, such as AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores**: This technique aligns with the first part of the question, where FIN13 retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module.
- **Technique T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique aligns with the second part of the question, where FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described in the question involves two distinct actions: retrieving secrets and gathering network/host information.
2. **Techniques Alignment**:
   - The first action (retrieving secrets) aligns with T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores.
   - The second action (gathering network/host information) aligns with T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
3. **Conclusion**: The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
