Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. Malware is used to scan for files and stage data for exfiltration.
2. Data is sent to a primary C&C server over commonly used ports.
3. There is a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration.
4. The question asks if data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration (Tactic)**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: T1008-Fallback Channels

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for data exfiltration. It does not specify the order or conditions under which data is exfiltrated.
- **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback channels for command and control communications. This suggests that if the primary C2 channel is unavailable, the attacker will use a fallback channel.

Given these TTPs, the fallback channel is designed to be used if the primary channel is unavailable. However, the question specifically asks if data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Primary C&C Server**: The malware is initially communicating with the primary C&C server over commonly used ports.
2. **Fallback C&C Server**: The fallback C&C server is embedded in the configuration but is not operational initially.
3. **Data Exfiltration**: The question does not specify that the fallback server must be operational before data is exfiltrated. The fallback server is more likely to be used if the primary server becomes unavailable, but it does not imply that data will only be sent to the primary server after the fallback server is operational.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not support the idea that data will be sent to the primary C&C server only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
