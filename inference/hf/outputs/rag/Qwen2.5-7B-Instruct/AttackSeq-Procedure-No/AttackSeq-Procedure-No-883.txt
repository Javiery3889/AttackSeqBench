Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an APT group (Naikon) to evade defenses and communicate with a C&C server. Specifically, it mentions:
1. Evading defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows.
2. Utilizing fileless loading techniques.
3. Communicating with the C&C server using HTTP and TCP protocols.
4. Using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the communication methods and evasion techniques:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control communications.
- **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using one protocol to hide or tunnel another protocol, which can be used to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

#### Answer Choice A: Yes
- **Evading Defenses**: Operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques are valid evasion tactics.
- **Communication Protocol**: The question states that the group used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
- **Backdoor Usage**: The Aria-body backdoor is used to gather information about active processes, which is a plausible action in the discovery phase.

#### Answer Choice B: No
- This choice would imply that the group did not use HTTP and TCP protocols for communication, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question clearly states that the group used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server, which is directly supported by the T1071.001-Web Protocols TTP.
- The use of the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes is a logical step in the discovery phase.
- The other TTPs (limited time windows and fileless loading) are also consistent with the described evasion tactics.

### Final Answer: Yes
