Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance and gather output files during the Discovery phase.
2. It asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the Lateral Movement phase:
- **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative authentication mechanisms, such as SAML tokens, to gain access to systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique is more aligned with traditional lateral movement methods that rely on network shares and administrative privileges.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique is more aligned with using alternative authentication mechanisms, such as SAML tokens, which are not directly related to the SMB/Windows Admin Shares technique.

Given that the question specifically asks about abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token, the most relevant TTP is **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where TG1021 is already in the Discovery phase and has gathered information.
- The Lateral Movement phase is the next step, and the question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token.
- The related TTPs indicate that using alternative authentication material (SAML tokens) is a valid technique for lateral movement.
- The question does not provide any information that would suggest the use of SMB/Windows Admin Shares for this specific scenario.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that TG1021 would indeed use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
