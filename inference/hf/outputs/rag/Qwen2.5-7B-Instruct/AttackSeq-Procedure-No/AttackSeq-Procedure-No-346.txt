Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where malware first discovers system information and process lists using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command. The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will use a SOCK5 proxy between infected hosts for its command and control operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1083)**: This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to maintain access to and control over a target system or network.
- **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves the use of a proxy to route network traffic, which can help in evading network monitoring and analysis.
- **Tactic: Discovery (T1043)**: This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to gather information about the network and systems.
- **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the methods used by attackers to gather information about running processes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The malware has already performed discovery (T1057-Process Discovery) by using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.
- The question asks about the likelihood of using a SOCK5 proxy (T1090-Proxy) for command and control operations.
- The use of a proxy (T1090-Proxy) is a common technique to maintain command and control (T1083) while evading detection and analysis.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already gathered system and process information, which is a form of discovery.
2. The next logical step in maintaining control over the infected system would be to use a proxy to route command and control traffic, which is a common evasion technique.
3. The related TTPs (T1083 for Command and Control and T1090 for Proxy) support the use of a proxy for command and control operations.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the malware is likely to use a SOCK5 proxy for its command and control operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
