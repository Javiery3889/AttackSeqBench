Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting data in SQLite databases.
2. Compressing the collected data into ZIP files.
3. Storing the compressed data in hidden folders on external storage.

The question then asks whether SunBird and Hornbill are likely to exfiltrate this data over C2 channels to their command and control servers only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which aligns with compressing the data into ZIP files.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves using C2 channels for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the data will be exfiltrated over C2 channels only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.
  - Given the related TTPs, this aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like SunBird and Hornbill, where data is often collected and stored locally before being exfiltrated over C2 channels.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the data will be exfiltrated immediately or without the need for the C2 infrastructure to store or expose the data.
  - This does not align well with the typical behavior of APTs, which often use C2 channels for both command and control and data exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are consistent with data collection and storage.
- The related TTPs indicate that C2 channels are used for exfiltration.
- The behavior described in the question (storing data locally before exfiltration) is consistent with the use of C2 channels for both command and control and data exfiltration.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data will be exfiltrated over C2 channels after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

**Final Answer: A**
