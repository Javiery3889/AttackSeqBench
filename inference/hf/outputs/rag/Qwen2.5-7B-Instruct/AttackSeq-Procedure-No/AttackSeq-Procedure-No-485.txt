Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker named FamousSparrow:
1. Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access).
2. Reading file contents.
3. Exfiltrating the data to a C&C server.
4. Collecting system information (Discovery phase).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the step of collecting system information.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing LSASS memory to extract credentials, which aligns with the step of dumping credentials.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C&C) channel, which aligns with the step of exfiltrating data to a C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after dumping credentials, FamousSparrow would read file contents, exfiltrate them, and then collect system information.
  - The sequence of actions in this choice does not align with the typical order of operations in an attack. Typically, after dumping credentials, the attacker would proceed to collect more information about the system before exfiltrating the data.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that after dumping credentials, FamousSparrow would not read file contents, exfiltrate them, and then collect system information.
  - This sequence aligns better with the typical order of operations in an attack. After dumping credentials, the attacker would likely proceed to collect more information about the system before exfiltrating the data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where FamousSparrow first dumps credentials, then reads file contents, exfiltrates the data, and finally collects system information.
- The related TTPs indicate that the typical order of operations is to first dump credentials, then collect more information about the system, and finally exfiltrate the data.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: B**
