Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
2. Using software deployment tools to move malware across the network.
3. Performing lateral movement.
4. Collecting data from network shared drives.
5. Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves moving tools laterally within a network.
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to move malware across the network.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance**: This aligns with T1083-File and Directory Discovery.
- **Using software deployment tools to move malware across the network**: This aligns with T1072-Software Deployment Tools.
- **Performing lateral movement**: This aligns with T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
- **Collecting data from network shared drives**: This is a common action in the data collection phase.
- **Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions**: This is a final action in the attack lifecycle, often part of the data exfiltration or fraud phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question includes reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data collection, which are all part of the attack lifecycle.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of software deployment tools (T1072) for moving malware and lateral tool transfer (T1570) for moving across the network.
- The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use these techniques, and based on the provided TTPs, it is highly plausible.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
