Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Leveraging an obfuscated batch script to execute `myScript.ps1` PowerShell script.
2. Establishing command and control (C2) with `njRAT` over the victim's computer.

The question asks if actions to maintain persistence are likely to be performed after these steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code. While this is relevant to the execution of `myScript.ps1`, it does not directly address the concept of maintaining persistence.
- **Execution Tactic**: This tactic involves the steps taken to run malicious code on the target system. However, it is a broad tactic and does not specifically address persistence.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Persistence**: Maintaining persistence is a critical step for an attacker to ensure they can return to the compromised system at a later time. Common methods of maintaining persistence include creating scheduled tasks, modifying system startup files, or using registry keys.
- **Given Actions**: The actions described (leveraging an obfuscated batch script and establishing C2 with `njRAT`) are steps that could be part of an initial compromise but do not inherently imply persistence.
- **Likelihood of Persistence**: After establishing initial access and C2, attackers typically seek to maintain their presence. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that actions to maintain persistence would follow.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that actions to maintain persistence are likely to be performed after the initial steps.

Final Answer: A: Yes
