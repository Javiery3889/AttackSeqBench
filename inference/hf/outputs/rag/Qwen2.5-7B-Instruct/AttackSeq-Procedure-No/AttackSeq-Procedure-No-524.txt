Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Delivery of a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
2. Use of a COM object to gather system information.
3. Execution of a PowerShell script to download a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question, as it pertains to obfuscating the malicious content to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is relevant as it involves the use of PowerShell, which is mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After initial access via a malicious document, using a COM object to gather system information is a plausible step. Then, executing a PowerShell script to download additional components is a common follow-up action.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. There is no indication in the question that the sequence of actions would be different from what is described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where initial access is achieved through a malicious document, followed by gathering system information, and then downloading additional malware components.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1059.001-PowerShell, support the use of PowerShell for downloading additional components.
- The use of a COM object to gather system information is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as it allows the attacker to understand the environment before proceeding with further actions.

### Final Answer: Yes
