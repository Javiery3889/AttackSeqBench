Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compressing and encrypting large chunks of data.
2. Staging these files for exfiltration.
3. Exfiltrating the processed files to cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
4. Collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**

This indicates that the adversary is likely to use cloud storage services for exfiltrating data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. The adversary is likely to use cloud storage services for exfiltrating the compressed and encrypted data.
  - The technique T1567.002 specifically mentions exfiltration to cloud storage, which supports this choice.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the described sequence of actions. If the adversary is not using cloud storage for exfiltration, it would be unusual to compress and encrypt data specifically for exfiltration to cloud storage.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary compresses and encrypts data, stages it for exfiltration, and then exfiltrates it to cloud storage.
- The related TTPs confirm that exfiltration to cloud storage is a common technique.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary will indeed use custom-built malware to exfiltrate the processed files to cloud storage before collecting data from an information repository.

**Final Answer: A**
