Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Establishing persistence by modifying registry keys.
2. Injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for constant execution.
3. The question asks if T9000 is likely to access the victim’s webcam and record video as part of its data collection efforts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Collection**
  - **Technique: T1125-Video Capture**: This technique involves capturing video from a webcam.
- **Tactic: Collection**
  - **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is a form of data collection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1125-Video Capture**: This technique directly relates to the question of accessing the victim’s webcam and recording video.
- **Technique T1056.001-Keylogging**: While this is also a form of data collection, it does not involve accessing the webcam.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question is specifically asking about accessing the victim’s webcam and recording video.
2. The related TTPs include T1125-Video Capture, which is directly relevant to the question.
3. T1056.001-Keylogging, while a form of data collection, does not involve the webcam.
4. Given that the question is about accessing the webcam and recording video, the most relevant TTP is T1125-Video Capture.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
