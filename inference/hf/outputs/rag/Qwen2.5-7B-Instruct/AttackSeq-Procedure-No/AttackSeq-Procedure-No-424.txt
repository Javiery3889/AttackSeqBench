Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. Initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
2. A COM object executes queries to gather system information.
3. Subsequently, payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware are downloaded.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This is the first step in the attack, which is correctly described in the question as gaining access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Technique)**: This technique is also correctly described in the question, as the malicious Word document is used to gain initial access.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is gained through a spearphishing attachment (malicious Word document), which aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
2. After gaining initial access, a COM object is used to execute queries to gather system information. This is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
3. Subsequently, payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware are downloaded. This is also a plausible step, as these are known malware families that often use such techniques to establish a foothold and exfiltrate data.

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the provided TTPs and the plausibility of the steps, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

### Final Answer: A
