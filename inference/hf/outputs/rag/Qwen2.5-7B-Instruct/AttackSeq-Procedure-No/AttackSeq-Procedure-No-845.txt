Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of malicious Microsoft Office documents and RAR archives to deliver the KerrDown malware. The sequence includes:
1. Delivery via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.
2. Execution of the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.
3. Containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the use of a malicious file to execute a payload. This aligns with the use of malicious Office documents and RAR archives to deliver the malware.
- The question asks if the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Delivery via Malicious Documents**: The question mentions the use of malicious Office documents and RAR archives, which aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique.
2. **Execution Based on System Architecture**: The question specifies that the payload is executed based on the victim's system architecture. This is a common technique to ensure the malware runs correctly on the target system.
3. **Base64 Encoding**: Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate the payload and avoid detection by antivirus software. However, the question does not explicitly mention base64 encoding as a step in the sequence.
4. **Image File Instructing to Enable Macros**: The question states that the document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. This is a common social engineering technique to trick users into enabling macros, which are often disabled by default in Office documents.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not explicitly mention the use of base64 encoding as a step in the sequence. The question focuses more on the delivery method, execution based on system architecture, and social engineering to enable macros. Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: B: No
