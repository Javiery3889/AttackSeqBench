### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119).
   - It then asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload embedded in a GIF image.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack:** This technique involves downgrading security controls to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spear-phishing email to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The spear-phishing attack and the use of a malicious Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) are part of the initial access and exploitation for client execution.
   - The question asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes. This aligns with the technique T1562.010-Downgrade Attack, which involves downgrading security controls to evade detection.
   - However, the question also mentions that the payload is embedded in a GIF image, which suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' is likely to be the initial vector for the exploit and not the final step for capturing NTLM hashes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the techniques involved, it is more plausible that the Flash file 'show.swf' would be used to exploit the vulnerability and gain initial access, rather than directly capturing NTLM hashes.
   - The technique of downgrading NTLM to capture hashes is more likely to occur after the initial access and during the execution phase, but not necessarily as part of the Flash exploit itself.

**Final Answer: B: No**
