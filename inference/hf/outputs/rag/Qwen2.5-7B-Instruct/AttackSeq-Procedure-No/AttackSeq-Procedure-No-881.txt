Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the Aria-body backdoor engages in Collection activities (creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection), it is likely to gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase only afterward.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system itself, such as system details, hostname, and public IP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1082-System Information Discovery** directly aligns with the question's requirement to gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP.
- The question specifies that these activities are part of the Discovery phase, which is consistent with the TTPs provided.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Collection Phase**: The Aria-body backdoor is described as engaging in Collection activities, which include creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection.
2. **Transition to Discovery**: After these Collection activities, the question asks if the backdoor is likely to gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase.
3. **Relevance of TTPs**: The related TTPs (T1082-System Information Discovery) directly address the gathering of system information, which aligns with the question's requirement.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the Collection phase, the Aria-body backdoor would indeed gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
