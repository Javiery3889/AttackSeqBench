### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where SBDH malware uses HTTP and SMTP protocols for network communication with its C&C server.
   - It then asks whether the malware will employ powerful filters to specify and collect targeted data based on file extension, creation date, and file size.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for command and control (C&C) communications.
   - **T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using email protocols for C&C communications.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C&C) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is specifically about the Command and Control tactic, and the related TTPs are all related to C&C communications.
   - The question does not explicitly mention data exfiltration, but it does mention the use of powerful filters to collect targeted data.
   - The related TTPs do not directly address the filtering of data based on file extension, creation date, and file size. However, the context of C&C communications and the use of powerful filters to specify and collect targeted data is plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to assume that after establishing C&C communications, the malware might employ powerful filters to specify and collect targeted data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware will indeed employ such filters.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
