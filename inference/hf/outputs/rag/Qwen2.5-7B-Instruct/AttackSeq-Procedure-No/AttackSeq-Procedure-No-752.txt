Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
2. Collecting the MAC address of the infected host.
3. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control communication.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the internet connection status of the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique is relevant to the collection of network information, which could include the MAC address.
- **Technique T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique is relevant to the communication with control servers, which aligns with the HTTP POST requests mentioned in the question.
- **Technique T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique is more focused on determining the internet connection status, which is less directly related to collecting the MAC address.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect the MAC address as part of its discovery activities. The related TTPs suggest that the implant is involved in network configuration discovery, which is a plausible reason for collecting the MAC address.
- The communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests is also a relevant TTP, indicating that the implant is capable of such actions after collecting the necessary information.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant would indeed collect the MAC address as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
