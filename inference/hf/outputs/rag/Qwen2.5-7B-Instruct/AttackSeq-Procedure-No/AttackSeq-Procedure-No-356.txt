Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Scanning the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
2. Identifying potential expansion points.
3. Gathering unsecured credentials for Azure AD services.
4. Using hacktools to move laterally within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying network services and their associated ports, which aligns with the initial scanning for open ports 8080, 5900, and 40.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows administrative shares to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the final step of moving laterally.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally, which could be part of the final step.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial network scanning and identifying potential expansion points, the attacker would gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services and then use hacktools to move laterally.
  - The related TTPs support the idea of network service discovery (T1046) and lateral movement (T1021.002 and T1570), which are consistent with the described sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attacker would not gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services or use hacktools to move laterally.
  - This does not align with the described sequence, as it skips the critical steps of credential gathering and lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial scanning for open ports (8080, 5900, and 40) is a form of network service discovery (T1046).
- The identification of potential expansion points is part of the discovery phase.
- Gathering unsecured credentials for Azure AD services is a critical step in compromising the network, which is a common tactic in many cyber attacks.
- Using hacktools to move laterally within the network is a standard technique for expanding the attacker's foothold.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
