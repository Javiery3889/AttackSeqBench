Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
2. Malicious Implants: Use of BlackEnergy 3.
3. Payload Execution: Execution of payloads through employee-enabled macro execution.
4. Question: Is it likely that Ruby scripts will be used to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution?

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This technique involves gathering information about user activity, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code, which is often used in macro-enabled documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Ruby scripts are likely to be used for payload execution.
  - However, the related TTPs specifically mention the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in the context of payload execution. There is no direct mention of Ruby scripts in the provided TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Ruby scripts are unlikely to be used for payload execution.
  - Given the specific mention of VBA in the related TTPs, this choice aligns more closely with the provided context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of activities that includes reconnaissance and the use of BlackEnergy 3, which is known to use VBA for payload execution.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of VBA for execution, which is consistent with the attack sequence described.
- There is no mention of Ruby scripts in the provided TTPs, making it less likely that Ruby scripts would be used for payload execution in this context.

### Final Answer: B
