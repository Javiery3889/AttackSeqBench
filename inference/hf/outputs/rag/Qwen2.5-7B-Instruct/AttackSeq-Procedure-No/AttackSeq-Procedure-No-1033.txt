Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Custom malware is used to exfiltrate files to Dropbox.
2. cURL for Windows is used to upload the exfiltrated files.
3. The attackers are asked if they are likely to compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase only afterward.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the Collection phase:
- **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique involves using a utility to archive data.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves using a custom method to archive data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique aligns with using a standard utility like WinRAR to compress data.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique aligns with using a custom method, which could be a custom script or tool, but not necessarily WinRAR.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about compressing proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase.
- T1560.001-Archive via Utility directly aligns with using a utility like WinRAR for archiving data.
- T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method does not specify a particular utility and could be used for any custom method, which might not necessarily be WinRAR.

Given the specific mention of WinRAR in the question and the alignment of T1560.001 with using a utility, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers are likely to use WinRAR for compression in the Collection phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
