Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT-TOCS uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control operations. It then asks whether it is likely to exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to access other systems or resources.
- **Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools or data laterally within the network.
- **Tactic: Execution** - This tactic involves the process of running code or commands on a system.
- **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This technique involves using PowerShell for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is used to execute PowerShell scripts, which is mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic Lateral Movement and Technique T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: These are directly related to moving laterally within the network and transferring tools or data, which aligns with the question's query about network projection.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Action**: APT-TOCS uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts. This is a clear indication of the use of T1059.001-PowerShell.
2. **Lateral Movement**: After downloading the scripts, the next logical step would be to use these scripts for command and control operations, which often involves moving laterally within the network to access other systems.
3. **Network Projection**: The term "network projection" suggests the ability to move from one system to another within the internal network, which is a key aspect of lateral movement.

Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that APT-TOCS would exhibit lateral movement after downloading the encrypted data scripts.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
