Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.
2. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
3. Scanning for deleted files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves monitoring network traffic.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which can include processes and memory utilization.
- **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and gathering information about running processes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This is the first action mentioned in the question.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This aligns with the second action of gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
- **T1057-Process Discovery**: This aligns with the second action as well, but it is more specific to processes.

The third action of scanning for deleted files is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question is asking if Regin is likely to perform these actions during the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Network Sniffing (T1040)**: This is a common initial step in reconnaissance.
2. **System Information Discovery (T1082)**: This includes gathering information on processes and memory utilization, which is a logical next step after sniffing network traffic.
3. **Process Discovery (T1057)**: This is a subset of T1082 and is also a relevant technique.

Scanning for deleted files (T1027) is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and is not a typical part of the initial discovery phase.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1040 (Network Sniffing)
- T1082 (System Information Discovery)
- T1057 (Process Discovery)

### Final Answer: A: Yes
