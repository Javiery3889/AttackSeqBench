Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
     - Deployment of Hermes ransomware.
     - Encryption of files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.
     - Leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they established command and control (C&C) communication by utilizing backdoor malware to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique is directly related to the ransomware's function of encrypting files and leaving ransom notes, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography for C&C communication, which is different from the asymmetric RSA encryption used by the ransomware. However, it is still relevant to the C&C aspect of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about the establishment of C&C communication using backdoor malware.
   - The related TTPs do not directly mention backdoor malware or the specific technique of T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography for C&C communication.
   - The question is more focused on the C&C aspect, which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking about a specific sequence of actions (C&C communication using backdoor malware) that is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
   - The TTPs provided are more focused on the encryption aspect (T1486) and symmetric cryptography for C&C (T1573.001), but do not explicitly mention backdoor malware or the exact sequence of actions described in the question.
   - Given the lack of direct support from the provided TTPs for the specific sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the sequence is not likely to be established as described.

**Final Answer: B: No**
