Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. POWERSHOWER sends system information to the C2 server.
2. It then enters a communications loop with the C2 server.
3. Finally, it collects system information on the infected machine.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves sending data from the target system to a C2 server. This aligns with the first part of the sequence where POWERSHOWER sends system information to the C2 server.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system. This aligns with the final part of the sequence where POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after sending system information to the C2 server, POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server and then collect system information on the infected machine.
  - The sequence described in the question aligns with the techniques provided in the related TTPs. POWERSHOWER first exfiltrates (sends) system information to the C2 server, then enters a communications loop (which could involve further data exfiltration or command and control), and finally collects system information on the infected machine.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that POWERSHOWER will not enter a communications loop with the C2 server after sending system information and will directly collect system information on the infected machine.
  - This does not align with the sequence described in the question, as it skips the communications loop phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves POWERSHOWER sending system information to the C2 server, then entering a communications loop, and finally collecting system information on the infected machine.
- The related TTPs support this sequence, with T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel for the initial data exfiltration and T1082-System Information Discovery for the final information collection.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes the communications loop phase.

**Final Answer: A**
