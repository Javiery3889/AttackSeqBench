Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file.
   - The question then asks if Sidewinder (a hypothetical APT group) is likely to employ DLL sideloading to execute Srvstr.exe for defense evasion.
   - After that, it mentions the HTA file checking for antivirus software using WMI and communicating with the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an exploit (CVE-2017-11882) is used to download an HTA file. This aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - The question then asks if Sidewinder is likely to use DLL sideloading (T1574.002) to execute Srvstr.exe. This is a plausible step in the sequence, as DLL sideloading can be used for defense evasion.
   - The HTA file then checks for antivirus software using WMI and communicates with the C2 server, which are additional steps that can be part of the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, the sequence described in the question is plausible. Sidewinder is likely to use DLL sideloading for defense evasion before executing Srvstr.exe.
   - Therefore, the answer is: "Final Answer: A: Yes"
