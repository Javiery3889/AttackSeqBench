Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of a password dumper (run.exe) to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS.
2. The question asks if APT28 is likely to enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups during the Discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the permissions associated with Windows groups.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the LSASS process to extract credentials from memory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique is directly related to the deployment of the password dumper (run.exe) to access credentials from LSASS.
- **Technique T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**: This technique is related to the Discovery phase and involves gathering information about permissions associated with Windows groups.

Given that APT28 is known for its sophisticated and methodical approach to cyber attacks, it is highly likely that after gaining access to credentials (through T1003.001-LSASS Memory), APT28 would proceed to gather additional information about the environment, including the permissions associated with Windows groups (through T1069-Permission Groups Discovery).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Action**: APT28 deploys a password dumper (run.exe) to access credentials from LSASS, which is a common technique for Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory).
2. **Subsequent Action**: After gaining access to credentials, APT28 would likely want to understand the environment better, including the permissions associated with Windows groups, to identify potential targets or privileges (T1069-Permission Groups Discovery).

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 would indeed enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
