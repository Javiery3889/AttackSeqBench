### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Gamaredon, a known threat actor. The sequence starts with using backdoors to list interesting files, such as Office documents, and then asks if they are likely to automatically upload these documents to a C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's mention of scanning removable drives.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which aligns with the question's mention of scanning network shares.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the initial step of listing interesting files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after listing interesting files, Gamaredon would automatically upload these files to a C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.
     - Given the related TTPs, this sequence makes sense. Gamaredon would likely upload the harvested documents to a C&C server to maintain communication and control over the stolen data. After this, they would proceed to scan all drives for additional sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon would not automatically upload the harvested documents to a C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.
     - This sequence does not align as well with the typical behavior of threat actors like Gamaredon. It would be more efficient and strategic to upload the initial set of documents to the C&C server before further scanning for additional sensitive data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
