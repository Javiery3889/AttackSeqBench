Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Evading defenses by launching malicious payloads via legitimate signed applications.
2. Using PKPLUG to achieve persistence.
3. Employing DLL side-loading.
4. Delivering payloads through spear-phishing emails.
5. Exploiting vulnerable Microsoft Office applications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Persistence
- Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate if the sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.

- **Evading Defenses**: This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, but it is not directly related to the TTPs provided.
- **Persistence**: This is a tactic that PKPLUG is known to use, and DLL side-loading is a technique for achieving persistence.
- **DLL Side-Loading**: This is explicitly mentioned as a related TTP.
- **Spear-Phishing Emails**: This is a delivery method, but it is not directly related to the TTPs provided.
- **Exploiting Vulnerable Microsoft Office Applications**: This is a method of delivery, but it is not directly related to the TTPs provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if PKPLUG is likely to achieve persistence by employing DLL side-loading only after using spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads through exploiting vulnerable Microsoft Office applications.
- The related TTPs specifically mention DLL side-loading as a technique for persistence.
- The question does not mention any specific use of spear-phishing emails or exploiting vulnerable Microsoft Office applications in the context of the TTPs provided.
- The sequence described in the question does not align with the provided TTPs, as the TTPs only mention DLL side-loading for persistence and do not include the other steps mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer: B: No
