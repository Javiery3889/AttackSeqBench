### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN4 uses a proxy server during the command and control phase instead of relying on Tor for anonymous communication after stealing credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of proxy servers to route traffic through an intermediary, which can help in maintaining anonymity and evading detection.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This is a more advanced form of proxying where traffic is routed through multiple proxy servers, further enhancing anonymity.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves the use of symmetric encryption to secure communications, but it does not directly relate to the use of proxy servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the use of proxy servers as described in T1090 and T1090.003. These techniques are specifically about using proxy servers to route traffic, which can be a plausible method for maintaining anonymity during the command and control phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that FIN4 does not use proxy servers, which contradicts the information provided in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that FIN4 does use proxy servers during the command and control phase. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
