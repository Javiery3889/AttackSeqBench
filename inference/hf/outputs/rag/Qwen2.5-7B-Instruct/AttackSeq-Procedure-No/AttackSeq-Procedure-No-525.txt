Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions. It then asks if it is likely that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant will download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the use of PowerShell command line scripts.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating information, which aligns with the scenario of downloading encoded blobs and decoding them.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant will download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
  - Given the related TTPs, this aligns well with the techniques of using PowerShell (T1059.001) and defense evasion through deobfuscation (T1140).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not use encoded blobs or PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of PowerShell and defense evasion techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario involving file collection and defense evasion.
- The related TTPs mention the use of PowerShell for execution and the use of deobfuscation for defense evasion.
- Answer Choice A aligns with these related TTPs, as it suggests the use of encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell scripts for defense evasion.
- Answer Choice B does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of PowerShell and defense evasion techniques.

### Final Answer: A
