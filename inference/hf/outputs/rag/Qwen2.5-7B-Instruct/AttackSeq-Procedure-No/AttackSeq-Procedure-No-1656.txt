Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email.
2. The email contained a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
3. The VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file.
4. The .doc file led to the execution of the malware.

The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs for persistence.
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using malicious files to execute code.
- **T1053.003-Cron**: Repeated for emphasis, indicating the importance of this technique.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will use the cron utility for persistence.
  - The related TTPs mention T1053.003-Cron, which aligns with this choice.
  - Cron jobs are a common method for persistence, especially in Unix-like systems, which is consistent with the use of a Geocities website (a web hosting service that often targets users with less technical knowledge).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use the cron utility for persistence.
  - The related TTPs do not provide any information that directly contradicts the use of cron jobs, but they do emphasize the use of cron jobs for persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware is likely to be executed through a .doc file, which is a common method for delivering malware to users.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of cron jobs (T1053.003) for persistence, which is a plausible method for the malware to ensure it remains active on the system.
- The use of cron jobs is a well-known technique for persistence, especially in environments where PowerShell might be less likely to be used or detected.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
