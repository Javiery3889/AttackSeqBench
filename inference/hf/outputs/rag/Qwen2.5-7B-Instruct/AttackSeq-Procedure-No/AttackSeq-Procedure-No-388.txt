### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malicious code is executed using the AtomBombing technique.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon rather than the executable's icon assigned by the operating system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting:** This technique involves misleading security mechanisms to avoid detection.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising the true nature of malicious activity to avoid detection.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using the resource fork of a file to store additional data, which can be used to hide or manipulate file attributes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking** is directly related to the question as it involves using the resource fork of a file to store additional data, which can be used to manipulate file attributes.
   - The question specifically mentions presenting a macOS JPEG or text file icon rather than the executable's icon. This aligns with the concept of using the resource fork to store additional data that can be used to change the file's icon.
   - **T1036-Masquerading** is also relevant as it involves disguising the true nature of malicious activity, which can include changing file icons to avoid detection.
   - **T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting** is more about misleading security mechanisms, which is not directly related to changing file icons.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using the resource fork to change the file icon, which aligns with the concept of masquerading.
   - Therefore, it is likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon rather than the executable's icon.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
