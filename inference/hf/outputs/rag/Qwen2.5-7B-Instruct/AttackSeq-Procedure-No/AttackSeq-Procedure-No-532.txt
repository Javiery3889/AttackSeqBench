Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts.
2. Downloading additional malware.
3. The Dropping Elephant backdoor is then expected to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the question's mention of stealing cookies from Google Chrome and Safari.
- **T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This technique specifically targets stealing web session cookies, which are also related to stealing browser credentials.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Evading Defenses**: The initial actions (decoding blobs into PowerShell scripts) are a common method to evade detection.
2. **Downloading Additional Malware**: This is a typical step in a multi-stage attack.
3. **Stealing Browser Cookies**: The Dropping Elephant backdoor is known to target browser cookies, which are crucial for maintaining user sessions and accessing saved credentials.

Given the related TTPs, both techniques (T1555.003 and T1539) are relevant to stealing browser credentials. However, T1539 specifically targets web session cookies, which are a subset of browser credentials.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the Dropping Elephant backdoor is most likely to steal web session cookies, which are a type of browser cookie. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
