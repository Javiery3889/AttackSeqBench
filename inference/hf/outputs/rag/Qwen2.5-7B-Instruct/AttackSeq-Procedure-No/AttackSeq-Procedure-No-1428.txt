Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the spyware first extracts Chrome passwords by querying SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** - This is relevant to the initial action of extracting Chrome passwords.
   - **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers** - This is a specific technique under Credential Access, confirming the method used to extract Chrome passwords.
   - **Tactic: Collection** - This is relevant to the subsequent actions of collecting data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images.
   - **Technique: T1119-Automated Collection** - This technique is specifically about automated data collection, which aligns with the question's description of automatic collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about a sequence of actions after the initial credential access.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the spyware is capable of performing automated data collection (T1119) as part of the Collection tactic.
   - The question mentions that the spyware will "automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images," which aligns with the T1119 technique.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial action of extracting Chrome passwords (T1555.003) is confirmed by the related TTPs.
   - The spyware is described as performing additional actions (USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images) which are part of the Collection tactic.
   - The T1119 technique specifically mentions automated collection, which supports the idea of the spyware automatically collecting data from various sources.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
