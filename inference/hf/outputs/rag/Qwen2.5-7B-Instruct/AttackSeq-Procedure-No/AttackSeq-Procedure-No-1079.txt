Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document.
2. Execution of these scripts through macro-triggered events.
3. Employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.
4. Using decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the use of PowerShell scripts.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection, which aligns with the obfuscation of the backdoor payload.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the use of decoded scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial access and execution of encoded PowerShell scripts, the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence.
  - This sequence aligns with the techniques of T1059.001 (PowerShell execution), T1027.010 (Command Obfuscation), and T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the campaign will not use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence after the initial access and execution of encoded PowerShell scripts.
  - This does not align with the techniques of T1059.001, T1027.010, and T1140, as it skips the step of deobfuscating the scripts to drop the persistence component.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves a series of TTPs that are well-aligned with the related TTPs.
- The use of encoded PowerShell scripts for initial access and macro-triggered execution is a common technique.
- The subsequent use of obfuscation (T1027.010) and then deobfuscation (T1140) to drop persistence components (like invoker.ps1) is a plausible and common sequence in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.
- Answer Choice A aligns with this sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
