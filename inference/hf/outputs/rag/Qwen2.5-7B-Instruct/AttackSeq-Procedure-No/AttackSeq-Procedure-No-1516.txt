Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A backdoor is installed.
2. Data is exfiltrated over a C&C channel using encrypted communication.
3. The question asks if it is likely that CaddyWiper will be deployed to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the destruction of data, which aligns with the exfiltration and potential destruction of data.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files, which could be part of the wiping process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the data exfiltration, the attackers will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.
  - CaddyWiper is known for its capability to wipe files and partitions, which aligns with the technique T1070.004-File Deletion.
  - The tactic of Impact (T1485-Data Destruction) also supports the idea of destroying data, which could include wiping files and partitions.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers will not deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.
  - There is no direct evidence from the related TTPs that contradicts the deployment of CaddyWiper, but the question does not provide a clear reason why CaddyWiper would not be used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is exfiltrated and then potentially wiped.
- CaddyWiper is a known tool for wiping files and partitions, which aligns with the techniques and tactics provided.
- The related TTPs support the idea of data destruction and file deletion, which are consistent with the use of CaddyWiper.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that CaddyWiper is likely to be deployed to wipe files and partitions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
