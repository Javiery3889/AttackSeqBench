Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.
2. After performing routines on the iOS device, the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 operations.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not part of the C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after performing routines on the iOS device, the app will send the gathered information via HTTP. This aligns with the TTP T1048.003, which involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not part of the C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the app will not send the gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. This would imply that the data is exfiltrated using a different method, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that the app uses FTP for C2 operations, which is a web protocol. However, the question also asks if the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.
- The related TTP T1048.003 specifically mentions exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols, which could include HTTP.
- The question does not provide any information that would contradict the use of HTTP for exfiltration after the routines are performed.

### Final Answer: Yes

Final Answer: A
