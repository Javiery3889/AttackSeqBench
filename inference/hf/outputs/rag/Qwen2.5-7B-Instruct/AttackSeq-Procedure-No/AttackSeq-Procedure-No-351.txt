Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
2. Dropping an embedded downloader file.
3. Establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
4. Executing on the victim's machine.
5. Downloading the full RAT component from a specific IP and port.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. However, the question specifies a custom TCP protocol, which is not a web protocol.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the client machine. This aligns with the initial access and dropping of the downloader file.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control. The question specifies port 10001, which is non-standard.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The custom TCP protocol (non-standard port) is consistent with T1571-Non-Standard Port.
  - The execution of the malware and downloading of the full RAT component also align with the techniques provided.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. The use of a custom TCP protocol (non-standard port) is not consistent with T1071.001-Web Protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access through weaponized RTF documents and the dropping of the downloader file align with T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
- Establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol aligns with T1571-Non-Standard Port.
- Executing on the victim's machine and downloading the full RAT component are consistent with the described sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
