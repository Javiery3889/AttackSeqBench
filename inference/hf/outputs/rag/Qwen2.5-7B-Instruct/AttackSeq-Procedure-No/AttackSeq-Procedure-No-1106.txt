### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files while skipping certain file types in the discovery phase.
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to stage data on compromised hosts prior to exfiltration, rather than using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves the attacker staging data on the compromised host before exfiltration.
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves the attacker staging data on a remote server or another host before exfiltration.
   - **T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves the attacker using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions that CosmicDuke is searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types. This suggests a focus on local data collection and manipulation.
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to stage data on compromised hosts prior to exfiltration. This aligns with the TTPs T1074.001 and T1074.002, which involve local and remote data staging, respectively.
   - The question also mentions that CosmicDuke is not using a clipboard stealer (T1115), which suggests that the data collection is not focused on clipboard data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that CosmicDuke would stage data on compromised hosts prior to exfiltration, rather than using a clipboard stealer.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
