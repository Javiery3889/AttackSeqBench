Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether threat actors will attempt to bypass detection mechanisms to impair defenses only after they have escalated privileges to gain administrative control over the target network. This implies a sequence of actions where threat actors first gain access (possibly through valid credentials) and then escalate privileges, followed by an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to escalate privileges, which is a common method for gaining administrative control.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to escalate privileges, which is also a common method for gaining administrative control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after acquiring valid credentials and escalating privileges, threat actors will then attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.
  - Given the related TTPs, it is logical that after gaining administrative control, threat actors would want to avoid detection. Techniques like T1078.002 and T1078 involve gaining administrative access, which is a prerequisite for the next step of bypassing detection mechanisms.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that threat actors will not attempt to bypass detection mechanisms after gaining administrative control.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of threat actors, who often seek to maintain stealth and avoid detection once they have gained a foothold in the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where threat actors first gain access (through valid credentials) and then escalate privileges to gain administrative control.
- The related TTPs (T1078.002 and T1078) are directly related to gaining administrative control.
- After gaining administrative control, the next logical step for threat actors is to attempt to bypass detection mechanisms to avoid being discovered and removed from the network.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
