Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where SLUB malware exfiltrates system information and screenshots via a Mattermost server during the Exfiltration phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware will subsequently collect system information and capture screenshots during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This TTP is relevant to the exfiltration phase, indicating that the malware uses a C2 channel (like the Mattermost server) to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This TTP is relevant to the collection phase, specifically mentioning screen capture as a technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about a transition from the Exfiltration phase to the Discovery phase.
   - The related TTPs confirm that the malware is capable of both exfiltrating data and collecting information (including screen captures) via the same C2 channel.
   - However, the question is specifically asking if the malware will "subsequently" collect system information and capture screenshots during the Discovery phase after exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already exfiltrated data and captured screenshots during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The Discovery phase typically involves the attacker learning more about the target environment, which often includes collecting additional information.
   - Given that the malware is capable of both exfiltration and collection, it is plausible that the malware would continue to collect system information and capture screenshots during the Discovery phase.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the malware will indeed collect system information and capture screenshots during the Discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the answer is: "Final Answer: A: Yes"
