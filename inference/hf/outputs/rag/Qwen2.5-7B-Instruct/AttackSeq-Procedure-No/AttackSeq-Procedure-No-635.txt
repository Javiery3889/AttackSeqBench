Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malicious JavaScript code is inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page. This exploit page then uses CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute an embedded shellcode payload. The question asks if it is likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques to achieve this.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by download, which aligns with the scenario of inserting malicious JavaScript into a news portal.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves the use of JavaScript for execution, which is consistent with the scenario of using malicious JavaScript to redirect victims.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Heap Spraying**: Heap spraying is a technique used to increase the likelihood of a successful buffer overflow attack by filling the heap with a specific pattern. This technique is more commonly associated with buffer overflow exploits rather than the specific scenario described in the question.
- **CVE-2019-13720**: This vulnerability is related to the use of JavaScript to exploit a specific flaw in Google Chrome. The question does not mention any heap spraying or buffer overflow, but rather a direct exploitation of the vulnerability to gain arbitrary read/write capabilities and execute shellcode.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario described involves a drive-by download (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and the use of JavaScript (T1059.007-JavaScript) to exploit a specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome.
- Heap spraying is not a typical technique used in this type of exploit, as the exploit is leveraging a specific vulnerability rather than a buffer overflow.
- The question does not provide any indication that heap spraying was used in this scenario.

### Final Answer: B: No
