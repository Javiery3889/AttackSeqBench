Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where persistence has been established within a target network. It then asks whether tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using spearphishing to move laterally within a network. Spearphishing typically involves sending malicious emails or messages to trick users into performing actions that compromise the network.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems within the network to maintain or expand access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after persistence is established, tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing techniques.
  - Given the related TTPs, internal spearphishing (T1534) can indeed involve transferring files to a network share to deploy tools or malware. This aligns with the idea of lateral movement and persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that tools will not be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing techniques.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as internal spearphishing can involve transferring files to deploy tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where persistence is established, and the next step is to move tools laterally.
- The related TTPs indicate that internal spearphishing (T1534) can involve transferring files to a network share to deploy tools.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
