Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) to load a malicious DLL during the Defense Evasion phase.
   - The question then asks if TClient is likely to use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL through a benign file, which is consistent with the question.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` utility to execute code from a DLL, which is also related to the DLL hijacking technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is specifically asking about the use of SSL to connect to the C&C server before the Defense Evasion phase.
   - The related TTPs do not directly mention SSL or the C&C server connection. They are more focused on the techniques used to evade detection and load malicious code.
   - The question implies a sequence of actions where the use of SSL for C&C communication is a step that occurs before the Defense Evasion phase, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The related TTPs do not provide information about the use of SSL for C&C communication.
   - The question asks if it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase. Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support this claim.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is unlikely that TClient will use SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
