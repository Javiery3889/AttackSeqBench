Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Darkhotel APT:
1. Deployment of malware components (downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers).
2. Targeting chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access.
3. Using sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates.
4. Encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves targeting chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves using keyloggers to capture credentials.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This directly aligns with the question's mention of targeting chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access.
- **Technique T1056.001-Keylogging**: While keylogging is mentioned, the question specifically asks about targeting chat messages, which is more aligned with T1552.008.
- **Technique T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This is also related to messaging applications but is more general and not as specific as T1552.008.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will target chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access.
- The related TTPs provide specific techniques that align with this action.
- The most relevant TTP is T1552.008-Chat Messages, which directly matches the question's description.

Given the alignment of the question with the specific TTP and the related context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs supports the likelihood of the described actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
