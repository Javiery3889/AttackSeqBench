Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT15 has already obtained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and stolen a VPN certificate. The question then asks whether APT15 is likely to use these valid account credentials (VPN credentials) to remotely access the victim networks instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1078-Valid Accounts** is a technique that involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. This aligns with the scenario where APT15 has obtained valid credentials (domain administrator and VPN credentials).
- The question specifically mentions the use of valid account information for remote access, which is directly related to the T1078-Valid Accounts technique.
- The question also mentions the use of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS), which are typically used for maintaining persistence and remote access. However, the question asks whether APT15 is likely to use valid account information instead of deploying these backdoors.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: APT15 has already gained initial access to the network using Mimikatz and stolen a VPN certificate.
2. **Defense Evasion and Persistence**: The use of valid account information (T1078-Valid Accounts) is a common method for maintaining persistence and evading detection.
3. **Remote Access**: Using valid account information (VPN credentials) for remote access is a straightforward and effective method that does not require deploying additional backdoors.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT15 is likely to use valid account information (VPN credentials) for remote access instead of deploying additional backdoors. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
