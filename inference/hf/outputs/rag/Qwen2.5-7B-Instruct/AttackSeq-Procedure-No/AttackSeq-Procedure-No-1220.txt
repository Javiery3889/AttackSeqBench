Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. T9000 achieves persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into explorer.exe.
2. The malware then uses the BITS protocol to exfiltrate stolen data.
3. Finally, the malware creates mutexes and named events to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) protocol to transfer data in the background, which can be used for exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into the AppInit DLL search order to achieve persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique is directly related to using the BITS protocol for data exfiltration. It fits well with the second step in the sequence described in the question.
- **Technique T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique is related to persistence but does not directly address the exfiltration of data using the BITS protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The malware achieves persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into explorer.exe. This is a valid persistence technique.
2. **Exfiltration**: The question asks if the malware is likely to use the BITS protocol to exfiltrate stolen data. The related TTP T1197-BITS Jobs directly supports this step.
3. **Avoiding Detection**: After exfiltration, the malware creates mutexes and named events to avoid detection. This is a common technique to evade detection.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as follows:
- Persistence (T1546.010-AppInit DLLs)
- Exfiltration using BITS (T1197-BITS Jobs)
- Avoiding Detection (creating mutexes and named events)

### Final Answer: A: Yes
