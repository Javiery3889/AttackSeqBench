Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives.
2. This occurs during the Collection phase.
3. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the exfiltration phase:
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated data exfiltration, which could align with the "every 10 minutes" frequency mentioned in the question.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration, which is consistent with the question's mention of exfiltrating data to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the automated exfiltration technique (T1020) and the use of a C2 channel (T1041) for exfiltration.
  - The frequency of every 10 minutes is a plausible interval for automated exfiltration, as it suggests a regular and consistent data exfiltration pattern.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware does not exfiltrate data every 10 minutes, which contradicts the specific frequency mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where PROMETHIUM compresses files and then exfiltrates data to a C2 server.
- The related TTPs (T1020 and T1041) support the idea of automated and C2-based exfiltration.
- The frequency of every 10 minutes is a reasonable interval for automated exfiltration, as it indicates a regular and consistent data exfiltration pattern.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs supports the exfiltration occurring every 10 minutes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
