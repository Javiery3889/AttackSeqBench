Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers use images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers will gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin instead of verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means, which aligns with the question's context of phishing and credential access.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves using a keylogger to capture keystrokes, which is a method to gather credentials.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link in a phishing email, which is consistent with the scenario described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers will use a keylogger plugin to gather credentials.
  - Keylogging is a common technique used in credential access (T1056.001) and can be used to capture credentials without needing real-time interaction or prompting for 2-step verification codes.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers will not use a keylogger plugin and will instead verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for 2-step verification codes.
  - While this is a possible approach, it is less likely because keylogging is a more direct and stealthy method of credential gathering.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already used images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, indicating a sophisticated approach.
- Keylogging (T1056.001) is a well-known and effective method for gathering credentials without needing real-time interaction or prompting for 2-step verification codes.
- The use of a keylogger aligns with the tactic of credential access and the technique of T1056.001, which is a common and effective method in the context of phishing attacks.

### Final Answer: Yes
