Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.
2. The Naikon APT group is likely to execute additional commands received from the server.
3. The group uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control.
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system to understand its configuration and capabilities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after collecting information, the APT group will execute additional commands and use web protocols for C&C communication.
  - This aligns with the TTPs provided:
    - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: The backdoor collects detailed information.
    - **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: The group uses HTTP and TCP for C&C communication.
  - The sequence of actions described in the question fits well with these TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the APT group will not execute additional commands or use web protocols for C&C communication after collecting information.
  - This does not align with the TTPs provided, as it contradicts the use of web protocols for C&C communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information (T1082-System Information Discovery).
- The Naikon APT group is likely to execute additional commands (implied by the question's phrasing).
- The group uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

Given the alignment of the question's sequence with the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
