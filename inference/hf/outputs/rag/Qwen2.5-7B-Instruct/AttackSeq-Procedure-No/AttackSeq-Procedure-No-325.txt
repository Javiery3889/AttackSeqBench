Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the XAgent app:
1. Collects a list of processes for discovery.
2. Hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7 devices.
3. Sends the gathered information (including the processes data) via HTTP to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network or system. It aligns with the third step of the sequence, where the app sends the gathered information to the C2 server.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the discovery of processes running on a system. It aligns with the first step of the sequence, where the app collects a list of processes for discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the app will perform all the described actions in the sequence.
  - The app first discovers processes (T1057-Process Discovery).
  - Then, it hides its icon and runs in the background (implied by the question but not explicitly listed as a TTP).
  - Finally, it sends the gathered information to the C2 server (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the app will not perform the described actions in the sequence.
  - Given the related TTPs, this is less likely because the sequence described in the question aligns with the techniques and tactics mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.
- The app first discovers processes (T1057-Process Discovery).
- Then, it hides its icon and runs in the background (implied by the question but not explicitly listed as a TTP).
- Finally, it sends the gathered information to the C2 server (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
