Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 (a known APT group) will:
1. Dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
2. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process to extract credentials. This aligns with the first part of the question, where FIN13 is likely to dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
- The second part of the question mentions gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance. While this is a valid technique for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Credential Access Tactic**: This tactic is directly supported by the T1003.001-LSASS Memory technique, which is explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
2. **Gathering Information**: While gathering information on network and host configurations is a common practice, it is not directly supported by the provided TTPs. The related TTPs do not mention any techniques for gathering network and host information.

### Final Answer
Based on the provided TTPs and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that aligns with the Credential Access tactic and the LSASS Memory technique.

Final Answer: A
