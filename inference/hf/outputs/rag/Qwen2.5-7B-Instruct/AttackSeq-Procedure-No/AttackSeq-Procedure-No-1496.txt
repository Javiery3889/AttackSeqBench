Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Charming Kitten during the Resource Development phase, where they created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they gathered targeted individuals' email addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves collecting email addresses from various sources, which aligns with the question's mention of gathering email addresses.
   - **T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites:** This technique involves searching for information on victim-owned websites, which can be a part of open source research.
   - **T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves compromising email accounts, which is not directly relevant to the question as it pertains to the Resource Development phase rather than the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the Reconnaissance phase, which is the phase where gathering information about the target is done.
   - The related TTPs, T1589.002 and T1594, both involve collecting information that can be used to identify and target individuals, which aligns with the question's context.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question is about the Reconnaissance phase and the related TTPs involve techniques for gathering email addresses and searching victim-owned websites, it is plausible that Charming Kitten would have used these methods to gather targeted individuals' email addresses.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
