Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access is gained using either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
2. Various social media channels are used to spearphish victims.
3. A system configuration file drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques involved:
- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves dropping a malicious file on the victim's system.
- **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves using a service or application to deliver a spearphishing attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - **Initial Access**: Gained using CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
  - **Spearphishing**: Various social media channels are used to spearphish victims (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service).
  - **Malicious File**: A system configuration file drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) (T1204.002-Malicious File).

  This sequence aligns well with the provided TTPs and the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs does not follow the described attack sequence. However, the related TTPs support the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained using a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802), which is a form of exploitation (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
- The use of social media channels for spearphishing is a specific technique (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service).
- The dropping of a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) is a form of malicious file delivery (T1204.002-Malicious File).

Given the alignment of the provided TTPs with the described attack sequence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A**
