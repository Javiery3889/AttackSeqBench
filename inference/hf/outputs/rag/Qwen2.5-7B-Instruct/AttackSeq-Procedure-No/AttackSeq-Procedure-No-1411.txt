Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Leveraging an open Weave Scope service to achieve initial access to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Scanning IP ranges to identify additional open Docker API endpoints.
3. Deploying malware via these endpoints.
4. Setting the attributes of the downloaded coin miner to immutable.
5. Performing cryptocurrency mining.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious image, which could be relevant to deploying malware.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**: This technique involves using a system to perform unauthorized computations, which aligns with cryptocurrency mining.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It involves scanning for additional endpoints, deploying malware, and performing cryptocurrency mining.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1204.003-Malicious Image and T1496.001-Compute Hijacking, support the actions of deploying malware and performing cryptocurrency mining.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that TeamTNT does not follow the steps outlined, which contradicts the detailed sequence provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions that TeamTNT is likely to follow.
- The related TTPs, T1204.003-Malicious Image and T1496.001-Compute Hijacking, support the actions of deploying malware and performing cryptocurrency mining.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
