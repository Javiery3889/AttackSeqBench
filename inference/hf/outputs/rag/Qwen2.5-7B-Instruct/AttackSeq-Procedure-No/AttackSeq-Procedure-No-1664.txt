### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where LightNeuron collects emails and local files and exfiltrates them using automated methods.
   - The question then asks if it is likely to use FTP for C&C communication instead of emails, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automated methods for exfiltrating data, which aligns with the scenario where LightNeuron uses automated collection methods.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols for C&C communication, which is relevant to the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not used for C&C, which is not directly relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that LightNeuron would use FTP for C&C communication instead of emails.
     - Given that T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols is a relevant technique for C&C communication, and FTP is a file transfer protocol, this answer aligns well with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that LightNeuron would not use FTP for C&C communication.
     - While this is possible, the question specifically asks if it is likely to use FTP for C&C communication, and the related TTPs do not provide a strong reason to believe it would not use FTP.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the use of FTP for C&C communication, as it is a relevant technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Final Answer: A
