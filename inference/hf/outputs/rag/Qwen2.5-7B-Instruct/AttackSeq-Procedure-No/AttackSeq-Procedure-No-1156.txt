Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have collected victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites. The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves the collection of credentials, which aligns with the phishing attack described in the question.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves the use of email accounts, which could be part of the phishing campaign.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop**: This technique involves stopping specific services, which is the focus of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after collecting credentials, the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1489-Service Stop, indicate that stopping services is a technique used in the impact phase of an attack. However, the question does not provide information that directly links the collection of credentials to the stopping of backup services as a prelude to password changes.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers are unlikely to stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.
  - While the related TTPs do not explicitly state that stopping services is a common step before changing passwords, the sequence of actions described in the question (phishing for credentials, then changing passwords) does not inherently require stopping services as an intermediate step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a straightforward sequence of phishing for credentials and then changing passwords. There is no indication in the related TTPs that stopping services is a necessary or common step in this sequence.
- The related TTPs focus on credential collection and impact, but do not provide a clear link between stopping services and the immediate action of changing passwords.

**Final Answer: B**
