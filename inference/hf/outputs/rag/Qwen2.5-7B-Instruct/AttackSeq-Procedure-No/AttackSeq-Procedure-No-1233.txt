Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deploying additional modules like pr.dll.
2. Uploading stolen data to the C&C server.
3. Performing discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
4. Using geographically distributed bots only afterward.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves scanning IP ranges to identify systems that are likely to be vulnerable.
- **Technique T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying services running on discovered systems.

The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only afterward. 

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Deployment of Modules**: The question mentions deploying additional modules like pr.dll, which is a common tactic used by APT groups to establish a foothold.
2. **Data Upload**: The modules are used to upload stolen data to the C&C server, indicating a data exfiltration phase.
3. **Discovery**: The question specifically asks about the discovery phase, which involves scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
4. **Geographically Distributed Bots**: The question mentions using geographically distributed bots, which is a plausible method for conducting large-scale scans and maintaining anonymity.

### Final Answer
Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
