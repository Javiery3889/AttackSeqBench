Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after data exfiltration:
1. Exfiltration via FTP.
2. Use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
3. Searching removable drives.
4. Skipping certain file types during collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration)**: This TTP is about the method of data exfiltration, which is already mentioned in the question (exfiltrating via FTP).
- **Collection (T1056.001-Keylogging)**: This TTP involves the use of a keylogger to capture keystrokes.
- **Collection (T1005-Data from Local System)**: This TTP involves gathering data from the local system, which could include searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke would use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data via FTP and after searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.
  - The related TTPs support the use of keylogging (T1056.001) and data collection from the local system (T1005), which aligns with the described sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke would not use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer in the described sequence.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate the use of keylogging and data collection from the local system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that includes keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing after exfiltrating data via FTP and after searching removable drives.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of keylogging and data collection from the local system, which supports the described sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
