Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware:
1. Establishing communication with C2 servers over HTTPS.
2. Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
3. Exfiltrating data from the infected machine to the C2.

The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use the MIME protocol for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

This indicates that the malware is likely to use a method to exfiltrate data over the established C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Establishing communication over HTTPS is a common method for C2 communication.
  - Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a common technique to avoid detection.
  - Exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel is a plausible next step.
  - The MIME protocol is a standard for encoding data in email messages, which can be used for exfiltration. However, it is not the most common method for C2 communication.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the malware is unlikely to use the MIME protocol for exfiltration, which is less likely given the context of the established C2 channel and the need for data obfuscation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already established a secure communication channel over HTTPS, which is a common method for C2 communication.
- The use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation suggests that the malware is trying to avoid detection, and MIME is a standard method for encoding data, which can be used for exfiltration.
- While MIME is a valid method, it is not the most common or efficient method for C2 communication, especially when a secure channel is already established.

Given the context and the established C2 channel, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using the established channel for exfiltration, which could include MIME as a method but is not the most likely choice.

**Final Answer: B**
