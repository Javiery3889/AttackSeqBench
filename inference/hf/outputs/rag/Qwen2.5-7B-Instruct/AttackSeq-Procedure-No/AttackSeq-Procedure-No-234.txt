Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs: a .lnk file delivering a payload, followed by a PowerShell script obfuscating its execution in memory.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will establish persistence by using Microsoft Outlook add-ins instead of creating a scheduled task.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This indicates that creating a scheduled task is a known method for malware to establish persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This further confirms that scheduled tasks are a common method for executing malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of using Microsoft Outlook add-ins for persistence instead of a scheduled task.
   - While it is possible for malware to use various methods for persistence, including add-ins, the related TTPs emphasize the use of scheduled tasks as a common and effective method.
   - The question implies a comparison between using a scheduled task and using an Outlook add-in, and the related TTPs do not provide any information that would suggest the use of Outlook add-ins as a more likely or common method.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The related TTPs focus on scheduled tasks as a method for persistence and execution.
   - There is no indication in the question or the related TTPs that using Outlook add-ins is a more likely or common method for persistence.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the malware would use Microsoft Outlook add-ins for persistence in this scenario.

**Final Answer: B: No**
