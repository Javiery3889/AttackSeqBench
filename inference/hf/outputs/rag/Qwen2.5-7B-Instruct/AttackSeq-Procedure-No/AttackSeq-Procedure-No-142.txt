Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, after leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access, the attack group likely harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which aligns with the question's focus on harvesting user's login credentials.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique involves gathering information about domains, which is more related to understanding the properties of domains rather than directly harvesting credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the technique T1589.001-Credentials, which is directly related to the question's focus on harvesting user's login credentials.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the attack group did not harvest user's login credentials and instead used phishing domains, which is less directly aligned with the question's focus on credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the likelihood of harvesting user's login credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
- The related TTP T1589.001-Credentials directly supports the harvesting of credentials.
- The related TTP T1590.001-Domain Properties, while related to reconnaissance, does not directly support the harvesting of credentials.

Given the focus of the question and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is harvesting user's login credentials.

### Final Answer: A
