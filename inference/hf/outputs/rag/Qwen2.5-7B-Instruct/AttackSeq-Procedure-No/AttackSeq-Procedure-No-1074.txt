Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper initially gains access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to download and install an MSI package. The question then asks whether, after this initial access, client software vulnerabilities like Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158 are likely to be exploited for execution instead of malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper being executed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention "Execution" and "T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution." This indicates that the focus is on the execution phase of the attack, where the adversary aims to run malicious code on the victim's system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that after the initial access, the adversary would likely exploit client software vulnerabilities like Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158 for execution.
  - This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) is a common technique used to gain further access or execute payloads.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that after the initial access, the adversary would not exploit client software vulnerabilities like Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158 for execution.
  - This would imply that the adversary would continue to rely on the already downloaded and installed MSI package to execute the backdoor's dropper.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The initial access via the Equation Editor vulnerability and the subsequent installation of an MSI package is a sophisticated method to gain initial access and establish persistence.
  - However, once the adversary has established a foothold, they are likely to continue using other vulnerabilities to maintain access and evade detection. This is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs) where adversaries often use multiple vectors to ensure their persistence.
  - The T1203 TTP, which involves exploiting client software vulnerabilities, is a standard technique to gain further access or execute payloads. It is a plausible and effective method for the adversary to maintain control and avoid detection.

- **Final Answer:**
  Final Answer: A
