Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Passive monitoring of HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns.
2. Exfiltration of collected data using the MIME protocol.
3. Capability to download additional components from a C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. This aligns with the question's mention of HTTP GET and POST requests and MIME protocol for exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves monitoring network traffic to discover information. This aligns with the question's mention of passive monitoring of HTTP requests.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions:
    1. Passive monitoring of HTTP requests (T1040-Network Sniffing).
    2. Exfiltration using MIME protocol (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
    3. Capability to download additional components from a C2 server (implied by Command and Control Tactic).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions, as it contradicts the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are consistent with the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs (T1040-Network Sniffing and T1071.001-Web Protocols) support the described sequence.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the only choice that aligns with the described sequence of actions.

### Final Answer: Yes
