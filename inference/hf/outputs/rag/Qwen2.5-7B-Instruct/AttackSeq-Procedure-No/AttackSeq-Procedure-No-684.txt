Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
3. Deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.
4. Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact
- Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Impact** - This tactic is about actions that have a direct effect on the target system, such as deleting shadow volumes, which can inhibit system recovery.
- **Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery** - This technique specifically involves actions that prevent the system from recovering from an attack, such as deleting shadow copies.

Given these related TTPs, the action of deleting shadow volumes (`vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`) aligns well with the tactic of Impact and the technique of T1490-Inhibit System Recovery. This action would indeed inhibit system recovery, which is a common goal for attackers to ensure that their actions are not easily reversible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes deleting shadow volumes.
2. The related TTPs mention the tactic of Impact and the technique of T1490-Inhibit System Recovery, which directly relate to the action of deleting shadow volumes.
3. Deleting shadow volumes is a method to inhibit system recovery, which is consistent with the tactic and technique provided.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the deletion of shadow volumes as a step to inhibit system recovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
