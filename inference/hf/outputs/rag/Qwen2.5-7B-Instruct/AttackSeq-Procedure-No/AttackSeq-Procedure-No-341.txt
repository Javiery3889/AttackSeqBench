Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions during an exploit:
1. Leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
2. Executing shellcode to make memory executable.
3. Bypassing EAF (Executable Address Filtering) mitigation.
4. Attempting to bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) protections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client system. It aligns with the initial steps of leveraging corrupted Flash objects and executing shellcode.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves exploiting a system's defenses to gain an advantage. It aligns with the steps of bypassing EAF, ASLR, and DEP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after bypassing EAF, the exploit will proceed to bypass ASLR and DEP.
  - Given the related TTPs, this sequence makes sense. After executing code and bypassing EAF, the next logical step would be to evade ASLR and DEP to ensure the shellcode can be reliably executed.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the exploit would not proceed to bypass ASLR and DEP after EAF.
  - This does not align well with the typical sequence of actions in an exploit. Bypassing ASLR and DEP is a common step in many exploits to ensure the shellcode can be reliably executed.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are part of a sophisticated exploit.
- The related TTPs indicate that bypassing defenses is a common tactic.
- The logical sequence of actions is to first leverage the vulnerability, then execute the code, and then bypass the defenses to ensure the shellcode can be reliably executed.

**Final Answer: Yes**
