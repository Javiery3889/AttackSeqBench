Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Rising Sun implant:
1. Initial reconnaissance.
2. Data exfiltration using RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding.
3. Communication with the control server using HTTP POST requests.

The question asks if it is likely that the implant would use HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding for communication with the control server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to maintain access to a network or system.
- **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves the use of standard encoding methods to obfuscate data.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used by attackers to avoid detection or analysis.
- **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves the process of removing obfuscation or decoding information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **RC4 Stream Encryption and Base64 Encoding**: These are methods used to obfuscate and encrypt data. The related TTPs mention standard encoding (T1132.001) and deobfuscation (T1140), which align with the use of Base64 encoding and RC4 encryption.
- **HTTP POST Requests**: This is a common method for data exfiltration and command and control communication. The related TTPs do not specifically mention HTTP POST requests, but they do cover the broader tactic of Command and Control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration is consistent with the related TTPs, which cover standard encoding and deobfuscation.
- HTTP POST requests are a common method for command and control communication, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- The combination of these techniques (HTTP POST, RC4 encryption, and Base64 encoding) is a plausible and effective method for maintaining stealth and evading detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
