Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Turla operators:
1. Establishing a hidden foothold in infected networks.
2. Searching other computers and storing stolen information.
3. Setting auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data.
4. Updating command and control servers to maintain control of infected systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email data from the local system.
- **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to route emails to a different address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This TTP is relevant to the first part of the sequence, where stolen information is collected from the local system.
- **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This TTP is relevant to the second part of the sequence, where auto-forward rules are set on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data.

Given the sequence described in the question, the logical next step after collecting stolen information (T1114.001) would be to set up auto-forward rules (T1114.003) to ensure that the collected data is sent to the command and control servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Establishing a foothold**: This is the initial step, which is not directly related to the TTPs but sets the stage for the subsequent actions.
2. **Collecting stolen information**: This is done using T1114.001.
3. **Setting auto-forward rules**: This is done using T1114.003 to ensure that the collected data is sent to the command and control servers.
4. **Updating command and control servers**: This is the final step to maintain control of the infected systems.

Based on the logical sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to first collect stolen information and then set up auto-forward rules to send the data to the command and control servers.

### Final Answer: A
