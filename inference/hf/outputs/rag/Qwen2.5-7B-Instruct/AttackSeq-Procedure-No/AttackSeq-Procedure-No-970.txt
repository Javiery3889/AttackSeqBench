Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names.
2. Using `verclsid.exe` to download and execute a malicious script.
3. Utilizing command-and-control infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the techniques used:
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves disguising malware to appear as legitimate files or locations.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malware to appear as legitimate files or locations.
- **T1218.012-Verclsid**: This technique involves using `verclsid.exe` to download and execute malicious scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Disguising Malware Files**: Both T1036.005 and T1036 are relevant here, as they involve disguising malware to appear legitimate.
- **Using `verclsid.exe`**: T1218.012 specifically mentions the use of `verclsid.exe` to download and execute malicious scripts.
- **Command-and-Control Infrastructure**: While not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, the use of DynDNS services for C2 infrastructure is a common technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, but it is not directly listed here.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The first step, disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names, is covered by T1036.005 and T1036.
2. The second step, using `verclsid.exe` to download and execute a malicious script, is directly covered by T1218.012.
3. The third step, utilizing command-and-control infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services, is a common technique but not directly listed in the related TTPs.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Disguising malware files (T1036.005 or T1036)
- Using `verclsid.exe` to download and execute a malicious script (T1218.012)
- Utilizing command-and-control infrastructure (not directly listed but common)

### Final Answer: A: Yes
