Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence involving:
1. Gaining initial access through malicious LNK files.
2. Delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
3. The question then asks whether SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056-Input Capture**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This technique involves hooking into API calls to capture credentials. This is directly related to the tactic of Credential Access.
- **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or mouse movements. This is related to the tactic of Collection.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The question specifically asks about capturing mouse movements or performing API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.
- T1056.004-Credential API Hooking is directly related to capturing credentials, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.
- T1056-Input Capture is related to capturing user input, which includes mouse movements, aligning with the Collection tactic.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve capturing user input (mouse movements) and then performing API hooking to capture credentials. This sequence aligns with the related TTPs and the overall attack sequence described.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
