### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a backdoor (Dropping Elephant) steals Google Chrome credentials and other data.
   - It then asks if the file-stealer module is likely to upload files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories to collect them.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves the collection of data from the local system, which aligns with the backdoor stealing credentials and data.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automated collection of data, which could include the uploading of files with specific extensions.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which could be part of the process of iterating through directories to collect files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will upload files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories.
     - Given the techniques T1119 and T1083, it is plausible that the module would first upload files with specific extensions and then proceed to iterate through directories to collect more files.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will not upload files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories.
     - This seems less plausible because the techniques mentioned (T1119 and T1083) imply a process that involves both uploading and discovering files.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
