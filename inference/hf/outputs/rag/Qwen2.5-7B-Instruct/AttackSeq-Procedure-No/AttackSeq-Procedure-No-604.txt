Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Gaining execution through the Delphi downloader.
2. Using Windows API to execute commands.
3. Sending gathered system information to the C&C server.

The question then asks whether the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform system service discovery to obtain information about services on the victim's machine.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker discovering services running on the target system.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker gathering information about the target system, which can include service information.

Given that the question mentions sending "gathered system information to the C&C server," it implies that the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader is performing some form of system information discovery. Since T1007 specifically targets service discovery, it is a more precise match for the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions leading to the gathering of system information.
2. The related TTPs include both system service discovery and system information discovery.
3. T1007 (System Service Discovery) is a more specific technique that aligns with the question's focus on discovering services.
4. The AutoIt downloader, as part of the Sednit group, is likely to perform detailed system information discovery, which includes service discovery.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the AutoIt downloader will indeed perform system service discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
