Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Dragonfly group:
1. **Defense Evasion**: Using self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Moving among internal or external systems.
3. **Discovery**: Focusing on Windows systems to gather system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal)**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
- **Lateral Movement (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol)**: This technique involves using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move between systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It suggests that after using self-deleting code (Defense Evasion), the group would use RDP (Lateral Movement) to move between systems and then focus on Windows systems for discovery.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the group did not use RDP for lateral movement, which contradicts the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the group first evades detection by removing traces of their presence, then moves laterally using RDP, and finally focuses on Windows systems for discovery.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of RDP for lateral movement and the focus on Windows systems for discovery.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
