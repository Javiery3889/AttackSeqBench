Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by DNSpionage attackers:
1. Resource development by generating Let's Encrypt certificates for redirected domains related to fake websites.
2. Targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers.
3. Employing password-protected macros in malicious Microsoft Office documents to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about potential victims to tailor attacks.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves delivering malware through a malicious attachment, often via a targeted email.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.
  - The reconnaissance and gathering of victim identity information (T1589) aligns with the targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers.
  - The use of spearphishing attachments (T1566.001) aligns with the delivery of password-protected macros in malicious Microsoft Office documents.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not plausible.
  - There is no direct contradiction in the related TTPs that would make this sequence implausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The DNSpionage attackers' actions align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The reconnaissance and gathering of victim identity information (T1589) are necessary steps before conducting targeted surveillance (activists and bloggers).
- The use of spearphishing attachments (T1566.001) is a common method to deliver malware, such as password-protected macros, to evade detection.

Given the alignment of the related TTPs with the described sequence of actions, the most plausible sequence is indeed the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
