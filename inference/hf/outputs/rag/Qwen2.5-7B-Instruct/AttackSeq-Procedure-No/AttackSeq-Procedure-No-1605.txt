Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting.
2. Exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.
3. Initial access through malicious LNK files.
4. Delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, which aligns with the use of malicious LNK files.
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate application, which can be part of a convoluted infection chain.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that SideCopy (DLL Side-Loading) is likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
  - The related TTPs (T1204-User Execution and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) support this sequence of TTPs. T1204-User Execution explains the initial access through malicious LNK files, and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading explains the delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that SideCopy is unlikely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases under the described conditions.
  - There is no direct evidence in the related TTPs to support this claim. The related TTPs do not contradict the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence involving initial access through malicious LNK files (T1204-User Execution) and a convoluted infection chain (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading).
- The related TTPs support this sequence, indicating that the malware could indeed use DLL Side-Loading to deliver payloads and potentially exfiltrate data.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
