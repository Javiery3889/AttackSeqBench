Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The malware executes system information discovery commands.
2. The results are returned to the C&C server.
3. The malware then uses a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network.
4. The malware attempts communication with its C&C infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves gathering information about the network environment, which aligns with the initial system information discovery.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves using network sniffing to capture user credentials, which aligns with the step where the malware discovers user credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial discovery of system information and communication with the C&C server, the malware will use a network sniffer to discover user credentials.
  - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs, as it involves both network sniffing for discovery and credential access.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use a network sniffer to discover user credentials after the initial steps.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as it does not include the step of network sniffing for credential access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes network sniffing for credential access, which is directly supported by the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs explicitly mention the use of network sniffing for both discovery and credential access.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes network sniffing for credential access.

**Final Answer: A**
