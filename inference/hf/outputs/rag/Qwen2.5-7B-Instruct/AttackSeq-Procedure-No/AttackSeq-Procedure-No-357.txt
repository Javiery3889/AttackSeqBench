Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Nidiran backdoor communicates victim’s network details to C&C domains.
2. Suckfly scans the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
3. Suckfly uses hacktools to transfer malware laterally across the e-commerce company's internal network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves using tools to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying open ports and services on the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is relevant to the scanning of the internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
- **Technique T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique is relevant to the transfer of malware laterally across the network.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Nidiran backdoor communicates victim’s network details to C&C domains**: This is the initial step where the attacker gains initial access and gathers information about the network.
2. **Suckfly scans the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports**: This aligns with the T1046-Network Service Discovery technique, which is a logical next step to identify potential targets for lateral movement.
3. **Suckfly uses hacktools to transfer malware laterally across the e-commerce company's internal network**: This aligns with the T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer technique, which is the final step in the described sequence.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
