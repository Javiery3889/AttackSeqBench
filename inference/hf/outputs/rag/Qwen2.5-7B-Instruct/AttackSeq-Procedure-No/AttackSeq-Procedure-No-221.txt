Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a Shellbot has established C&C (Command and Control) communication using an IRC channel. The next step in the sequence is to gather specific information about the infected host, including:
- Number of processor cores
- Type of processor
- Presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to find information about the target environment. It aligns with the question's context of gathering information about the infected host.
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique specifically involves gathering information about the system, such as system details, network details, and software installed on the system. This technique directly relates to the information being gathered in the question.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the Shellbot is likely to use the T1082-System Information Discovery technique to gather the specific information mentioned (number of processor cores, type of processor, and presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Shellbot will gather this information as part of the Discovery tactic using the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
