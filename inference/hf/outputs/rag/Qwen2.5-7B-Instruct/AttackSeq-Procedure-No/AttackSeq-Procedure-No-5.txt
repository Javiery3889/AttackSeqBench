Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where recipients are initially presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report. This is followed by spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 for the delivery of QuasarRAT. The question asks if it is likely that recipients will only get infected with QuasarRAT after being infected with QuasarRAT, which seems to be a paradoxical statement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spear phishing email to gain initial access to the victim's system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the recipients will only get infected with QuasarRAT after being infected with QuasarRAT, which is logically inconsistent. It implies a circular or redundant infection process, which is not typical in cyber attacks.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the recipients will not only get infected with QuasarRAT after being infected with QuasarRAT, which is logically consistent with the described attack sequence. The initial spear phishing attack with the RTF document exploiting CVE-2017-8750 would deliver QuasarRAT, and there is no indication of a secondary infection with QuasarRAT.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the question involves a spear phishing email with an RTF document exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT. There is no indication of a secondary infection with QuasarRAT.
- The related TTPs, T1203 and T1566.001, support the idea of an initial exploit and spear phishing attack, but do not suggest a redundant infection process.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the recipients will not only get infected with QuasarRAT after being infected with QuasarRAT.

**Final Answer: No**
