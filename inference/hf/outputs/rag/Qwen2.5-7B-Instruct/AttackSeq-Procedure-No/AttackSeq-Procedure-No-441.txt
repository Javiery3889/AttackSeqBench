Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Waterbear's backdoor has been configured with an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address. It then asks whether API hooking techniques are likely to be used to evade detection by modifying specific functions in memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions that are not easily detected by security software.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking or obfuscating indicators of compromise to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **API Hooking (T1106-Native API)**: This technique is commonly used to modify the behavior of system functions, which can help in evading detection by security software. Modifying functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' can help in hiding malicious activities or evading detection mechanisms.
- **Indicator Blocking (T1562.006-Defense Evasion)**: This technique is about hiding or obfuscating indicators of compromise, which is a different approach from directly modifying system functions.

Given that the question specifically mentions modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory, this aligns more closely with the use of API hooking techniques (T1106-Native API) rather than just blocking indicators.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a scenario where the backdoor is configured with encryption and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address, indicating a need to maintain stealth and evade detection.
2. The related TTPs mention API hooking, which is a technique used to modify system functions to evade detection.
3. The specific mention of modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' functions in memory aligns with the use of API hooking techniques.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of API hooking techniques to modify system functions to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
