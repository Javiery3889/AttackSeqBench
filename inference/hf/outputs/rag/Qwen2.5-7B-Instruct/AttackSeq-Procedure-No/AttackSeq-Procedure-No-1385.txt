Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13:
1. **Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE**: This establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution.
2. **Persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries**: This ensures the attacker can maintain long-term access.
3. **Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access**: This suggests a method to gain initial access to the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique involves deploying web shells for persistence.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question asks about initial access, which is typically the first step in an attack sequence.
- **Persistence**: SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are used for persistence, which is a later step.
- **Exploiting External Servers**: Deploying web shells and custom malware for initial access is a method to gain initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question suggests that after establishing persistence, the attacker might use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
2. **Persistence**: SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are used for persistence, which is a different phase of the attack.
3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described in the question (passive backdoors, persistence, and then initial access via external servers) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes

The sequence described in the question is a plausible attack sequence, where persistence is established first, and then the attacker uses external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
