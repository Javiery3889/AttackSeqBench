Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a spearphishing campaign where Mustang Panda uses a double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to evade defenses. The question then asks if Mustang Panda is likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1090-Proxy)**: This tactic involves the attacker using a proxy to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. A reverse SOCKS proxy is a type of proxy that can be used for this purpose.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1036.007-Double File Extension)**: This technique involves using a double file extension to evade file filters and antivirus software. This is the method described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Mustang Panda would use a reverse SOCKS proxy module. Given the related TTPs, this aligns well with the tactic of Command and Control, which often involves using proxies to maintain communication with the C2 server.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Mustang Panda would not use a reverse SOCKS proxy module. However, the related TTPs do not provide any direct evidence against the use of a reverse SOCKS proxy, and it is a common technique in the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a spearphishing campaign using a double extension trick, which is a method of Defense Evasion.
- The related TTPs include Command and Control, which often involves using proxies for communication with the C2 server.
- A reverse SOCKS proxy is a common method for Command and Control communication, as it allows the attacker to maintain a covert channel for data exfiltration or command execution.
- Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that Mustang Panda would likely use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

### Final Answer: A
