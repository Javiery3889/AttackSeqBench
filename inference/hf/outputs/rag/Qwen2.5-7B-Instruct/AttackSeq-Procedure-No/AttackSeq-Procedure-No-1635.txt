Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The adversary uses a PowerShell one-liner to install a Cobalt Strike beacon.
2. Before this, the adversary leverages scheduled tasks to execute a batch file.
3. The batch file is used to perform tasks.
4. The adversary then accesses the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to run malicious code. This aligns with the part of the question where the adversary uses scheduled tasks to execute a batch file.
- The question asks if it is likely that the adversary used scheduled tasks before installing the Cobalt Strike beacon. This implies that the scheduled task is part of the initial steps leading to the installation of the beacon.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Scheduled Task Execution**: The adversary uses a scheduled task to execute a batch file. This is a common technique to ensure that malicious code runs at a specific time or under specific conditions.
2. **Batch File Execution**: The batch file is executed, which could contain commands or scripts that perform various tasks, such as credential harvesting or other preparatory actions.
3. **Password Spraying**: After the batch file execution, the adversary uses the obtained credentials through password spraying to access the victim's network.
4. **Cobalt Strike Beacon Installation**: Finally, the adversary installs the Cobalt Strike beacon using a PowerShell one-liner.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the use of scheduled tasks as a preparatory step. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

Final Answer: A
