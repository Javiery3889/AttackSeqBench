Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exfiltrating processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.
2. Collecting data from removable media.
3. Targeting relevant folders.
4. Discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.
5. Staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Collection**
- **Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves the attacker staging data locally before exfiltration. This aligns with the action of staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment, which aligns with discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The sequence described in the question suggests a logical flow of actions: exfiltration, data collection, targeting, discovery, and staging.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1074.001-Local Data Staging, support the action of staging data in the %TEMP% folder.
- The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer collected data from removable media and targeted relevant folders after discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration and staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

Given the logical flow and the support from the related TTPs, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
