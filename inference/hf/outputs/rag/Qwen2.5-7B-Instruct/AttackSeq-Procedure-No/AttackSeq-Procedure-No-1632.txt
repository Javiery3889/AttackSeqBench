Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an adversary has compressed and encrypted large chunks of data and is preparing to exfiltrate them. The specific condition mentioned is that if the file size is 0x1000000 bytes (16MB) or more, the adversary will divide the files before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint**: This technique involves the adversary collecting data from Microsoft SharePoint Online. This is relevant to the question as it specifies the source of the data.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves the adversary managing the size of data being exfiltrated, often to avoid detection or to comply with specific transfer limitations.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the condition specified in the question. If the file size is 16MB or more, the adversary will divide the files. This is consistent with the technique of managing data transfer size limits (T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the adversary does not divide files based on the size condition, which contradicts the specific condition mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies a condition where files larger than 16MB are divided before exfiltration.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, support the idea of managing data transfer sizes.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is consistent with the condition and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Final Answer: A
