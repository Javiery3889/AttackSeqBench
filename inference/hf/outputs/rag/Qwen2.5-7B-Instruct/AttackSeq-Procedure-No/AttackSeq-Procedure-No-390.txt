Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors use AtomBombing to inject malicious code and then execute it via legitimate programs.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they will use a VBA script, embedded within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves using templates to evade detection. While it is related to evasion, it does not directly link to the use of VBA scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code. This is directly relevant to the use of VBA scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the use of VBA scripts, which is a common method for executing malicious code within a Word document. VBA scripts can be embedded in documents and executed when the document is opened, making them a stealthy and effective method for threat actors.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the use of VBA scripts, which is a well-known and effective method for executing malicious code within documents.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where threat actors use AtomBombing to inject malicious code and then execute it via legitimate programs.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1059.005-Visual Basic, directly support the use of VBA scripts.
   - VBA scripts are commonly used to embed malicious code within documents, such as Word documents, and can be executed when the document is opened, making them a plausible and effective method for threat actors.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
