Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. DLL side-loading is used to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload.
2. The final payload is likely to use secondary C2 servers for communication.
3. The final connection is made to the command and control server at IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the attack techniques:
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages or channels for communication, which aligns with the use of secondary C2 servers.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which could be relevant if the final connection uses a non-standard port (though the question does not specify this).
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves using DLL side-loading to execute code, which aligns with the initial step described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of secondary C2 servers (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels) and the final connection to the command and control server (160.20.147.254 on port 9999).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the use of secondary C2 servers and the final connection to the command and control server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence that includes the use of DLL side-loading to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload.
- The attack then uses secondary C2 servers for communication, which is a common technique to evade detection and provide a fallback in case the primary C2 server is taken down.
- The final connection is made to the command and control server at IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999, which is a specific and likely non-standard port, further supporting the use of secondary C2 servers.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
