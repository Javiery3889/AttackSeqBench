Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.
2. Distributing via spearphishing links containing malicious files.
3. Injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain to introduce malicious firmware or hardware into devices.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malicious content to the target.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It starts with exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities (T1195.003), then uses spearphishing (T1566.002) to distribute malicious files, and finally injects additional modules into device memory.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the malware does not use spearphishing or inject additional modules, which contradicts the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that starts with exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities, then uses spearphishing to distribute malicious files, and finally injects additional modules into device memory.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of both supply chain compromise and spearphishing as initial access techniques.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the only option that correctly follows the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: Yes
