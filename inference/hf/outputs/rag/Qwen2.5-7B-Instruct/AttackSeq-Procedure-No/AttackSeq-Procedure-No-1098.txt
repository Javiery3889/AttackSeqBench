Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by CosmicDuke:
1. Searching removable drives.
2. Skipping certain file types during collection.
3. Compressing output data generated by command execution with a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm.
4. Exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves compressing data using a standard library.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves compressing data using a custom method.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique does not align with the question because it involves using a standard library for compression, not a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique aligns with the question because it involves using a custom method for compression, which matches the description of a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for compression.
- T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method is the only related TTP that involves custom compression, which aligns with the question.
- T1560.002-Archive via Library does not match the custom implementation mentioned in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question, which aligns with T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method.

**Final Answer: A**
