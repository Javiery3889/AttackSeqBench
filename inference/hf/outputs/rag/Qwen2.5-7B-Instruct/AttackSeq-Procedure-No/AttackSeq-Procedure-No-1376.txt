Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT28's malicious document uses DDE via PowerShell to achieve execution. It then asks if it is likely to observe the document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
  - This technique involves modifying the system's search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is a method to evade detection and ensure persistence.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**
  - This technique involves using DDE to execute code, often through a malicious document or script.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the document hijacks legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup. This aligns with the tactic of Defense Evasion, where the malware would use legitimate startup scripts to ensure persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the document does not hijack legitimate application-specific startup scripts. This would mean the malware relies on other methods to ensure persistence, which is less likely given the context of the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware uses DDE to achieve execution. This is a method to gain initial access and execute code.
- The malware then needs to ensure persistence, which is a common requirement for APTs.
- Hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts is a well-known method to ensure persistence and evade detection. This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic and the use of legitimate mechanisms to maintain a foothold on the system.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking, also indicate the use of legitimate mechanisms to ensure persistence.

### Final Answer: Yes
