Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The attack group secures alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
2. They exploit an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into the victim networks.
3. They gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means, including phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The question mentions securing alternative means of persistence, which aligns with the persistence techniques (T1078.002-Domain Accounts and T1078-Valid Accounts).
- **Exploitation**: The question states that the group exploits an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. This is a specific technique that can be used to gain a foothold, but it is not directly listed in the related TTPs. However, it is a plausible method for gaining initial access.
- **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions gathering user credentials through phishing domains. This aligns with the reconnaissance technique (T1589.001-Credentials).

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Persistence**: The attack group secures alternative means of persistence, which can be achieved through various techniques, including T1078.002-Domain Accounts and T1078-Valid Accounts.
2. **Exploitation**: The group exploits an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold. While this is not directly listed in the related TTPs, it is a plausible method for gaining initial access.
3. **Reconnaissance**: The group gathers user credentials through phishing domains, which aligns with the reconnaissance technique (T1589.001-Credentials).

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
