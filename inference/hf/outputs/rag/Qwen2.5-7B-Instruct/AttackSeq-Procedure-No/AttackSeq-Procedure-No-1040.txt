### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through exploiting the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will create a scheduled task to establish persistence before deploying a PowerShell backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain access to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The initial access is gained through a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882), which is a form of exploitation for client execution.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of creating a scheduled task for persistence.
   - The related TTPs confirm that creating a scheduled task is a common method for establishing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the attackers have already gained initial access through a specific vulnerability, it is highly likely that they would use a technique like creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - The related TTPs support the use of scheduled tasks as a method for persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
