Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering credentials using tools like ChromePass and Lazagne.
2. Asking if Buckeye is likely to steal emails from Microsoft Exchange servers during the collection phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**: This technique involves the collection of email data from remote email servers.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing or otherwise obtaining credentials from password stores.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the TTPs provided. After gathering credentials (T1555), it is plausible that the attacker (Buckeye) would use these credentials to access remote email servers (T1114.002).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the TTPs provided. If Buckeye has gathered credentials, it would be reasonable to assume they would use these credentials to access email servers, especially if the question is asking about the collection phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: Buckeye gathers credentials using tools like ChromePass and Lazagne (T1555).
- **Step 2**: With these credentials, Buckeye can then access remote email servers (T1114.002).
- **Step 3**: The collection phase typically involves gathering as much data as possible, which would include emails from Microsoft Exchange servers.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Buckeye would indeed steal emails from Microsoft Exchange servers during the collection phase.

**Final Answer: A**
