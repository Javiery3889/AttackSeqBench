### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether other macOS malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) would employ their mechanisms for gaining initial access only after CrateDepression has dropped its Poseidon payloads.
   - The key point is the sequence of actions: initial access by other malware versus the action of CrateDepression dropping its payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves the use of malicious files to execute code. This is relevant to the payload delivery mechanism of CrateDepression.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks** - This technique involves checking user activity to evade detection. This is more about post-infection behavior and not directly related to initial access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads** - This technique involves embedding payloads within legitimate files or processes to evade detection. This is also related to the payload delivery mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If other macOS malware were to wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads, it would imply a sequential attack where one malware (CrateDepression) must first infect the system before other malware can gain initial access.
     - This scenario is highly unlikely because different malware often have different goals and methods of initial access. They would not wait for another piece of malware to drop its payload before they act.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that other macOS malware would not wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads before gaining initial access. This is more plausible because different malware often have independent methods of initial access and do not rely on each other to infect systems.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
