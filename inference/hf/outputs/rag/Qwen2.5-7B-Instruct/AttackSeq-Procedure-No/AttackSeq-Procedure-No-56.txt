Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether Lazarus (a known APT group) would ensure that web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to it. The key points are:
- The action is related to the "Discovery" tactic.
- The specific TTPs mentioned are "System Network Connections Discovery" and "Internet Connection Discovery."

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering network connections and services on the target system.
- **T1016.001 - Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering whether the target system has an internet connection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - If Lazarus ensures that web servers are Internet accessible, it would likely involve checking for internet connectivity (T1016.001) before proceeding with further actions.
  - Once internet connectivity is confirmed, the adversary might then use T1049 to discover network connections and services, including web servers.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - If Lazarus does not ensure that web servers are Internet accessible, it would be less likely to proceed with discovery activities that assume internet connectivity.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question implies a logical sequence where internet connectivity is a prerequisite for further discovery activities.
  - T1016.001 (Internet Connection Discovery) is a foundational step that would need to be completed before T1049 (System Network Connections Discovery) can be effectively executed.
  - Ensuring internet accessibility is a critical step in the attack lifecycle, especially for APT groups like Lazarus, who often use the internet to exfiltrate data or to communicate with command and control servers.

- **Final Answer**: Final Answer: A
