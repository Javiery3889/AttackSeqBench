Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Tortoiseshell executed 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance.
2. Tortoiseshell performed discovery.
3. Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app.

The question asks if it is likely that Tortoiseshell conducted pre-compromise web searches for victim information before these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves using network tools to discover information about the target network.
- **T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is not directly related to the question.
- **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying software on the target system, which is related to the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe'.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This TTP is about discovering network information, which is part of the reconnaissance phase but does not directly indicate web searches for victim information.
- **T1518-Software Discovery**: This TTP is about identifying software on the target system, which aligns with the use of 'bird.exe' for discovery. However, it does not directly indicate web searches for victim information.
- The question asks about pre-compromise web searches for victim information, which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The provided TTPs do not explicitly mention web searches for victim information.
- While reconnaissance and discovery are part of the process, the specific TTPs provided do not directly support the claim of pre-compromise web searches for victim information.
- The question asks for a likelihood, and based on the provided TTPs, there is no direct evidence to support the claim of web searches for victim information.

### Final Answer: B: No
