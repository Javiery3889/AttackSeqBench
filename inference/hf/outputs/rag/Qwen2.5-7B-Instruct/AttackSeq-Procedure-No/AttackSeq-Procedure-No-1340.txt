Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed the use of two different single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers. The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers rebooted the target system after wiping processes were complete, rather than launching DDoS attacks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
  - This technique involves using encryption or encoding to hide the true nature of files, which aligns with the use of XOR keys to encode configuration files.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**
  - This technique involves causing a denial of service on an endpoint, which could be a DDoS attack or other forms of service disruption.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - If the attackers rebooted the target system after wiping processes, it would be a form of defense evasion, as it would reset the system state and potentially hide evidence of the attack. This aligns with the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique.
  - However, rebooting the system would not directly cause a DDoS attack or a 'total failure' of the network, which is described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - If the attackers did not reboot the system and instead launched DDoS attacks, this would align with the T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service technique. The question mentions that the DDoS attacks were against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the attackers used XOR keys to encode configuration files, which is a form of defense evasion (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File).
- The question also mentions that the attackers caused a 'total failure' of the network, which aligns with the T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service technique.
- Rebooting the system after wiping processes would be a form of defense evasion but would not directly cause the DDoS attacks or the 'total failure' of the network.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers did not reboot the system and instead launched DDoS attacks.

**Final Answer: B**
