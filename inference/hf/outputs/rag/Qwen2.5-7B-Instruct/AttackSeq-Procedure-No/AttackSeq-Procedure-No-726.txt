Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
2. The question then asks if it is likely that Stuxnet will use FTP for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This TTP aligns with the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) for lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This TTP suggests that Stuxnet might use FTP for transferring files, which could include system information and commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of FTP for C2 communication, which is a known technique for Stuxnet.
  - FTP is a common protocol for file transfer and can be used for both sending system information and receiving commands or updates.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that Stuxnet does not use FTP for C2 communication, which contradicts the known behavior of Stuxnet.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Stuxnet is known to use various methods for C2 communication, including FTP.
- The related TTPs indicate that FTP is a valid technique for file transfer in the context of C2 communication.
- The question specifically asks about the likelihood of Stuxnet using FTP for C2 communication after exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

Given the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Stuxnet would indeed use FTP for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
