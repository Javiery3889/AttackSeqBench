Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration phases.
   - It mentions that the callCam app collects extensive information during the Discovery phase.
   - It then asks if ARP cache poisoning is likely to occur during the Collection phase.
   - Finally, it mentions that the data is sent to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This TTP is related to ARP cache poisoning but is under the Credential Access tactic, not the Collection or Exfiltration phases.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This TTP is related to exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the Exfiltration phase.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This TTP is directly related to ARP cache poisoning and is under the Collection tactic, which aligns with the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about ARP cache poisoning during the Collection phase.
   - The related TTPs show that ARP cache poisoning is indeed a technique under the Collection tactic.
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest ARP cache poisoning is unlikely to occur during the Collection phase.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where ARP cache poisoning is mentioned as a technique under the Collection tactic.
   - There is no information provided that would indicate ARP cache poisoning is not likely to occur during the Collection phase.
   - The related TTPs support the likelihood of ARP cache poisoning occurring during the Collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
