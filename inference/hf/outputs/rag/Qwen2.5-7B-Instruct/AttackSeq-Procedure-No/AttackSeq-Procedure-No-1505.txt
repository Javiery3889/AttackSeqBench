Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. RIG EK's exploit server returning encrypted exploit code.
2. The use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel.
3. The use of proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1090-Proxy)**: This TTP involves the use of proxy servers to facilitate command and control operations.
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography)**: This TTP involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to secure communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) to make infections harder to detect.
  - It also aligns with the use of symmetric cryptography (like RC4) for securing communications (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the use of proxy servers or symmetric cryptography as described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm to establish an encrypted channel, which is a form of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography).
- The question also mentions that proxy servers are used to make infections harder to detect, which is a TTP related to Command and Control (T1090-Proxy).
- Both of these TTPs are directly related to the described sequence of actions in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
