Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by TG1021:
1. Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
2. Dropping a NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.
3. Performing reconnaissance and gathering output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to the target system, which aligns with the second part of the question where TG1021 drops a web shell loader.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's file and directory structure, which aligns with the third part of the question where TG1021 performs reconnaissance and gathers output files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit.
  - SharpHound and PowerSploit are tools that can be used for file and directory discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).
  - The sequence of actions described in the question aligns well with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that TG1021 did not perform reconnaissance and gather output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit.
  - This contradicts the information provided in the question and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that aligns with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.
- SharpHound and PowerSploit are tools that can be used for file and directory discovery, which is a part of the Discovery phase.
- The sequence of actions described in the question (accessing shared folders, dropping a web shell, and performing reconnaissance) is consistent with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
