Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the SUNBURST backdoor is injected into the Orion source code. It then asks if SUNSPOT (a related TTP) is likely to monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information to discover running processes on the target system. This is directly relevant to the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or information difficult to detect, analyze, or understand. While this is a relevant technique, it does not directly address the process discovery aspect of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - SUNSPOT, as a TTP, is likely to be involved in the Discovery tactic, which includes process discovery (T1057). Monitoring running processes for specific instances (like MsBuild.exe) is a common method to identify and analyze the environment, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that SUNSPOT is not involved in the Discovery tactic, which contradicts the context provided by the related TTPs, particularly T1057-Process Discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the likelihood of SUNSPOT monitoring running processes for MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.
- The related TTPs, especially T1057-Process Discovery, confirm that process discovery is a part of the Discovery tactic.
- SUNSPOT, being a TTP, is likely to be involved in the Discovery tactic, and monitoring processes is a common method for this tactic.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
