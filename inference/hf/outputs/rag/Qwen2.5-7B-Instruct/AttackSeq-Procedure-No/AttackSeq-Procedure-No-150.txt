Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets, given that they exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or downloading a malicious file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique aligns with the described method of exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
- **Technique T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves a watering hole attack, which is a method of compromising a system by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website. However, the question does not provide any information that suggests TG1021 used a malicious website to compromise targets.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that TG1021 exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
- There is no information provided that suggests TG1021 used a watering hole attack (T1189) to compromise targets.
- The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets instead, and based on the information provided, there is no evidence to support this.

### Final Answer: B: No
