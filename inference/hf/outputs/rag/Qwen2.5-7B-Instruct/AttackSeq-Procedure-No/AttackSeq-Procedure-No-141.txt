Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence that starts with leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access into a victim network. It then asks if it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials only after performing the initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means, including phishing.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique involves gathering information about the properties of a domain, which could be used to create convincing phishing domains.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Exploitation of Vulnerability)**: The question mentions that the attack group used an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access. This is a common TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Phishing Domains for Credential Gathering**: The related TTPs suggest that the attack group might use phishing domains to gather credentials. This aligns with the technique T1589.001-Credentials, which involves using phishing to obtain credentials.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The attack group successfully exploited an unpatched vulnerability to gain initial access to the network.
2. **Phishing Domains**: After gaining initial access, the attack group likely used phishing domains to gather user credentials. This is a common follow-up tactic to maintain persistence and gather sensitive information.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials after performing the initial access. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
