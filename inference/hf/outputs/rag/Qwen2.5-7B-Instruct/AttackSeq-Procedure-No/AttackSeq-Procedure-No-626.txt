Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
2. It then asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This indicates that the CostaRicto Campaign uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests that data exfiltration is done over the same C2 channel.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted non-C2 protocol.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
  - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1048.003, this is plausible because it explicitly mentions exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will not exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
  - This is less likely because the related TTPs do not explicitly rule out this behavior, and T1048.003 supports the possibility of exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CostaRicto Campaign uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication.
- The SombRAT backdoor is likely to follow similar patterns for data exfiltration.
- The related TTPs, especially T1048.003, indicate that exfiltration can occur over unencrypted non-C2 protocols.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the SombRAT backdoor could exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

**Final Answer: A**
