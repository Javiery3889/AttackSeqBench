Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions after the SLUB backdoor has downloaded a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsed it for commands.
   - The sequence in the question is: 
     1. Downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub.
     2. Parsing the 'gist' snippet for commands.
     3. Exfiltrating data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders.
     4. Posting download links to the Slack channel.
     5. Building CAB files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves archiving collected data, which aligns with the step of creating archive files.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is relevant to the step of parsing commands and collecting data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the step of posting download links to the Slack channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if the attackers are likely to exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders, posting download links to the Slack channel, and then building CAB files.
   - The related TTPs confirm that creating archive files (T1560) and exfiltrating data over a C2 channel (T1041) are common techniques used in cyber attacks.
   - The step of building CAB files is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible step in the process of preparing data for exfiltration, especially if the data is to be sent over a C2 channel.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1560 and T1041.
   - The creation of archive files (T1560) and exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041) are consistent with the described actions.
   - The step of building CAB files, while not explicitly mentioned, is a reasonable step in the process of preparing data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
