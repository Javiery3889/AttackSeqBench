Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware:
1. Utilizing defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation.
2. Decoding information related to the SombRAT backdoor.
3. Identifying the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host.
4. Archiving collected data using a custom storage file format.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
- **Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques used by the attacker to avoid detection by the defender. Process injection and deobfuscation are common techniques under this tactic.
- **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Technique)**: This technique involves the attacker decoding or deobfuscating information to reveal its true nature, which aligns with the question's description of decoding information related to the SombRAT backdoor.

Given these TTPs, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the use of defense evasion techniques to decode information and then proceed with further actions.

### Step 4: Determine the Plausible Sequence
- **Identifying the installed anti-virus product**: This step is a logical next step after decoding the information. The malware would need to know what anti-virus product is installed to tailor its actions accordingly.
- **Archiving collected data using a custom storage file format**: This is a common action for malware to ensure the persistence and confidentiality of the stolen data.

### Step 5: Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware will indeed identify the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host before archiving collected data using a custom storage file format.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
