Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys.
2. Malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will query the registry for installed applications as part of software discovery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the environment, which is a common step in the discovery phase.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves modifying registry run keys to achieve persistence, which aligns with the first part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (T1547.001)**: The malware has already achieved persistence by adding files to registry run keys.
- **Defense Evasion (T1076)**: Impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable is a form of defense evasion.
- **Software Discovery (T1012)**: Querying the registry for installed applications is a common step in software discovery, which is a tactic that often follows persistence and defense evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already achieved persistence, which is a prerequisite for further actions.
2. Impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable is a form of defense evasion, which helps the malware avoid detection.
3. After achieving persistence and evading detection, the next logical step is to gather information about the environment, which includes discovering installed applications.
4. Querying the registry for installed applications (T1012) is a common technique used in the discovery phase to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

Given this reasoning, it is highly likely that the malware will query the registry for installed applications as part of software discovery.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
