Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker named FamousSparrow:
1. Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access).
2. Retrieving metadata for files on disk.
3. Listing the current working directory.
4. Reading file contents.
5. Exfiltrating the file contents to a Command and Control (C&C) server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique is about destroying data, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories, which aligns with the actions of retrieving metadata and listing the current working directory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow would perform the actions described in the question.
  - The related TTPs (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) support the actions of retrieving metadata and listing the current working directory, which are part of the Discovery phase.
  - The sequence of actions (dumping credentials, then performing Discovery activities) is plausible and follows a typical attack pattern.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow would not perform the actions described in the question.
  - There is no direct evidence from the related TTPs that would support this choice. The actions described in the question are consistent with the Discovery phase and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are part of the Discovery phase, which is supported by the related TTPs (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).
- The actions of retrieving metadata and listing the current working directory are typical activities in the Discovery phase.
- The sequence of actions (dumping credentials, then performing Discovery activities) is a plausible and common attack pattern.

**Final Answer: A**
