Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Evading detection through overlay screens during the installation of the payload app.
2. Encrypting data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration to the C&C server.
3. Collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving or compressing data before exfiltration. While it is related to data exfiltration, it does not directly address the encryption or the collection of files and screenshots.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection. This is relevant to the encryption of data.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This is also relevant to the initial evasion through overlay screens.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the initial evasion through overlay screens (related to T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information), the encryption of data using RSA and AES (related to T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File), and the exfiltration of collected files and screenshots (related to T1560-Archive Collected Data).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the callCam app does not use encryption or does not collect and exfiltrate files and screenshots, which contradicts the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes evasion, encryption, and exfiltration.
- The related TTPs support the use of encryption (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File) and the collection of data (T1560-Archive Collected Data).
- The sequence described in the question is consistent with the use of encryption and the collection of files and screenshots.

**Final Answer: Yes**
