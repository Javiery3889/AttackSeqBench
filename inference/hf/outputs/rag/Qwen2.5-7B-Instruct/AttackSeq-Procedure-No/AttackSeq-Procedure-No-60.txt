Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether Grandoreiro (a malware or threat actor) is likely to restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot**
  - This technique involves restarting a system in safe mode to avoid detection by security software or to perform actions that would otherwise be blocked.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system and installed security products, to understand the environment and tailor the attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs. Restarting a machine in safe mode (T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot) is a common method to evade detection, and collecting system information (T1082-System Information Discovery) is a necessary step to understand the environment.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the techniques mentioned. If Grandoreiro is not restarting the machine in safe mode, it would not be evading detection in a common manner, and if it is not collecting system information, it would not be able to tailor its actions effectively.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the threat actor first evades detection by restarting the machine in safe mode and then collects system information.
- The related TTPs confirm that both of these actions are common and effective techniques used by threat actors.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes both evading detection and collecting system information.

**Final Answer: A**
