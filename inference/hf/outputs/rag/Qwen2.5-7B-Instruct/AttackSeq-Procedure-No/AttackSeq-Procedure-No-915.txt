Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for Persistence.
2. Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system for Lateral Movement.
3. Employing modified registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office during Defense Evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.001-Office Template Macros**
  - This technique involves using macros in Office templates to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious templates into Office documents to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (T1137.001-Office Template Macros):**
  - This technique is used to ensure the malware remains active on the system.
- **Lateral Movement:**
  - The question mentions injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement. This is a plausible step after persistence has been established.
- **Defense Evasion (T1221-Template Injection):**
  - This technique is used to evade detection by modifying templates and injecting malicious content.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Persistence (T1137.001-Office Template Macros):**
   - Gamaredon is known to use Office templates with macros for persistence.
2. **Lateral Movement:**
   - After establishing persistence, the next logical step is to spread the malware to other systems within the network. Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents is a common method for lateral movement.
3. **Defense Evasion (T1221-Template Injection):**
   - To ensure the malware remains undetected, Gamaredon might use techniques like modifying registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the techniques and tactics used by Gamaredon. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: Yes
