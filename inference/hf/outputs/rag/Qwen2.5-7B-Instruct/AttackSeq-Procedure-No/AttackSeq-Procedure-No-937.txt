Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Darkhotel APT:
1. Gaining initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
2. Compromising trusted commercial network resources.
3. Performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves making malicious activity appear legitimate by matching names or locations to trusted entities.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to the network.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.002-Business Relationships**: This technique involves gathering information about business relationships to better understand the target environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions gaining initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This aligns with the technique T1078-Valid Accounts, where the malware is used to gain access.
- **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: The question suggests that the APT will compromise trusted commercial network resources. This step is not directly covered by the provided TTPs, but it is a plausible follow-up to gaining initial access.
- **Reconnaissance**: The question states that the APT will perform reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans. This aligns with the technique T1591.002-Business Relationships, which involves gathering information about business relationships.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The malware disguised as legitimate software updates is a method of gaining initial access, which aligns with T1078-Valid Accounts.
2. **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: While not explicitly covered by the provided TTPs, it is a logical step after gaining initial access to establish a foothold.
3. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering detailed knowledge of victims' whereabouts and travel plans aligns with T1591.002-Business Relationships.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the APT will indeed perform these actions.

### Final Answer: A
