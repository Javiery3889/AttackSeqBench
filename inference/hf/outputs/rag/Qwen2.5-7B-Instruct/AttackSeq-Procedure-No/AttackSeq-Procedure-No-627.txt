Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor.
   - It mentions that the backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This TTP is relevant as it describes the method used by the backdoor to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This TTP is also relevant as it specifies the use of DNS for protocol tunneling.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This TTP is directly related to the question, as it describes the technique of discovering processes on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - The related TTPs do not directly mention process discovery or system information discovery, but they do provide context about the communication methods used by the backdoor.
   - The TTP T1057-Process Discovery is specifically about discovering processes, which aligns with the question's focus on process discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor used protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a C2 channel, which is a Command and Control tactic.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of process discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - The related TTP T1057-Process Discovery is directly relevant to the question.
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention process discovery, the context of the question and the related TTPs suggest that the backdoor could perform process discovery as part of its operations.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the backdoor likely performed process discovery as part of its operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the answer choice that indicates the backdoor performed process discovery.

Final Answer: A: Yes
