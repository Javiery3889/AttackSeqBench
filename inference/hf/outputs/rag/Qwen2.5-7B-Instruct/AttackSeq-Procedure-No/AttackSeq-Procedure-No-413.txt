Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP.
2. Downloading PUPYRAT using stolen credentials.
3. Using tools like ProxyChains.
4. Leveraging reconnaissance tools within custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation during the Discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to maintain or enhance access.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This is directly related to the initial lateral movement via RDP.
- **Technique T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This is related to the subsequent actions of downloading and using tools like PUPYRAT.

The question asks if the sequence of actions described is plausible. Let's break it down:
1. **RDP (T1021.001)**: This is the initial lateral movement.
2. **Download PUPYRAT (T1570)**: This is a subsequent action after gaining access.
3. **Using ProxyChains**: This is a tool that might be used for network traffic manipulation, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase.
4. **Reconnaissance tools in custom VMs**: This is part of the Discovery phase, which typically comes after gaining access and before or during the exploitation phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The initial lateral movement via RDP (T1021.001) is followed by the download of PUPYRAT (T1570) using stolen credentials.
- The use of ProxyChains and reconnaissance tools in custom VMs are actions that can occur during the Discovery phase, which is a plausible sequence of events.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
