Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Communication with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.
2. Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
3. Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves modifying the file-time of a dropped file to match that of a legitimate file, which is directly related to the second step in the question.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves using registry permissions to persist malware, which is not directly related to the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a legitimate process, which is directly related to the third step in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions:
    1. Communication with C&C servers (not directly related to the TTPs but part of the overall attack).
    2. Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL (matches T1036.005).
    3. Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process (matches T1055.001).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions, as it would imply that the malware does not perform the steps described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that includes modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL and loading it into a legitimate process to evade detection.
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions are part of the malware's behavior.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
