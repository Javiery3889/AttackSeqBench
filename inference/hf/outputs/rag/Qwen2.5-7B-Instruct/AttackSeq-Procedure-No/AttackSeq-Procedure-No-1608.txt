### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy (a hypothetical adversary) is likely to gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access to victim systems before targeting Kavach, a multi-factor authentication (MFA) app used by the Government of India.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique involves stealing private keys, which are often used for encryption and decryption.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves compromising MFA mechanisms, which is relevant to the question since Kavach is an MFA app.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique involves intercepting MFA tokens or credentials, which is also relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy would gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access. Given the related TTPs, this is plausible because:
       - Stealing private keys (T1552.004) is a common method for gaining access to systems.
       - Compromising MFA (T1556.006) and intercepting MFA tokens (T1111) are also relevant techniques that could be used to bypass MFA and gain access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy would not gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access. However, this is less plausible because:
       - The related TTPs indicate that stealing private keys and compromising MFA are relevant techniques, which suggests that gathering encryption keys could be part of the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the plausibility of the techniques involved, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that SideCopy would gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access to victim systems.

**Final Answer: A**
