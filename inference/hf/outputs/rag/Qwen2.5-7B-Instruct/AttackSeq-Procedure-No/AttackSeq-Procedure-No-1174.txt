### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, the dropping of Taidoor malware, and the opening of a decoy document for initial access.
   - The question then asks whether Taidoor is likely to perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to run malicious code on the victim's system. This aligns with the initial exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 and the dropping of Taidoor malware.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. This is relevant to the question as it pertains to anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Taidoor will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.
     - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, it is plausible that Taidoor would implement such checks to avoid detection by security tools and sandbox environments.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Taidoor will not perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.
     - This is less plausible given the related TTPs, as the presence of T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion techniques indicates a need for such checks to evade detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
