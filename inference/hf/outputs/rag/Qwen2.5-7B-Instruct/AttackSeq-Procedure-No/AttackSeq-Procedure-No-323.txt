Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the Command and Control (C2) server.
2. Collecting information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using standard encoding methods to obfuscate data. The Base64 encoding mentioned in the question aligns with this technique.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as system configuration, installed software, and network topology.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed collect the specified information (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) during the Discovery phase.
  - The related TTPs (T1082 and T1083) support the idea of gathering system and file information, which is consistent with the Discovery phase.
  - The Base64 encoding technique (T1132.001) is used for communication with the C2 server, which is a Command and Control activity, but it does not directly impact the information gathering during the Discovery phase.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not collect the specified information during the Discovery phase.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that information gathering is a key part of the Discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Base64 encoding technique (T1132.001) is used for communication with the C2 server, which is a Command and Control activity.
- The related TTPs for Discovery (T1082 and T1083) indicate that the malware will gather system and file information, which is consistent with the Discovery phase.
- The question specifically asks about the collection of text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, which are forms of information that would be gathered during the Discovery phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
