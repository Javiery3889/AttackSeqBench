Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deploying `tcpdump` to scrape credential-containing files.
2. Using `Infamous Chisel` to exfiltrate the collected files.
3. Enumerating system data directories and GPS information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the use of `Infamous Chisel` to exfiltrate the collected files.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the enumeration of system data directories, which aligns with the step of enumerating system data directories.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that `Infamous Chisel` will automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services before enumerating system data directories and GPS information.
  - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs, as it involves both exfiltration (using T1020) and discovery (using T1083).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that `Infamous Chisel` will not automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services before enumerating system data directories and GPS information.
  - This sequence does not align with the related TTPs, as it skips the exfiltration step before the discovery step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where `Infamous Chisel` is used for exfiltration after scraping credential-containing files, and then the system data directories are enumerated.
- The related TTPs confirm that `Infamous Chisel` is used for automated exfiltration (T1020) and that file and directory discovery (T1083) is a subsequent step.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes both exfiltration and discovery in the described order.

**Final Answer: A**
