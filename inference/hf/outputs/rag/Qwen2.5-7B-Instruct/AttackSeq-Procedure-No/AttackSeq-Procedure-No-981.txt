Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering credentials using tools like ChromePass and Lazagne.
2. The question then asks if Buckeye (presumably a threat actor) is likely to focus on file and print servers to steal documents only after gathering credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used for credential access:
- **T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials**: This technique involves using cached credentials to gain access to systems.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.
- **T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves extracting credentials from files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Credentials**: The question mentions using tools like ChromePass and Lazagne, which aligns with T1003-OS Credential Dumping and T1552.001-Credentials In Files.
- **Focus on File and Print Servers**: The question asks if the threat actor (Buckeye) is likely to focus on file and print servers to steal documents only after gathering credentials.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Credential Access**: The threat actor has already gathered credentials using tools like ChromePass and Lazagne, which are techniques for OS credential dumping and credentials in files.
2. **Focus on File and Print Servers**: After gathering credentials, the next logical step would be to use these credentials to access file and print servers to steal documents. This aligns with the TTPs related to credential access and the subsequent use of these credentials to access specific types of servers.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after gathering credentials, the threat actor would indeed focus on file and print servers to steal documents. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
