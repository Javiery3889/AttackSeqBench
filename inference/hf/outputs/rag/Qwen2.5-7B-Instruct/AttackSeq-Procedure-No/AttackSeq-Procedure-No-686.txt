### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already established contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over protocols other than the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1048 and T1048.003, which involve exfiltrating data over alternative and unencrypted protocols.
     - FTP and SMTP are common unencrypted protocols that could be used for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it suggests that attackers would not use FTP or SMTP for exfiltration, which contradicts the techniques described.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that attackers are likely to use FTP or SMTP for exfiltration, as these protocols are mentioned in the related TTPs.

Final Answer: A
