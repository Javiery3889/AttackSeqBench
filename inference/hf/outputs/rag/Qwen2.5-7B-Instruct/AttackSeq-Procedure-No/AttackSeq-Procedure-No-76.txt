Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the malware has already gathered information about the infected computer, including system and user names. The next step in the sequence is to extract emails from archived Outlook .pst files and transmit the data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.003-Email Account**: This technique involves the attacker discovering email accounts, which is a preparatory step for accessing email content.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves the attacker collecting email content from the local system, which aligns with the step of extracting emails from .pst files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the techniques T1114.001-Local Email Collection, which involves extracting emails from local storage (such as .pst files).
  - The question also mentions transmitting the data through encrypted emails, which is a plausible next step after collecting the emails.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the techniques provided, as it does not involve the extraction or collection of emails from local storage.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already gathered system and user information, which is a preparatory step.
- The next logical step is to collect emails from the local system, specifically from archived .pst files, which is covered by the T1114.001-Local Email Collection technique.
- After collecting the emails, the malware would likely transmit the data through encrypted emails to the attackers, which is a common exfiltration technique.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
