Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the actor "FamousSparrow":
1. Utilizing "SparrowDoor" to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS.
2. Performing encrypted communications using multi-byte XOR keys.
3. Exfiltrating data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the exfiltration and communication methods:
- **T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves exfiltrating data at a scheduled time or interval.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's description of exfiltrating data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.
  - It also aligns with the use of a C2 channel (as described by T1041) for exfiltration.
  - The use of HTTPS for communication (as described by T1029) is also consistent with the question.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the question's description of the exfiltration method and timing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions involving communication, encryption, and exfiltration.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of a C2 channel (T1041) and scheduled transfer (T1029) for exfiltration.
- Answer Choice A is consistent with the described sequence and the related TTPs.
- Answer Choice B contradicts the described sequence.

### Final Answer: Yes
