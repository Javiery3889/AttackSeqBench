Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - APT42 conducts reconnaissance to identify targets through spear-phishing and surveillance operations.
   - After reconnaissance, they use valid account information to remotely access victim networks.
   - They then perform credential harvesting through social engineering efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using spear-phishing to gather information, which also fits the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which again aligns with the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT42 first conducts reconnaissance, then uses valid account information to remotely access networks, and finally performs credential harvesting.
   - The related TTPs (T1589, T1598.001, and T1598) all pertain to gathering information through various means, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that after reconnaissance, APT42 will use valid account information to remotely access victim networks before performing credential harvesting. This sequence is plausible and aligns with the TTPs provided.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The reconnaissance phase (T1589, T1598.001, T1598) involves gathering information.
   - Using valid account information to remotely access networks is a logical next step after gathering reconnaissance information.
   - Credential harvesting through social engineering is a subsequent step that can be performed after gaining access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after reconnaissance, APT42 will use valid account information to remotely access victim networks before performing credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: A**
