Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Leveraging PowerShell to run malware directly in memory.
2. Changing the default program association in the registry to open HWP documents.
3. Using a modified PowerShell profile to run a script for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing the default program association in the registry to open specific file types.
- **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying the PowerShell profile to execute scripts or commands when PowerShell starts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This TTP is directly related to changing the default program association in the registry to open HWP documents.
- **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This TTP is related to using a modified PowerShell profile for persistence.

Given the sequence described in the question, the group would likely follow these steps:
1. Change the default program association in the registry to open HWP documents.
2. Use a modified PowerShell profile to run a script for persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it is likely that the group will change the default program association in the registry to open HWP documents before using a modified PowerShell profile to run a script for persistence.
- The related TTPs confirm that both of these actions are part of the T1546 technique, specifically T1546.001 for changing the default file association and T1546.013 for using a modified PowerShell profile.
- The sequence described in the question aligns perfectly with the TTPs provided.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
