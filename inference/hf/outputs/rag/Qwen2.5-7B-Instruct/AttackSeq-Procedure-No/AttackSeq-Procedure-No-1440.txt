Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Credential hopping
2. Configuring malware for WMI persistence
3. Generating repeated MFA requests
4. Using web session cookies for credential access
5. Accessing cloud resources

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**: This technique involves using web session cookies to maintain access to web-based resources.
- **T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**: This technique involves generating repeated MFA requests to bypass or weaken MFA protections.
- **T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**: This technique is mentioned again, reinforcing the use of web session cookies.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the generation of repeated MFA requests (T1621) and the use of web session cookies (T1550.004) for credential access.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the campaign does not use MFA requests and web session cookies, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes generating repeated MFA requests and using web session cookies for credential access.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of T1621 for MFA request generation and T1550.004 for web session cookies.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the only option that aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
