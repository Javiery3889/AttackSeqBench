Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a skip-2.0 backdoor exploits a DLL hijacking vulnerability to install itself in a system directory and load via a Windows service.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will use hooks in the sqllang.dll service for stealth and block event logging to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the DLL search order to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique is used to ensure the malware remains persistent on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question already mentions that the backdoor uses DLL hijacking to ensure persistence. This aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The question asks if the backdoor will use hooks in the sqllang.dll service for stealth and block event logging.
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention hooks in sqllang.dll, the tactic of Defense Evasion (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking) can be used for various purposes, including stealth and evading detection.
   - Blocking event logging (T1574.002) is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection by security systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor is already using DLL hijacking for persistence, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
   - Hooks in sqllang.dll could be a method to further evade detection by monitoring system activities.
   - Blocking event logging is a direct way to evade defenses and is a common tactic in malware operations.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the backdoor would use hooks in sqllang.dll for stealth and block event logging to evade defenses.

Final Answer: A: Yes
