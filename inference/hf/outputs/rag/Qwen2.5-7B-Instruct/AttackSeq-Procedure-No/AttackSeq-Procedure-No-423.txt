Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. It then asks if an encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the use of a malicious file to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands or scripts.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of VBS (Visual Basic Script) to execute commands or scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions phishing emails containing a malicious Word document, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
- **Encoded PowerShell Script**: The question states that an encoded PowerShell script will execute. This aligns with T1059.001-PowerShell.
- **VBS Macro**: The question mentions that the PowerShell script will be retrieved via a VBS macro. This aligns with T1059.005-Visual Basic.
- **Download Payloads**: The question states that the VBS macro will download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Phishing emails containing a malicious Word document (T1204.002-Malicious File).
2. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: The encoded PowerShell script will execute (T1059.001-PowerShell).
3. **Retrieval via VBS Macro**: The PowerShell script will be retrieved via a VBS macro (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
4. **Download of Malware Payloads**: The VBS macro will download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Given the sequence described in the question and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
