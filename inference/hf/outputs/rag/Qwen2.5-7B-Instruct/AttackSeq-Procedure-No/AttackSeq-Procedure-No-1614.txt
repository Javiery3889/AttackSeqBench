Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.
2. Determining whether the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email accounts from local email clients or servers.
- **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to route emails to a different destination.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This TTP directly relates to the first part of the question, where email accounts are collected from Microsoft Outlook MAPI.
- **T1114.0.03-Email Forwarding Rule**: This TTP is more about redirecting emails rather than exfiltrating them over FTP.

The question asks about the automatic exfiltration of collected email accounts over FTP. While T1114.001 is relevant to the collection part, T1114.003 is not directly related to exfiltration over FTP.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the exfiltration of collected email accounts over FTP.
- The related TTPs do not directly mention FTP exfiltration.
- The question does not provide any additional context that would suggest FTP exfiltration is part of the attack sequence.

Given the options:
- **A: Yes** - There is no evidence in the related TTPs to support this.
- **B: No** - This is the more plausible answer based on the information provided.

### Final Answer: B
