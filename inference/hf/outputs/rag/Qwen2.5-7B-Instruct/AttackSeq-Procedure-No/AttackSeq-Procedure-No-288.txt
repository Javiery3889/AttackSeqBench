Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Scanning for vulnerable websites (likely for initial access).
2. Sending spear-phishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files.
3. Deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain access to a system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique specifically involves spear-phishing with links.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using malicious links to execute code or download malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious links as a method to gain initial access, followed by the deployment of malware tools.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the sequence of TTPs does not include the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious links.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the first step is scanning for vulnerable websites, which is a form of initial access.
- The next step is sending spear-phishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files, which is a specific form of initial access.
- Finally, the malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill are deployed for execution, which is a form of execution.
- The related TTPs confirm that spear-phishing with links (T1566.002) is a valid technique for initial access, and the use of malicious links (T1204.001) is a valid technique for execution.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is supported by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
