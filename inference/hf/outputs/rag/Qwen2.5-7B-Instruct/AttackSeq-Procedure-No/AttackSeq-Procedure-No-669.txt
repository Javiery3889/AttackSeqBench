Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase.
2. The question then asks if it is likely that they would then use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to gather information about the target network.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding infrastructure to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique involves discovering and exploiting containers and resources.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after identifying domains resolving to the same IP address, the adversaries would use DOCKERGEDDON to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase.
  - DOCKERGEDDON is a tool that can be used to scan for Docker APIs, which aligns with the T1613-Container and Resource Discovery technique.
  - Scanning entire netblocks (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks) is a common practice during the Reconnaissance phase to gather information about the target network.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the adversaries would not use DOCKERGEDDON to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase.
  - This does not align with the techniques and tactics described in the related TTPs, as scanning IP blocks and discovering containers are common activities during the Reconnaissance phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that aligns with the Reconnaissance phase, where adversaries would gather information about the target network.
- The related TTPs mention scanning IP blocks (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks) and discovering containers (T1613-Container and Resource Discovery), which are consistent with the actions described in the question.
- DOCKERGEDDON is a tool that can be used to discover and exploit Docker APIs, which fits the T1613-Container and Resource Discovery technique.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
