Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Delivery of KerrDown via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.
2. Creation of system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software.
3. Use of base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002)**: This technique is used to load a malicious DLL into a process, which is consistent with the delivery of KerrDown via RAR archives or Office documents.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves creating system services to ensure the malware remains active on the system, which aligns with the second step in the question.
- **Base64 Encoding**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, base64 encoding is a common method to obfuscate and execute payloads, which can be part of the overall attack sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Delivery via Malicious Documents**: KerrDown is delivered via malicious Office documents or RAR archives, which can enable DLL side-loading.
2. **Creating System Services**: After delivery, the malware likely creates system services to ensure persistence and maintain control over the infected system.
3. **Base64 Encoding**: The use of base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture is a plausible method to ensure the payload is correctly executed.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
