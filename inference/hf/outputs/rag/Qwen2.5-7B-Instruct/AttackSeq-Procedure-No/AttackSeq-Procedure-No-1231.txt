Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Lazarus group:
1. Deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
2. Disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.
3. Using backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**: This technique involves actions that prevent the system from recovering from an attack, such as deleting backup files and Volume Shadow Copies.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate the answer choices based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, the Lazarus group would likely use backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands to further disrupt operations and maintain control.
  - The related TTPs (T1070.004-File Deletion and T1490-Inhibit System Recovery) support the actions taken by the Lazarus group to delete files and prevent system recovery, which are consistent with the sequence described.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the Lazarus group did not use backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands after deploying the ransomware, it would contradict the described sequence of actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the Lazarus group first deploys ransomware to delete critical files, then uses backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands.
- The related TTPs (T1070.004-File Deletion and T1490-Inhibit System Recovery) support the actions taken by the Lazarus group to delete files and prevent system recovery.
- Answer Choice A aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs, while Answer Choice B does not.

### Final Answer: Yes
