Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deployment of DarkComet for credential dumping.
2. Credential access using LSASS memory.
3. Data exfiltration using FastUploader.
4. Communication with compromised systems using web services like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing credentials stored in the LSASS memory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- **DarkComet for credential dumping**: This is a valid initial step.
- **Credential access using LSASS memory**: This is a valid follow-up step.
- **Data exfiltration using FastUploader**: This is a plausible step, as FastUploader is a known tool for data exfiltration.
- **Communication with compromised systems using web services like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT**: This is a valid final step, as these are known C2 communication channels.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This choice would imply that the sequence described in the question is not plausible. However, the sequence described aligns well with the related TTPs and is a common sequence in cyber attacks.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the related TTPs.
- DarkComet is used for credential dumping, which is followed by accessing credentials stored in LSASS memory.
- Data exfiltration using FastUploader is a plausible step, as it is a known tool for data exfiltration.
- Communication with compromised systems using web services like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT is a valid final step, as these are known C2 communication channels.

### Final Answer: Yes
