Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. BlackSoul gathers browser data, including usernames and passwords.
2. It then encrypts C2 traffic using a copy of the OpenSSL library.
3. It communicates with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON-based data encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using standard encoding methods for data transmission.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique is relevant to the use of RESTful Strapi protocol, which is a web protocol.
- **Technique T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique is relevant to the use of JSON-based data encoding, which is a standard encoding method.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The question asks if BlackSoul is likely to encrypt C2 traffic using a copy of the OpenSSL library. This is a specific method of encryption.
- The question also mentions using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding, which are standard methods for web communication and data transmission.

Given the related TTPs, the question is asking about a specific sequence of actions that include encryption and the use of standard web protocols and encoding. The related TTPs do not directly address the encryption method, but they do support the use of web protocols and standard encoding.

### Final Answer
Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlackSoul is likely to use standard methods for C2 communication, including web protocols and standard encoding, but the specific method of encryption (using OpenSSL) is not directly supported by the related TTPs.

However, the question is asking if it is "likely" to encrypt C2 traffic using OpenSSL, and given that this is a common method of encryption, it is reasonable to assume that it could be used.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
