Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. **Exfiltration**: Using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
2. **Credential Access**: Targeting access credentials from Indian government employees.
3. **Use of njRAT**: Only after the exfiltration step.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration)**: This aligns with the exfiltration step.
- **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials)**: This aligns with the reconnaissance phase, which is not directly mentioned in the question but is relevant.
- **Credential Access (T1552.001-Credentials In Files)**: This aligns with the credential access step.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- **Exfiltration**: The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases is a plausible exfiltration technique.
- **Credential Access**: Targeting access credentials from Indian government employees is a plausible credential access technique.
- **Use of njRAT**: The question states that njRAT is used only after the exfiltration step, which is a plausible sequence.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This would imply that the sequence described in the question is not plausible, which would mean that the exfiltration, credential access, and use of njRAT do not align in the described order or manner.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs that aligns with the related TTPs.
- The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltration is a plausible technique.
- Targeting credentials from Indian government employees is a plausible credential access technique.
- The use of njRAT after exfiltration is a plausible sequence, as it suggests a method to maintain persistence or further access after the initial exfiltration.

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the related TTPs and the plausibility of the techniques and tactics involved, the most plausible sequence is described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
