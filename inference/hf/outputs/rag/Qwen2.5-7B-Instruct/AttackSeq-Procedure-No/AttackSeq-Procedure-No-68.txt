Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a CCleaner binary, which has been downloaded as part of a compromised installation package signed with a valid digital certificate, is likely to leverage the Microsoft Graph API to perform actions across Azure and M365 environments.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique involves the use of APIs to execute commands or actions in cloud environments.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves the use of cloud accounts to maintain access to cloud resources.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique involves the use of valid digital certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique is directly related to the use of the Microsoft Graph API to perform actions in cloud environments, which aligns with the question.
- **Technique T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique is about maintaining access through cloud accounts, which is a step that could be part of the overall attack but is not directly related to the use of the Microsoft Graph API.
- **Technique T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique is about using a valid digital certificate to sign the malicious binary, which is a method to evade detection but does not directly relate to the use of the Microsoft Graph API.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions the use of the Microsoft Graph API to perform actions across Azure and M365 environments.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1059.009-Cloud API, directly support the use of the Microsoft Graph API.
- The other TTPs (T1078.004-Cloud Accounts and T1553.002-Code Signing) are supportive but not directly related to the use of the Microsoft Graph API.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the use of the Microsoft Graph API (T1059.009-Cloud API).

### Final Answer: A
