Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Earth Lusca engaged in the following sequence of actions:
1. Lateral movement
2. Exploiting remote services
3. Using internal spear phishing
4. Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network services, which also aligns with using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exploiting Remote Services (T1210)**: This is a technique for lateral movement, which is the first step in the sequence.
- **Internal Spear Phishing**: This is not listed as a related TTP, and it is not a standard technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Spear phishing is more commonly associated with initial access rather than lateral movement.
- **Using Tools for Discovery (T1018 and T1046)**: These techniques are used to discover machines and services in the network, which is a step that typically follows exploitation and initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)**: This is a plausible first step in the sequence, as it aligns with the tactic of lateral movement.
2. **Internal Spear Phishing**: This is not a standard technique for lateral movement and is not listed as a related TTP. It is more likely to be an initial access technique.
3. **Using Tools for Discovery (T1018 and T1046)**: These techniques are used to discover machines and services in the network, which is a logical next step after exploiting remote services.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)
- Using Tools for Discovery (T1018 and T1046)

### Final Answer: No

The question's sequence includes internal spear phishing, which is not a standard technique for lateral movement and is not listed as a related TTP. Therefore, the sequence described in the question is not plausible.
