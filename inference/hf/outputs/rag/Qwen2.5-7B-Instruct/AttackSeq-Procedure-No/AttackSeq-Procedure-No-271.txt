Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda's Korplug variant uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP. It then asks if it is likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
  - This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which aligns with the custom protocol used for data exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the data discovery aspect of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to perform data discovery, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.
  - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1083-File and Directory Discovery, it is plausible that the malware would perform such actions to gather as much data as possible before exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware is unlikely to perform data discovery.
  - While it is possible that the malware might not perform data discovery, the related TTPs do not provide evidence to support this claim. The custom protocol for data exfiltration (T1560.003) and the need to gather data (T1083) suggest that data discovery is a likely step in the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where data exfiltration is occurring, and the related TTPs indicate that data collection and discovery are common steps in such attacks.
- The custom protocol for data exfiltration (T1560.003) and the need to gather data (T1083) strongly suggest that the malware would perform data discovery to ensure it has the necessary data to exfiltrate.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware would indeed perform data discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
