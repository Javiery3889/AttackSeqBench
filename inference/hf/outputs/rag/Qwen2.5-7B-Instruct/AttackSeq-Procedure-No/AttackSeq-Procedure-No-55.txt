Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Lazarus achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory only after gaining initial access to the victim's network through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This involves two key points:
1. Initial access to the network via spear-phishing.
2. Execution of the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain access to a network.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This is a specific type of spear-phishing where the attacker uses a malicious attachment (like a Word document) to gain access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This aligns with the TTPs related to initial access via spear-phishing.
- **Execution of ThreatNeedle**: The question asks if the ThreatNeedle backdoor was executed in memory. This is a plausible step after gaining initial access, as the backdoor would need to be executed to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This is consistent with the TTPs related to initial access via spear-phishing.
2. **Execution of ThreatNeedle**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to execute the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory. This is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors to maintain stealth and persistence.

Given the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Lazarus achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.

### Final Answer: A
