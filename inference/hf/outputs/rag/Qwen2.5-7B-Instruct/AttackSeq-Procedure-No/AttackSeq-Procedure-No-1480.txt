Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by a malware (Seaduke) that includes:
     - Retrieving detailed bot/system information.
     - Securely deleting itself using a 'seppuku' function.
     - Calculating the command-and-control (C2) port using a specific formula: multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system. This aligns with the first step of the question where Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.003-DNS Calculation:**
     - This technique involves calculating a domain name or IP address for C2 communication. While this is related to C2, it does not directly match the specific calculation described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses for C2 communication. This is also related to C2 but does not directly match the specific calculation described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about a calculation method for the C2 port, which is not directly covered by the related TTPs. However, the related TTPs suggest that the malware is involved in both discovery and C2 activities.
   - The calculation method described in the question (multiplying the first two octets and adding the third octet) is a specific and unique method that does not align with the standard techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a specific and unique method for calculating the C2 port, which is not directly covered by the related TTPs.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware is involved in discovery and C2 activities but do not provide a basis for the specific calculation method described.
   - Given the unique nature of the calculation method and the lack of direct alignment with the related TTPs, it is unlikely that Seaduke would use this specific method.

**Final Answer: B: No**
