Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
2. Delivery of DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
3. The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would clear Linux or Mac system logs before utilizing DanBot for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This technique is used to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves delivering malware via a file.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions password spraying or brute-force attacks, which aligns with the T1110.003-Password Spraying technique.
- **Delivery of Malware**: The question mentions delivering DanBot via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments, which aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
- **Execution of Commands**: The question asks about executing arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`. This is a technique related to execution, but `cmd.exe` is typically associated with Windows systems, not Linux or Mac systems.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Clearing Logs**: The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would clear Linux or Mac system logs. This is a technique related to defense evasion (T1112.003-Remove or Clear Logs), but it is not directly mentioned in the provided TTPs.
- **Execution via `cmd.exe`**: Since `cmd.exe` is typically used on Windows systems, and the question mentions Linux or Mac systems, it is unlikely that `cmd.exe` would be used for execution on these systems.

Given the context and the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence does not include clearing logs on Linux or Mac systems before executing commands via `cmd.exe`.

### Final Answer: B: No
