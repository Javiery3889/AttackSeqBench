Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
1. Spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access.
2. Delivery of exploit documents.
3. Installation and execution of a VBA script (vba_macro.exe).
4. Dropping malware (FONTCACHE.DAT).
5. Leveraging tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection. While this is a valid technique, it does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code. This is directly related to the installation and execution of a VBA script (vba_macro.exe).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. APT28 uses spear-phishing to gain initial access, then uses a VBA script to drop malware, and finally leverages other tools.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that APT28 does not use the described sequence of actions, which contradicts the information provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions that APT28 is known to use.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1059.005-Visual Basic, directly support the use of a VBA script as part of the attack sequence.
- The sequence of actions (spear-phishing, VBA script, malware drop, and tool usage) is consistent with APT28's known tactics.

### Final Answer: Yes
