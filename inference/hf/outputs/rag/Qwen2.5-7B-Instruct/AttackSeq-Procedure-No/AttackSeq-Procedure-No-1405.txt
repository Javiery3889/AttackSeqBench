Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. WMI for lateral movement.
2. Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.
3. Leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts.
4. Internal reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence. However, it does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process, which aligns with the question's mention of gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After gaining credentials via LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing, FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that FIN13 does not use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance after gaining credentials, which contradicts the question's description.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement, gains credentials via LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing, and then uses native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1003.001-LSASS Memory, confirm the method of credential access.
- The sequence described in the question is consistent with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like FIN13, who often use a combination of techniques to maintain persistence and gather information.

### Final Answer: Yes
