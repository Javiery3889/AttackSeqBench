Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence:
1. Initial access through opportunistic phishing emails.
2. Creation of backdoors on compromised systems.
3. Use of AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser.
4. Execution of malicious payloads, including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing emails to gain initial access to a system.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code in a browser.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attackers used opportunistic phishing emails, which aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique.
- **Execution**: The question then mentions the use of AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser, which aligns with the T1059.007-JavaScript technique.
- **Payload Execution**: The question states that the attackers executed malicious payloads, including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool. However, the related TTPs do not directly mention the installation of specific tools. The T1059.007-JavaScript technique is more about executing code, not necessarily installing specific tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question (phishing, backdoors, AppleScript, and JavaScript injection) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
- However, the specific mention of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool installation is not directly supported by the provided TTPs. The T1059.007-JavaScript technique is more about executing code rather than installing specific tools.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question, but the specific tool installation is not directly supported by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes

The question's sequence of TTPs is plausible based on the provided related TTPs, even though the specific tool installation is not directly supported.
