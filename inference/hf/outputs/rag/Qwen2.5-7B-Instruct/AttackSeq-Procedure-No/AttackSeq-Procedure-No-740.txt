Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Elderwood Project attackers:
1. Deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.
2. Breaching Managed Service Providers (MSPs).
3. Delivering malware to MSP customers.
4. Maintaining control over compromised systems and retrieving commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain initial access.
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a malicious website or other publicly accessible content.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions "deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks." This aligns with the TTPs provided, as watering hole attacks can be considered a form of drive-by compromise.
- **Breach of MSPs**: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will breach Managed Service Providers (MSPs). This step is not directly covered by the provided TTPs, but it is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
- **Delivery of Malware**: The question mentions delivering malware to MSP customers. This is a common follow-up step after gaining access to an organization.
- **Maintaining Control and Retrieving Commands**: The question asks about maintaining control and retrieving commands, which is a typical goal of advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks, which aligns with T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
2. **Breach of MSPs**: After gaining initial access, it is plausible that the attackers would target MSPs to gain broader access and control.
3. **Delivery of Malware**: Once in the MSP environment, delivering malware to customers is a logical next step.
4. **Maintaining Control and Retrieving Commands**: The attackers would likely maintain control and retrieve commands to ensure they can continue to operate within the compromised systems.

Given the sequence of actions and the logical progression, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed likely to include breaching MSPs to deliver malware and maintain control.

### Final Answer: A
