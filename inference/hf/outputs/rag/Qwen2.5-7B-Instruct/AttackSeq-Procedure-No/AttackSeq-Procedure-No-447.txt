Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware as part of its data destruction activities before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers. The sequence of TTPs in question is:
1. 'Apostle' wiper (initially failed execution)
2. 'DEADWOOD' malware (overwriting files)
3. 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands from C2 servers

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the destruction of data, which aligns with the question's context of data destruction activities.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files, which is a form of data destruction.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **'Apostle' Wiper**: This is a wiper that is designed to destroy data. The fact that it initially failed execution does not negate its purpose or the likelihood of its deployment as part of data destruction activities.
- **'DEADWOOD' Malware**: This malware is specifically mentioned as overwriting files, which is a direct form of data destruction.
- **'IPsec Helper'**: This is a component that awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files. This is a post-exploitation activity and does not directly relate to the initial data destruction phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are both techniques used for data destruction, which aligns with the Tactic: Impact and T1485-Data Destruction.
- The sequence of deploying these wipers before the 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands from C2 servers is plausible because the initial data destruction phase would occur before any post-exploitation activities.
- The 'IPsec Helper' is a post-exploitation component and does not fit into the initial data destruction phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Agrius would deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware as part of its data destruction activities before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

### Final Answer: A
