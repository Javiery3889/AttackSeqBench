Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using a zero-day exploit in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
2. Abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
3. Performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with the malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1528-Steal Application Access Token**: This technique involves stealing access tokens, which aligns with the question's mention of abusing OAuth access tokens.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by download, which aligns with the use of a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email content from the local system, which aligns with the question's mention of performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence of actions described in the question. It involves using a zero-day exploit (Initial Access), stealing OAuth access tokens (Credential Access), and then performing system fingerprinting and email collection (Collection).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence of actions described in the question. It would imply that the malware does not use OAuth access tokens or perform email collection, which contradicts the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first infects the target using a zero-day exploit, then uses OAuth access tokens to gain access to email accounts, and finally performs system fingerprinting and discovery.
- The related TTPs support this sequence: T1189 for initial access via a zero-day exploit, T1528 for stealing OAuth access tokens, and T1114 for collecting email content.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
