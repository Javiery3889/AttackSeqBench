Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors:
1. Reconnaissance: Identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains.
2. Collection of location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
3. Execution of Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique is directly related to the initial reconnaissance phase where ProjectM actors searched for targets on open websites and domains.
- **T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique is related to the collection of location information, which is the second phase in the sequence.
- **Tactic: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the sequence of actions but might be relevant in the broader context of the actors' operations.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After conducting reconnaissance (T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains), the actors would likely collect location information (T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations) from visitors to their phishing sites before moving on to execute Trojans (Crimson and Peppy).
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the actors did not collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites, they would not have the necessary information to tailor their attacks, which is a common practice in advanced phishing campaigns.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question (reconnaissance, collection of location information, and execution of Trojans) is a logical and common approach in cyber attacks.
- The related TTPs (T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains and T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations) support this sequence.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: Yes
