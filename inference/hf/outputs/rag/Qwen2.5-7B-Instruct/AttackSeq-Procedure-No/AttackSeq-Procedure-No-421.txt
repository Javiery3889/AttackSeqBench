Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails that lead to the execution of VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document. The specific document mentioned is 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from this document only before gaining initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via email to trick the user into clicking and executing the payload.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious file (such as a document) via email to trick the user into opening and executing the payload.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question specifically mentions a phishing email containing a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
- The related TTPs mention spearphishing attachments, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- The question asks if the campaign will execute VBS macros from the document only before gaining initial access. This implies that the execution of the VBS macros is a step in the initial access process.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The campaign involves a phishing email, which is consistent with the related TTPs.
- The document 'Richard_Johnson.doc' is a spearphishing attachment, which is a common method for delivering malicious payloads.
- The execution of VBS macros from the document is a plausible method for gaining initial access, as VBS macros can be used to automate actions and potentially download or execute other malware.
- The question does not provide any information that suggests the campaign would use a different method for initial access, such as a spearphishing link.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the campaign will indeed execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document as part of the initial access process.

### Final Answer: A
