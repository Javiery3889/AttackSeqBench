Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Cosmic Banker malware:
1. Accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.
2. Targeting Mexican financial institution users.
3. Displaying text related to an alleged data update request.
4. Executing a malicious batch file.
5. Running a PowerShell script at memory level.
6. Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs.

#### Answer Choice A: Yes
- **Accessing Outlook Information**: This is a common initial step for many malware campaigns to gather information about the victim.
- **Targeting Mexican Financial Institution Users**: This is a specific targeting strategy that aligns with the question.
- **Displaying Text Related to an Alleged Data Update Request**: This is a social engineering tactic often used to trick users into executing malicious files.
- **Executing a Malicious Batch File**: This is a method to run the payload.
- **Running a PowerShell Script at Memory Level**: This is a stealthy method to execute the payload without leaving traces on the disk.
- **Enabling Persistence through Creating Shortcuts and Manipulating Scheduled Tasks**: This aligns with the related TTPs, specifically T1053.005-Scheduled Task, which is a technique for persistence.

#### Answer Choice B: No
- This choice would imply that the sequence of actions described in the question does not align with the Cosmic Banker malware's behavior. However, the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions strongly suggest that the Cosmic Banker malware would indeed follow this sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a detailed sequence of actions that aligns with the tactics and techniques commonly used by the Cosmic Banker malware.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of scheduled tasks for persistence, which is a key part of the described sequence.
- Each step in the sequence described in the question is consistent with the known behavior of the Cosmic Banker malware.

### Final Answer: Yes
