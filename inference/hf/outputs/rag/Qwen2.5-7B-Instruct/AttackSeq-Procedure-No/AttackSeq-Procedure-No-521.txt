Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The attacker achieved persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
2. The question asks if it is likely that the attack executed an embedded .hta file using `mshta.exe` after exploiting Microsoft Word documents to gain initial access via CVE-2017-0199.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access via CVE-2017-0199**: This indicates that the attacker used a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access to the system through Microsoft Word documents.
- **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)**: This suggests that the attacker used the initial access to execute malicious code on the system.
- **Persistence (T1053.005)**: The attacker then set up a scheduled task to maintain persistence, which is consistent with the described action of scheduling a task to execute a VBS file.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. The attacker first gains initial access through a vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) and then uses this access to execute malicious code (likely the .hta file) using `mshta.exe`. This is a common technique to execute malicious content in a way that is less likely to be detected by antivirus software.
- The persistence mechanism (scheduling a task to execute a VBS file) is a standard method to ensure the attacker can maintain access to the system over time.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attack did indeed use the initial access to execute the .hta file using `mshta.exe`.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
