### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Carbanak group conducted a specific sequence of TTPs to map the internal network, collect administrative credentials, and then compromise a Domain Administrator's credentials to further compromise additional endpoints.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This TTP involves poisoning network protocols to steal credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This TTP involves gathering information about the network and potentially credentials through the poisoning of network protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the Carbanak group's known tactics. The Carbanak group is known for using LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to map the network and collect credentials. Once they have administrative credentials, they can escalate their privileges and compromise additional endpoints.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the Carbanak group's known tactics. The Carbanak group has been documented to use these specific techniques to achieve their objectives.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: Yes
