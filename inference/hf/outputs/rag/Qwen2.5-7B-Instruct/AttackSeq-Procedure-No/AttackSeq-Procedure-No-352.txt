Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence:
1. Initial access through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
2. Dropping an embedded downloader file.
3. Execution of MSIL/Crimson malware.
4. Execution of native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo`.
5. Establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves the use of native Windows APIs, which aligns with the execution of `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo`.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using `rundll32.exe` to execute code, which is a common method for executing native Windows functions.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the client machine, which aligns with the initial access through weaponized RTF documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The use of native Windows functions (`GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo`) is a common tactic in post-exploitation activities to gather information about the system.
  - The execution of these functions is consistent with the TTPs related to execution and defense evasion.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the malware did not execute these functions, it would not be gathering necessary information about the system, which is a common step in establishing command and control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access through weaponized RTF documents and the subsequent dropping of an embedded downloader file are consistent with the exploitation of a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).
- The execution of MSIL/Crimson malware is a common step in the attack sequence.
- The execution of native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo` is a typical post-exploitation activity to gather information about the system.
- Establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol is a common final step in the attack sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
