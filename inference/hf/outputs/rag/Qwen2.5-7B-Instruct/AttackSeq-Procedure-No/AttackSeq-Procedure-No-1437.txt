Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery activities using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
2. Use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment.
3. Accessing data from Information Repositories only after lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of domain accounts to escalate privileges, which aligns with the use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**
  - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally through the network, which aligns with the use of RDP for lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment after accessing data from Information Repositories is a plausible sequence of TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the threat actor did not use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally, it would contradict the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the threat actor first discovers Active Directory information using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets.
- The threat actor then uses both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment.
- The final step is accessing data from Information Repositories only after the lateral movement.
- The related TTPs, T1078.002 and T1021.001, support the use of domain accounts for privilege escalation and the use of RDP for lateral movement, respectively.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs.

**Final Answer: Yes**
