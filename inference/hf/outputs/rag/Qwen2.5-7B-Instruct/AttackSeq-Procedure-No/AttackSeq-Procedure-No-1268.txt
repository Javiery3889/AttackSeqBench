Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks, the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, for discovery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying cloud services and their associated endpoints.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves identifying files and directories on a system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: This technique involves identifying cloud infrastructure components, such as EC2 instances.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks)**: This is the first step in the attack sequence.
- **Subsequent Discovery**: The question asks about the next step, which is the enumeration of AWS infrastructure, specifically EC2 instances.

Given the related TTPs, we can see that:
- **T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery** directly aligns with the question of discovering cloud infrastructure components, such as EC2 instances.
- **T1526-Cloud Service Discovery** and **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** are more general techniques that could be part of the broader discovery process but are not specifically targeted at AWS EC2 instances.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is achieved using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks.
2. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to discover the target environment, which in this case is AWS infrastructure.
3. Among the related TTPs, **T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery** is the most specific and relevant to the question of discovering AWS EC2 instances.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
