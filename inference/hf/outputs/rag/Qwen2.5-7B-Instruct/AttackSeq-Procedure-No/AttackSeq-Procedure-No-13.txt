Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victim’s trusted relationships.
2. Conducting internal reconnaissance by accessing the user’s contacts and extracting system and network information.
3. Moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This TTP involves using spear-phishing to move laterally within a network. However, the technique specifically mentions using spear-phishing to gain access to internal systems, which is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This TTP involves developing or compromising email accounts, which aligns with the question's mention of using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that APT42 would follow the sequence described in the question.
  - The sequence of actions (spear-phishing, internal reconnaissance, lateral movement) aligns with the TTPs provided.
  - The use of compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts is a plausible method for lateral movement and resource development.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that APT42 would not follow the sequence described in the question.
  - There is no clear evidence from the related TTPs that contradicts the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that aligns with the TTPs provided.
- The use of compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts is a common method for lateral movement and resource development.
- The internal reconnaissance step (accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information) is a logical follow-up to gaining access through spear-phishing.

### Final Answer: Yes
