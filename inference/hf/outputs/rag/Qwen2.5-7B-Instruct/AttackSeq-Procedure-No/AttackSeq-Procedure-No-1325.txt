Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sayad malware:
1. Exfiltrates collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
2. Captures screenshots.
3. Collects system and application details from the compromised host.

The question asks if it is likely that the malware would capture screenshots only after performing discovery by collecting system and application details.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving or compressing the collected data before exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the compromised system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique is about archiving the collected data, which is consistent with the malware exfiltrating the collected and encrypted data.
- **Technique T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is a form of data collection.

Given the sequence described in the question, the malware would likely perform the following steps:
1. Collect system and application details (T1113-Screen Capture).
2. Archive the collected data (T1560-Archive Collected Data).
3. Exfiltrate the data (after encryption).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the malware would capture screenshots only after performing discovery by collecting system and application details.
- Based on the related TTPs, the malware would first collect system and application details (T1113-Screen Capture).
- After collecting the details, the malware would archive the collected data (T1560-Archive Collected Data).
- Finally, the malware would exfiltrate the data.

Given this sequence, it is logical that the malware would capture screenshots (T1113-Screen Capture) before archiving and exfiltrating the data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
