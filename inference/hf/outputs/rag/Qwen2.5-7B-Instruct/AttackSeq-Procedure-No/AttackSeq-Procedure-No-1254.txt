Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether BlueBravo will perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information. The specific checks mentioned are identifying strings like "Virtual," "vmware," or "VirtualBox."

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1497.001-System Checks**

T1497.001-System Checks is a technique under the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information to understand the network, system, and user environment. This technique is commonly used by attackers to determine the nature of the target environment, including whether it is virtualized.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the T1497.001-System Checks technique, which involves checking for virtualized environments. Identifying strings like "Virtual," "vmware," or "VirtualBox" are common methods to detect virtualized systems.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the T1497.001-System Checks technique, as it would imply that BlueBravo does not perform these checks, which is less likely given the nature of the technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where BlueBravo first checks for virtualized environments and then gathers system information.
- The related TTPs confirm that such checks are part of the Discovery tactic and are a standard method for attackers to understand the target environment.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that BlueBravo would perform these checks as part of its attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
