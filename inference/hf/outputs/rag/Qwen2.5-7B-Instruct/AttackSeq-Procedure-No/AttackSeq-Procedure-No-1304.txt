Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Utilizing 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck' for port scanning and network discovery.
2. Using stolen cookies for accessing cloud resources.
3. Performing pass-the-hash attacks for lateral movement.
4. Establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET' for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections, which aligns with the use of 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck' for port scanning and network discovery.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using protocols to tunnel command and control traffic, which aligns with the use of 'POWSSHNET' for command and control.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network services, which also aligns with the initial port scanning and network discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Stolen Cookies for Accessing Cloud Resources**: This is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a plausible technique for lateral movement and access to cloud resources.
- **Pass-the-Hash Attacks for Lateral Movement**: This is a common technique used in lateral movement, which is also not directly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a plausible technique.
- **RDP Connections Over SSH Tunneling**: This is directly mentioned in the related TTPs under the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial actions (port scanning and network discovery) are well-aligned with the related TTPs.
2. The use of stolen cookies for accessing cloud resources is a plausible technique but not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
3. Pass-the-hash attacks for lateral movement is a common and plausible technique but not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
4. Establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling is directly mentioned in the related TTPs and is a plausible technique for command and control.

Given the alignment with the related TTPs and the plausibility of the techniques, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
