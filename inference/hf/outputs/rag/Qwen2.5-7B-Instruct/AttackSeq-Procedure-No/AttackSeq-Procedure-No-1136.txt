Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves the creation and use of social media accounts to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique is similar to the above, focusing on the use of social media accounts.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.001-Social Media:** This technique involves using social media for reconnaissance purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs all involve the use of social media for gathering information, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - However, the question asks about a subsequent step of accessing external victim-owned websites for target development.
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention accessing external websites, the techniques described (creating and using social media accounts for gathering information) are part of a broader reconnaissance and resource development strategy.
   - WINDSHIFT APT, known for its sophisticated and targeted approach, would likely continue to use various methods to gather more information about the target, including accessing external websites.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial TTPs described in the question (using fake social media personas and stealing contact lists, emails, and SMS contents) are part of a broader reconnaissance and resource development strategy.
   - WINDSHIFT APT is known for its sophisticated and targeted approach, which often involves using multiple methods to gather information.
   - Accessing external victim-owned websites for target development is a logical next step in the attack sequence, as it would provide additional information and context about the target.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
