Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec.
2. Services are stopped and Windows Defender is disabled.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact
- Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1490-Inhibit System Recovery** is a technique that involves actions to prevent the system from recovering from a ransomware attack. This includes deleting system volume shadow copies, which are backups of the system that can be used to restore the system to a previous state.
- The question is asking if the ransomware is likely to delete system volume shadow copies in the Impact phase, which aligns with the T1490-Inhibit System Recovery technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The deployment of WastedLocker using PsExec and disabling services and Windows Defender are part of the Defense Evasion phase.
- The deletion of system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands is a common tactic used in the Impact phase to prevent the system from recovering from the ransomware attack.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1490-Inhibit System Recovery, which directly corresponds to the action of deleting system volume shadow copies.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the ransomware is likely to delete system volume shadow copies in the Impact phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
