Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords (Credential Access).
2. Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement.
3. Employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for Lateral Movement:
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network.
- **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows admin shares for lateral movement.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material, such as SAML tokens, for authentication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique is broadly applicable and can be used for various forms of lateral movement, but it does not specifically mention the use of SAML tokens.
- **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique is more specific to Windows environments and does not directly mention SAML tokens.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique directly mentions the use of alternate authentication material, such as SAML tokens, which aligns with the question's description of abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where the attacker uses a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement.
2. Among the related TTPs, **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** is the most relevant as it directly mentions the use of alternate authentication material, such as SAML tokens.
3. The question then asks if the Explosive Trojan will employ a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control after the Lateral Movement. This part of the sequence is not directly addressed by the related TTPs, but it is a plausible follow-up step in an advanced persistent threat (APT) scenario.

Given the context and the specific mention of SAML tokens in the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
