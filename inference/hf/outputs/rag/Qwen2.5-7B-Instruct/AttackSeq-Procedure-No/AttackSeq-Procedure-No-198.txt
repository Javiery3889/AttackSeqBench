Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
2. Installing a modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor.
3. Mapping the network.
4. Collecting passwords.
5. Obtaining domain administrator privileges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique involves using external remote services to establish a foothold, which can include backdoors.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question starts with gaining initial access via spearphishing emails, which is covered by T1566.001.
- **Backdoor Installation**: The question then mentions installing a modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor. While T1133-External Remote Services can involve backdoors, it is not specifically about Dropbear SSH.
- **Network Mapping and Password Collection**: These actions are not directly covered by the related TTPs but are common post-exploitation activities.
- **Domain Administrator Privileges**: This is a high-level goal that might be achieved through various means, including post-exploitation activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment to gain initial access.
- The next step is to install a backdoor, which could be a modified Dropbear SSH client. While T1133-External Remote Services is a broader category, it does not specifically mention Dropbear SSH.
- The subsequent steps of network mapping and password collection are common post-exploitation activities that are not directly covered by the related TTPs.
- The final step of obtaining domain administrator privileges is a high-level goal that can be achieved through various means, including post-exploitation activities.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Initial Access)
2. A modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor (External Remote Services)
3. Network mapping and password collection (Post-exploitation activities)
4. Obtaining domain administrator privileges (High-level goal)

### Final Answer: A
