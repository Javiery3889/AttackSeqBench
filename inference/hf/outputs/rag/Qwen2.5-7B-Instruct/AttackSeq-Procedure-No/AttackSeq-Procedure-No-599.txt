Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
1. Gathering process and hard drive information using the AutoIt downloader.
2. This occurs during the Discovery phase.
3. The group then uses malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about running processes, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros, which aligns with the second part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is plausible.
  - The AutoIt downloader is used to gather process and hard drive information, which fits the T1057-Process Discovery technique.
  - The use of malicious documents with VBA macros to establish initial access fits the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.
  - The sequence of actions (Discovery -> Initial Access) is logical and aligns with the described TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is not plausible.
  - However, the related TTPs support the described sequence, making this choice less likely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The AutoIt downloader is a known tool used for gathering information, which aligns with T1057-Process Discovery.
- The use of VBA macros in malicious documents to establish initial access aligns with T1059.005-Visual Basic.
- The sequence of actions (Discovery -> Initial Access) is consistent with the described TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
