Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a backdoor is used to collect machine information and take screenshots. It then asks whether the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before performing these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Collection** - This aligns with the backdoor collecting machine information.
- **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture** - This aligns with the backdoor taking screenshots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate the answer choices based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - If the backdoor communicates with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots, it suggests a high level of security and stealth. This is a plausible scenario, especially in sophisticated attacks where the attacker wants to avoid detection.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - If the backdoor does not communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots, it implies that the communication might be unencrypted or use a less secure method. This could be less secure but is also a plausible scenario, depending on the attacker's goals and the environment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the backdoor is used for collecting machine information and taking screenshots, which aligns with the Tactic: Collection and Technique: T1113-Screen Capture.
- The question asks if the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before these actions. This implies a high level of security and stealth.
- Given the context of sophisticated cyber attacks, it is more likely that the backdoor would use an encrypted channel to communicate with the C&C server to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
