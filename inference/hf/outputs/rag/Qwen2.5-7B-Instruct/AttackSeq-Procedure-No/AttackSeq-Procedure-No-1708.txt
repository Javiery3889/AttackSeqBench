Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions that Black Energy 2 might take:
1. Mount and bind to the `/proc/` filepath.
2. Enable subsequent operation in memory.
3. Remove on-disk artifacts.
4. Evade defenses by encrypting its payload.
5. Load plugins directly onto the infected machine.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the tactics and techniques involved:
- **T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This technique involves loading malware directly into the memory of a process, which aligns with enabling subsequent operation in memory.
- **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding the payload to evade detection, which aligns with the requirement to evade defenses by encrypting its payload.
- **T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing malware in memory or other non-file-based storage, which aligns with the requirement to load plugins directly onto the infected machine.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Mount and bind to the `/proc/` filepath: This is a plausible action for a malware to gain persistence and operate in memory.
  - Enable subsequent operation in memory: T1055.009-Proc Memory directly supports this.
  - Remove on-disk artifacts: This is a common tactic to evade detection.
  - Evade defenses by encrypting its payload: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File directly supports this.
  - Load plugins directly onto the infected machine: T1027.011-Fileless Storage directly supports this.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that none of the described actions are likely, which contradicts the presence of relevant TTPs that support each step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, all the steps described in the question are supported by the related TTPs. Therefore, it is highly likely that Black Energy 2 would follow this sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A**
