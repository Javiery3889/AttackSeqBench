Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Conducting reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan.
2. Identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
3. Determining if metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems to identify potential targets.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories on a system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique aligns with the reconnaissance phase where the attacker is identifying systems and their protocols (Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces).
- **Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique directly addresses the question of whether metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved.

Given that the question is about the discovery phase and the related TTPs specifically mention file and directory discovery, it is highly likely that the attacker would retrieve metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings as part of the discovery process.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker has already conducted reconnaissance and identified specific systems and protocols.
2. The next logical step in the discovery phase is to gather more detailed information about the systems, including file and directory structures.
3. Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery directly supports this step.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will indeed be retrieved during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
