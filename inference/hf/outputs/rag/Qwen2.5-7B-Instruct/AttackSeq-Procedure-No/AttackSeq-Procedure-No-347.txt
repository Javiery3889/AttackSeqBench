### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware first gathers system information using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` and sends it to an IP address `45.124.132.127`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server only after contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery (T1007-System Service Discovery)**: This technique involves the malware discovering system services to gather information about the target environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the malware sends system information to an IP address. This aligns with the T1007 technique, where the malware is gathering and sending information about the system.
   - The question then asks about the sequence of actions involving the domain `marina-info.net` and establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server.
   - The T1071.001 technique specifically mentions using web protocols for C2 communications, which aligns with the HTTPS communication.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the malware will establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server only after contacting the domain `marina-info.net`. This sequence of actions is plausible and aligns with the techniques mentioned.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that the malware will not establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server only after contacting the domain `marina-info.net`. This does not align as well with the described sequence of actions and the techniques involved.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
