Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon uses an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments. It then asks if it is likely that the group will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email data from various sources.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email data from local systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1114-Email Collection**: This technique is directly related to collecting email data, which aligns with the question's focus on collecting mail from accessed systems and servers.
- **Technique T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique is related to lateral movement but does not directly address the collection of email data.
- **Technique T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique is also related to collecting email data from local systems, which is a specific subset of the broader collection technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the likelihood of Gamaredon collecting mail from accessed systems and servers.
- The related TTPs indicate that Gamaredon is known to use techniques for both lateral movement and email collection.
- Given that the question specifically asks about collection activities, the most relevant TTPs are those related to email collection.
- Both T1114 and T1114.001 are relevant, but T1114 is a broader technique that encompasses T1114.001.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Gamaredon is likely to attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

### Final Answer: A
