Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery of system information using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.
2. Sending the collected information to an IP address `45.124.132.127`.
3. The malware is then expected to encrypt C2 data, convert it into a hexadecimal representation, and encode it into base64 before contacting the domain `marina-info.net`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to obfuscate the data.
  - **Technique: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable or to avoid detection by security systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves standard encoding methods, which could include base64 encoding.
- **Technique T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique is broader and could include various forms of encoding, including base64 and hexadecimal encoding.

Given the sequence described in the question, the malware is expected to:
1. Encrypt C2 data (which is a form of obfuscation).
2. Convert the data into a hexadecimal representation.
3. Encode the data into base64.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question mentions that the data is to be encrypted, which is a form of obfuscation and is consistent with the TTPs.
- **Step 2**: The data is then converted into a hexadecimal representation. This is a form of encoding, which aligns with the TTPs.
- **Step 3**: The data is then encoded into base64. Base64 encoding is a standard encoding technique, which aligns with the TTPs.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
