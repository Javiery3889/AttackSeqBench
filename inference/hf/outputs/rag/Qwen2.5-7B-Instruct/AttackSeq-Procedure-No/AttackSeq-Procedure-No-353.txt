Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. A downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.
2. The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will then download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Downloader Retrieval of Encoded Malware**: This part of the sequence is not directly related to the TTPs provided, but it sets the context for the attack.
- **PowerShell Scripts**: The related TTPs mention T1059.001-PowerShell, which is a technique used for executing code or commands on the target system. This aligns with the execution phase of the attack.
- **Downloading a Windows Executable and a Decoy Document**: This part of the sequence is relevant to the execution phase, as it involves downloading and executing files on the target system.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Downloader Retrieval of Encoded Malware**: This step is not directly covered by the provided TTPs, but it is part of the overall attack sequence.
2. **PowerShell Scripts**: The use of PowerShell scripts is a common technique in the execution phase, as indicated by the related TTPs.
3. **Downloading a Windows Executable and a Decoy Document**: This step is also a common technique in the execution phase, as it involves downloading and executing files on the target system.

Given that the related TTPs specifically mention PowerShell scripts as a technique in the execution phase, and the question asks about downloading a Windows executable and a decoy document, which are also common in the execution phase, it is plausible that both actions could occur.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
