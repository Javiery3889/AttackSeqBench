Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising.
2. Users are redirected to advertising pages or compromised websites.
3. An obfuscated PowerShell script is run to fetch malware.
4. The Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell) is used to execute the fetched malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development** - This is not directly relevant to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- **Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising** - This technique involves using malicious advertisements to deliver malware. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
- **Tactic: Execution** - This is relevant as it pertains to the execution of malware.
- **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This technique involves using PowerShell, which aligns with the third part of the sequence where an obfuscated PowerShell script is run.
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This tactic is relevant as it involves gaining access to the system, which can be achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. Malvertising (T1583.008) is used to redirect users to compromised websites, which then run an obfuscated PowerShell script (T1059.001) to fetch and execute malware.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the sequence of actions does not involve malvertising or the use of PowerShell to fetch and execute malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves the use of malvertising to redirect users to compromised websites.
- These websites then run an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch and execute malware.
- The related TTPs (T1583.008, T1059.001, and T1189) all support this sequence of actions.

### Final Answer: Yes
