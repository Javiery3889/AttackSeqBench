### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the use of `DOCKERGEDDON` during the Reconnaissance phase to scan for compromised Docker APIs.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves the development and use of malware, which aligns with the development of malicious npm packages.
   - **T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves the development of capabilities, which can include the creation of malicious software.
   - **T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves the use of social media accounts, which is not directly related to the development of malicious npm packages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the techniques related to the development of malware and capabilities, which are directly relevant to the development of malicious npm packages.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the techniques provided, as there is no indication that the use of social media accounts would prevent the development of malicious npm packages.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the context provided in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that adversaries would indeed develop malicious npm packages during the Resource Development phase.

Final Answer: A
