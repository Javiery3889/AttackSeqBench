Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Attackers install persistence points on new systems.
2. They gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase.
3. They use this knowledge to achieve lateral movement by exploiting remote services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
- **Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The question mentions that attackers install persistence points on new systems. This is a common initial access technique (T1543) but is not directly related to the TTPs provided.
- **Discovery**: The question states that attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase. This aligns with the reconnaissance phase, which is part of the attack lifecycle.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question asks if attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement after the discovery phase. This directly aligns with the Tactic: Lateral Movement and the Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: Attackers install persistence points to maintain access to the system.
2. **Discovery**: They gather information about the network, systems, users, and data.
3. **Lateral Movement**: After gathering the necessary information, they use this knowledge to move laterally within the network by exploiting remote services.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that attackers will indeed use the information gathered during the discovery phase to achieve lateral movement by exploiting remote services.

### Final Answer: A
