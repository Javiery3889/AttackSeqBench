Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether WinDealer is likely to communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) before stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting the data using AES.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
  - **Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of protocols that are not typically used for the application's intended purpose, which can include non-standard ports.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This directly supports the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication, which aligns with the question's mention of UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
- **Technique T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique can also support the use of non-standard ports, as it involves using protocols in a way that is not typical for the application's intended purpose.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the likelihood of WinDealer using non-standard ports for C2 communication.
- Both T1571 and T1095 support the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
- The question does not provide any information that would suggest WinDealer would not use these ports for C2 communication.
- The sequence of actions (stealing information and then encrypting it) is not directly relevant to the choice of ports for C2 communication, but it does not contradict the use of non-standard ports.

Given the support from the related TTPs and the lack of any contradictory information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that WinDealer will indeed use non-standard ports for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
