Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where adversaries use reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager to evade defenses. After establishing connectivity, the adversaries are likely to communicate with primary C2 servers and relay victim information. The question asks whether it is likely that the adversaries will use secondary C2 servers for communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
- **Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1008-Fallback Channels** is a technique that involves using alternative communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. This technique is often used when the primary C2 channel is compromised or detected.

Given this context, it is highly plausible that adversaries would use secondary C2 servers as a fallback mechanism to ensure they can continue to communicate with their victims even if the primary C2 server is taken down or detected.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reflective Code Loading with Empire DLL Launcher**: This technique is used to evade detection by loading malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process, making it harder to detect.
2. **Establishing Connectivity**: After evading defenses, the adversaries establish a connection to their primary C2 server.
3. **Relaying Victim Information**: They then relay information about the victim to the primary C2 server.
4. **Fallback Channels (T1008)**: Given the nature of T1008, it is reasonable to assume that adversaries would use secondary C2 servers as a fallback in case the primary C2 server is compromised or taken down.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that adversaries are likely to use secondary C2 servers for communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
