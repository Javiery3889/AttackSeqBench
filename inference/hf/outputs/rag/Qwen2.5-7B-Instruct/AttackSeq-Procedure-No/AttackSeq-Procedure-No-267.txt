Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Korplug malware:
1. Collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
2. Proceeding with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
3. Gathering data from network shared drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from local systems, which also aligns with the first part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate the answer choices based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after collecting data from local systems and removable media, the malware will proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol and then gather data from network shared drives.
  - This sequence aligns well with the related TTPs (T1025 and T1005) and the question's description of the attack sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol before gathering data from network shared drives.
  - This does not align with the question's description, as it skips the step of exfiltration via a custom protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions: collecting data from local systems and removable media, then exfiltrating data via a custom protocol, and finally gathering data from network shared drives.
- The related TTPs (T1025 and T1005) support the first two steps of the sequence.
- The sequence described in the question and supported by the related TTPs is logical and consistent.

**Final Answer: A**
