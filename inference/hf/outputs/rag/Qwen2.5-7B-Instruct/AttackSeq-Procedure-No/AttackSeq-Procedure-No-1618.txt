Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions during the discovery phase:
1. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
2. Scanning for deleted files.
3. The question then asks if Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on the victim's email accounts to monitor network traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and its traffic, which aligns with the first two actions mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up forwarding rules on email accounts to monitor or exfiltrate data. This is the action in question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1040-Network Sniffing**: This is a technique used to gather information about the network, which is part of the discovery phase.
- **Technique T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This is a technique used to collect data by setting up forwarding rules on email accounts, which is a collection phase activity.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization**: This is part of the discovery phase.
2. **Scanning for Deleted Files**: This is also part of the discovery phase.
3. **Setting Auto-Forward Rules on Victim's Email Accounts**: This is a collection phase activity, which is a logical next step after gathering information and scanning for deleted files. It allows the attacker to monitor network traffic and potentially exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on the victim's email accounts to monitor network traffic after the initial discovery phase activities. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
