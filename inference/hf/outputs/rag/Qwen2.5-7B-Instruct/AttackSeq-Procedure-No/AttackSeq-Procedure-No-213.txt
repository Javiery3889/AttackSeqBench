Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
2. The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) only after proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Defense Evasion, T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves using legitimate names or locations to hide malicious activity.
- **Defense Evasion, T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification**: This technique involves modifying code signing policies to bypass security measures.
- **Defense Evasion, T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to achieve persistence or other malicious goals.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The question mentions persistence through copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2`. This aligns with T1112-Modify Registry.
- **Defense Evasion**: The question asks about using the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion via DKOM. This aligns with T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location and T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification.
- **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture**: These functionalities are not directly mentioned in the related TTPs but are common in many malware operations.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Persistence**: The initial actions (copying to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service) are already described and align with T1112-Modify Registry.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The Fire Chili kernel rootkit and DKOM are advanced techniques for Defense Evasion. However, the question does not specify that these actions are taken after system information discovery and screen capture.
3. **Sequence**: The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion after these actions. The related TTPs do not provide a clear sequence that includes system information discovery and screen capture before deploying the rootkit.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the question does not provide a clear sequence that includes system information discovery and screen capture before deploying the Fire Chili kernel rootkit. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
