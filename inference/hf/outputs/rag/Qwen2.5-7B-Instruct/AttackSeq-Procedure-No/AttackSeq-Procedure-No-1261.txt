Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems to identify potential targets.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a system by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView is a tool used for remote system discovery, which aligns with the T1018-Remote System Discovery technique.
  - SocGholish is a framework that can be delivered via compromised legitimate websites, which aligns with the T1189-Drive-by Compromise technique.
  - The sequence of using remote system discovery (T1018) before initial access (T1189) is a logical and common attack sequence. Attackers typically gather information about the network before attempting to gain initial access.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the attackers would not use remote system discovery before attempting initial access, which is less likely given the typical attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView is a tool used for remote system discovery, which is a common step in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the network.
- SocGholish, delivered via compromised legitimate websites, is a method of gaining initial access to a system.
- The logical sequence of gathering information (remote system discovery) before attempting to gain access (initial access) is a well-documented and common practice in cyber attacks.

### Final Answer: Yes
