Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Emissary Panda:
1. Scanning the network for vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.
2. Uploading a variety of tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro.
3. Performing execution only after exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. The question mentions exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access. The question mentions exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access, which aligns with this technique.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the related TTPs (Initial Access and Exploit Public-Facing Application) support the scenario where the adversary gains initial access through a public-facing application (SharePoint) and then performs further actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions that include gaining initial access through a public-facing application (SharePoint) and then performing further actions.
2. The related TTPs (Initial Access and Exploit Public-Facing Application) directly support this sequence.
3. The actions described in the question (scanning for vulnerabilities, uploading tools, and installing webshells) are consistent with the TTPs provided.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
