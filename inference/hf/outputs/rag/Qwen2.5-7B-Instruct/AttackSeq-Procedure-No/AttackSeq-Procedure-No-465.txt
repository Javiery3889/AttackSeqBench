Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The PowerLess Backdoor targets local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery.
2. It then attempts to achieve credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll'.
3. Finally, it uses a keylogger.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used for credential access:
- **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves using a keylogger to capture keystrokes.
- **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the LSASS process.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor will achieve credential access by first dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and then using a keylogger.
  - 'Comsvcs.dll' is not a standard technique for credential dumping. The related TTPs mention T1003.001-LSASS Memory and T1003-OS Credential Dumping, which are more likely to be used for credential dumping.
  - The sequence described in the question (dumping credentials first, then using a keylogger) is not aligned with the typical order of operations in these techniques. Keylogging is often used to capture credentials that are not yet available, such as those entered in a login screen.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor will not achieve credential access by first dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and then using a keylogger.
  - This is more plausible because the typical sequence would involve using a keylogger to capture credentials that are not yet available, and then possibly using other techniques like LSASS memory dump or OS credential dumping to extract additional credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that is not aligned with the typical techniques and order of operations for credential access.
- The related TTPs suggest that keylogging is often used to capture credentials that are not yet available, and credential dumping techniques are used to extract credentials from memory or the operating system.
- The sequence described in the question (dumping credentials first, then using a keylogger) is not a common or logical sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: B**
