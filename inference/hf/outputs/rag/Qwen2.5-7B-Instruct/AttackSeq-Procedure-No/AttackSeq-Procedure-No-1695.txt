Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Acquiring infrastructure (domains) for command and control (C2) servers.
2. Initiating the attack by sending spear phishing emails.
3. The spear phishing emails contain malicious attachments.
4. The malicious attachments exploit CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending malicious attachments via email to gain initial access to a system. This aligns with the question's description of sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly align with the spear phishing email described in the question.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Acquiring Infrastructure**: This is a preparatory step and is not directly related to the TTPs provided.
2. **Spear Phishing Emails**: This aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
3. **Exploiting CVE-2021-40444**: This is a specific exploit technique, but the related TTPs do not directly mention this specific CVE. However, the question implies that the spear phishing emails are used to deliver the exploit, which aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, which aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.

Final Answer: A
