Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by Korplug:
1. Data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.
2. Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.
3. Collection of metadata and content from mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control communications.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using a custom protocol for command and control communications, which is not part of standard application protocols.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It mentions data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages, which is consistent with the exfiltration technique (T1041). It also mentions communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports, which aligns with the command and control techniques (T1571 and T1095).
  - The sequence also includes the collection of metadata and content from various sources, which is a logical step before exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that Korplug does not follow the described steps, which contradicts the information provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions that Korplug is likely to perform.
- The related TTPs support the use of non-standard ports and custom protocols for command and control, as well as data exfiltration over a C2 channel.
- The sequence of actions (data exfiltration, collection of metadata and content, and then communication with C&C servers) is a logical and plausible sequence for a sophisticated malware like Korplug.

### Final Answer: Yes
