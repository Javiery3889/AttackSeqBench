Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the INOCNATION campaign:
1. Gaining initial access using a decoy installer for Cisco AnyConnect Mobility Client.
2. Executing a malicious DLL payload with anti-behavioral analysis techniques.
3. Utilizing defense evasion tactics such as XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, a mangled MZ header, and string stacking obfuscation.
4. Establishing command and control through encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections with additional XOR encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question asks if the campaign will use the specified defense evasion tactics only after establishing command and control. The related TTPs suggest that the campaign will use obfuscation techniques (XOR obfuscation, mangled MZ header, string stacking obfuscation) as part of its defense evasion strategy.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The campaign uses a decoy installer to gain initial access, which is a common technique.
2. **Payload Execution**: The malicious DLL payload is executed with anti-behavioral analysis techniques, indicating the campaign is aware of detection mechanisms.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The question mentions several defense evasion tactics, which align with the related TTPs (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information). These tactics are used to evade detection and analysis.
4. **Command and Control**: Establishing C2 through encrypted HTTPS with additional XOR encoding is a sophisticated method to maintain stealth and evade detection.

Given that the related TTPs specifically mention obfuscation techniques as part of the defense evasion strategy, it is reasonable to assume that these tactics would be used throughout the campaign, not just after establishing C2.

### Final Answer: B: No

The campaign is likely to use the specified defense evasion tactics (XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, mangled MZ header, and string stacking obfuscation) as part of its overall strategy, not exclusively after establishing C2. Therefore, the answer is "No."
