Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering system information from the infected machine.
2. Communicating between compromised hosts and their command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTP POST requests.
3. Uploading encoded system information using HTTP POST.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for exfiltration, which aligns with the communication between compromised hosts and C2 servers via HTTP POST requests.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the initial gathering of system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, and Proxy Server).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after gathering system information, NanHaiShu (a known APT group) would use HTTP POST requests to communicate with C2 servers and then upload the encoded system information.
  - This sequence aligns with the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs. T1082-System Information Discovery is used to gather the necessary information, and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is used to communicate and exfiltrate the data.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that NanHaiShu would not follow the described sequence.
  - Given the techniques and tactics involved, this does not align with the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question (gathering system information, communicating via HTTP POST, and then uploading encoded system information) is consistent with the techniques and tactics provided in the related TTPs.
- T1082-System Information Discovery is used to gather the necessary information, and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is used to communicate and exfiltrate the data.

**Final Answer: A**
