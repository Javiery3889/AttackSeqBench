Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network and system configurations.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and mapping internet connections.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of the implant performing initial reconnaissance, which typically involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, directly align with the concept of gathering network and system information, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - The T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel TTP is more about moving data out of the target environment, which is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Rising Sun implant is communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, which suggests it is already established and possibly performing some form of interaction with the target.
   - The related TTPs, especially T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, indicate that the implant is likely to gather information about the network and system configurations, which is a common step in initial reconnaissance.
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest the implant is not performing reconnaissance, and the related TTPs support the idea of gathering network and system information.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the Rising Sun implant is likely to perform initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
