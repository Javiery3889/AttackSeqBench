Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance and then communicates with the C2 (Command and Control) server. The specific communication method in question is whether it uses blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
- **Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves using web-based services for bidirectional communication between the attacker and the compromised system. Blogs and WordPress are web-based platforms, which align with this technique.
- **Initial Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance, which is a prerequisite for establishing a C2 channel.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: The question specifically asks about bidirectional communication, which is a key aspect of T1102.002.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance, which is a necessary step before establishing a C2 channel.
2. **Bidirectional Communication**: The question asks if the C2 communication is likely to use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. Blogs and WordPress are web-based platforms that can be used for such communication.
3. **Technique T1102.002**: This technique explicitly mentions using web-based services for bidirectional communication, which aligns with the use of blogs and WordPress.

Given the alignment of the related TTPs with the question and the specific technique mentioned, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant would use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
