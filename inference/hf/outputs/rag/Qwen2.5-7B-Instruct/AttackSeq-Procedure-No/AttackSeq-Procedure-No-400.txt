Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Employing a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence.
2. Creating a mutex called 'woolger' for defense evasion.
3. Communicating with C&C servers using legitimate websites like GitHub or Pastebin through dead drop resolvers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using dead drop resolvers to communicate with C&C servers.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of legitimate websites (GitHub or Pastebin) as dead drop resolvers (T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver) for C&C communication.
  - It also aligns with the use of web services (T1102-Web Service) for C&C communication.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware does not use legitimate websites for C&C communication, which contradicts the specific techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware uses legitimate websites (GitHub or Pastebin) for C&C communication.
- The related TTPs explicitly mention the use of dead drop resolvers (T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver) and web services (T1102-Web Service) for C&C communication.
- Both of these techniques are consistent with the use of legitimate websites for C&C communication.

### Final Answer: Yes
