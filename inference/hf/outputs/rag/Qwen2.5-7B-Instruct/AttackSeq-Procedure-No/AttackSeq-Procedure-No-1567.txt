Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Targeting user credentials using tools like procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process (T1003.001-LSASS Memory).
2. Proceeding to use BITS jobs as a defense evasion technique.
3. Abusing elevation control mechanisms.
4. Employing obfuscation techniques during privilege escalation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
- **Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves dumping the memory of the lsass process to extract credentials. This aligns with the first part of the question.
- **BITS Jobs**: This is a technique for defense evasion (T1136) where attackers use the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files or execute commands without user interaction. This is mentioned as a potential next step.
- **Abusing Elevation Control Mechanisms**: This is a technique (T1548) where attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher privileges.
- **Employing Obfuscation Techniques**: This is a technique (T1112) where attackers use various methods to hide their activities from detection.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This is the first step mentioned in the question.
2. **Abusing Elevation Control Mechanisms**: This is a logical next step after obtaining credentials, as the attacker would need to escalate privileges to maintain persistence or gain more access.
3. **Employing Obfuscation Techniques**: This is a common practice after gaining higher privileges to avoid detection.
4. **BITS Jobs**: This is a technique for defense evasion, which could be used after the attacker has gained higher privileges and is trying to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Based on the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of the attack, the most plausible sequence is:
- Targeting user credentials using T1003.001-LSASS Memory.
- Abusing elevation control mechanisms (T1548).
- Employing obfuscation techniques (T1112).
- Using BITS jobs as a defense evasion technique (T1136).

Therefore, the answer is:
Final Answer: Yes
