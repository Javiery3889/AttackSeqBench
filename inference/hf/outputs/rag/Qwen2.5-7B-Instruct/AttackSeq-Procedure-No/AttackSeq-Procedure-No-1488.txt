Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the BlackEnergy 3 malware:
1. Uses HTTP protocol to communicate with its C2 server.
2. Sends localization data and keyboard layout information.

The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox as part of its exfiltration process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the exfiltration techniques used by the malware:
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the malware automatically exfiltrating data without user interaction.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1020-Automated Exfiltration, support the idea that the malware can automatically exfiltrate data.
  - However, the question does not explicitly mention Dropbox as the exfiltration target. It only mentions HTTP communication and data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox.
  - While the related TTPs do not directly contradict this, they do not provide enough information to definitively rule out the possibility of exfiltration to Dropbox.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware using HTTP to communicate with its C2 server and exfiltrating localization data and keyboard layout information.
- The related TTPs indicate that the malware can automatically exfiltrate data, which aligns with the "Yes" choice.
- However, the question does not specify Dropbox as the target for exfiltration, and the related TTPs do not provide enough context to definitively conclude that Dropbox is the target.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the malware can automatically exfiltrate data, but the specific target (Dropbox) is not explicitly mentioned.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
