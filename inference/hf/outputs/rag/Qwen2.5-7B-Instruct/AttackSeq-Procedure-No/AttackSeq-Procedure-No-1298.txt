Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Credential Access: Using Procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
2. Pass-the-Hash: Using 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
3. Lateral Movement: Moving AvosLocker and tools across the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Credential Access**: T1003.001-LSASS Memory
- **Lateral Movement**: T1550.002-Pass the Hash

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if PDQ Deploy is likely to be used in the Fox Kitten Campaign for lateral movement after the initial credential access and pass-the-hash attacks.

- **Procdump and Mimikatz**: These tools are used for credential access.
- **Invoke the Hash**: This is a pass-the-hash attack technique.
- **PDQ Deploy**: This tool is primarily used for software deployment and management, not for lateral movement or malware distribution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Access**: The use of Procdump and Mimikatz is a common method for credential access.
2. **Pass-the-Hash**: The use of 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks is a known technique for gaining access to systems with the stolen credentials.
3. **Lateral Movement**: The question asks if PDQ Deploy is used for moving AvosLocker and tools for lateral movement. PDQ Deploy is not typically used for this purpose. More common tools for lateral movement include PsExec, WMI, or custom scripts.

Given the context and the nature of the tools involved, PDQ Deploy is not a typical choice for lateral movement in the context of the Fox Kitten Campaign.

### Final Answer: B: No
