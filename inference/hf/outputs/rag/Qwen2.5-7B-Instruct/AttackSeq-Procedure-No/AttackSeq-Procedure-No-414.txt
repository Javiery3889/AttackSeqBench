Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Using custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation.
2. **Access**: Abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services, which aligns with the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) mentioned in the question.
- **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain access to internal systems, which is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts, which aligns with the use of OAuth access tokens to gain access to email accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique is directly related to the RDP mentioned in the question, making it a strong candidate for the final step of lateral movement.
- **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique is not directly mentioned in the question and does not align with the use of OAuth access tokens.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique aligns with the use of OAuth access tokens to gain access to email accounts, which is the second step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The use of custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation is part of the Discovery phase.
2. **Access**: Abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts is a valid account technique (T1078).
3. **Lateral Movement**: Moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP is an exploitation of remote services technique (T1210).

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Reconnaissance**: T1059 (Use of Exfiltration Tools)
- **Access**: T1078 (Valid Accounts)
- **Lateral Movement**: T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services)

### Final Answer: A
