### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first verify victims' credentials in real-time and then prompt for the 2-step verification code.
   - The question then asks whether the attackers will use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using a malicious link in a phishing email to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves the attackers using compromised email accounts to send phishing emails.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using a spear-phishing link to gather information or gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs focus on spear-phishing links and the use of compromised email accounts. These techniques are more likely to involve the use of links rather than images in the phishing emails.
   - The question specifically asks about the use of images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. While this could be a tactic, it is not directly supported by the related TTPs, which emphasize the use of links and compromised accounts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the focus on spear-phishing links and the use of compromised email accounts, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.
   - Therefore, the answer is "No."

**Final Answer: B: No**
