### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using standard encoding methods for C2 communication.
     - **Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding methods for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system and network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the malware uses base64 encoding with a custom alphabet, which falls under the category of non-standard encoding (T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding).
   - After establishing a communication channel, the next logical step for a malware is often to gather information about the target environment to understand its capabilities and limitations. This aligns with the Tactic of Discovery and the Technique of System Information Discovery (T1082).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that after establishing a communication channel using non-standard encoding, the malware would proceed to perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
