Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malware connects back to a specific domain (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org) for command and control (C2) communication. It then asks if it is likely that the malware will use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1071)**
  - **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for C2 communication, which can be used to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1562)**
  - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after connecting to the C2 domain, the malware will use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.
  - Given the related TTPs, sideloading (T1574.002) is a common technique used for defense evasion (T1562). The question also mentions command and control communication, which aligns with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique for maintaining persistence.
  - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would use sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion after connecting to the C2 domain.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.
  - Given the related TTPs, sideloading is a well-known technique for defense evasion, and the question does not provide any information that would contradict the use of sideloading.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware connects to a C2 domain and then uses sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.
- The related TTPs include techniques for command and control communication and defense evasion, which support the use of sideloading.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

**Final Answer: A**
