Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions during the Discovery phase, where the malware collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate a download via FTP during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the data collection described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering files and directories, which is also not directly related to the data collection described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves the adversary using file transfer protocols, such as FTP, to transfer files. This is directly related to the question about initiating a download via FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs provide context that the malware is involved in the Discovery phase and has techniques for collecting various types of data.
   - The question then transitions to the Command and Control phase, where the malware is likely to use FTP for file transfer.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1071.002, directly support the use of FTP in the Command and Control phase.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in the Discovery phase, which is followed by a transition to the Command and Control phase.
   - The related TTPs, especially T1071.002, indicate that FTP is a technique used in the Command and Control phase for file transfer.
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after collecting the necessary data in the Discovery phase, the malware would use FTP to initiate a download during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
