Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where MsBuild.exe is being monitored as part of the Discovery tactic.
   - It then asks if SUNSPOT (a hypothetical actor) is likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them, as part of the Impact tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This indicates that the actor is looking for specific processes, such as MsBuild.exe, which is a legitimate build tool used in .NET development.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This suggests that the actor is interested in stealing financial information, which is a form of impact but not necessarily ransomware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after discovering MsBuild.exe, the actor will engage in double-extortion ransomware.
     - Double-extortion ransomware involves both encrypting files and exfiltrating them to threaten the victim with public release of data if the ransom is not paid.
     - The related TTPs do not directly mention ransomware or financial theft in the context of ransomware. Instead, they focus on process discovery and financial theft.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that after discovering MsBuild.exe, the actor will not engage in double-extortion ransomware.
     - Given the related TTPs, the actor is more likely to focus on financial theft rather than ransomware, which aligns more with the T1657-Financial Theft technique.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the actor is monitoring for MsBuild.exe, which is a process discovery activity.
   - The related TTPs mention financial theft as a form of impact, but do not specifically mention ransomware.
   - Double-extortion ransomware involves both encrypting and exfiltrating files, which is not directly supported by the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include double-extortion ransomware.

**Final Answer: B**
