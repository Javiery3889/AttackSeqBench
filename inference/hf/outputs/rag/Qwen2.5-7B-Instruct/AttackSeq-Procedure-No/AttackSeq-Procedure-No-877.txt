Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Naikon APT group:
1. **Discovery Tactic**: Gathering detailed system and network information using the Aria-body backdoor.
2. **Command and Control (C2) Tactic**: Sending collected data and listening for additional commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) for command and control.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering system and network information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question specifically mentions that the Aria-body backdoor is used for Discovery, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
- The question then asks if the group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands, which aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Phase**: The Aria-body backdoor is used to gather system and network information, which is consistent with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
2. **Command and Control Phase**: After gathering the information, the group is likely to use web protocols (HTTP, TCP) for sending the collected data and listening for additional commands, which is consistent with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the group uses web protocols for both sending collected data and listening for additional commands.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
