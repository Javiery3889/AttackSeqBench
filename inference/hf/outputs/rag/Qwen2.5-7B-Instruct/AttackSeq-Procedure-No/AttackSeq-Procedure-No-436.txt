### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document, which drops an HTA file.
   - The question then asks if the HTA file will communicate with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) before executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system. This aligns with the initial exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection. This aligns with the final step of executing the FinalBot backdoor.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. This is relevant to the question about communication for C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks about the communication channel (C2) before the final step of executing the FinalBot backdoor.
   - The related TTPs do not directly mention Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive. However, these cloud storage services are often used for C2 communications due to their availability and ease of use.
   - The technique T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication suggests that the HTA file would establish a communication channel, but it does not specify the exact service used.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the HTA file establishing a C2 channel, which could be with any of the mentioned cloud services (Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive).
   - However, the question asks if the HTA file will communicate with these services before executing the FinalBot backdoor. The related TTPs do not provide specific information about the exact service used, but they do suggest that such a communication channel would be established.

   - Since the question is asking for a plausible sequence and the related TTPs support the idea of C2 communication, the most plausible answer is that the HTA file would indeed communicate with one of these services for C2.

   - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
