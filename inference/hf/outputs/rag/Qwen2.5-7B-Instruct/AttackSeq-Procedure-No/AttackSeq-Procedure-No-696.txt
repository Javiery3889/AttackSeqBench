Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - Gamaredon gains initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task.
   - The goal is to achieve persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This indicates that the use of scheduled tasks is a technique for achieving persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This further confirms that the use of scheduled tasks is a method for executing malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of the `at` Windows task scheduler tool. The related TTPs confirm that scheduled tasks are a technique used for both persistence and execution.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (initial access through malicious documents, then using the `at` tool to schedule and execute a task, and finally achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the registry) aligns with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial access through malicious documents is a common method used by threat actors.
   - Using the `at` tool to schedule and execute a task is a plausible method to ensure the malware runs at a later time, which is a form of persistence.
   - Registering a RUN key in the Windows registry is another method to ensure persistence, as the malware will run every time the system starts.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question is consistent with the techniques and tactics provided in the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
