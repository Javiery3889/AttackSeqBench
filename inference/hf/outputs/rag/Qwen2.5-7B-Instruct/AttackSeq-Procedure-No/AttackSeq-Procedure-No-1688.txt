Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.
2. Using ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials.
3. Uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to intercept and steal credentials.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique is also mentioned here, indicating its relevance to the collection of credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. ARP cache poisoning (T1557.002) is a technique used to collect credentials, which fits the tactic of Credential Access.
  - The question also mentions uploading these credentials to an external FTP server, which is consistent with the tactic of Collection.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to collect credentials, and there is no indication that it would be used for other purposes.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where ARP cache poisoning is used to collect credentials, which is a direct application of the T1557.002 technique.
- The collected credentials are then uploaded to an external FTP server, which is consistent with the tactic of Collection.
- The related TTPs confirm that ARP cache poisoning is indeed a technique used for Credential Access and Collection.

### Final Answer: Yes
