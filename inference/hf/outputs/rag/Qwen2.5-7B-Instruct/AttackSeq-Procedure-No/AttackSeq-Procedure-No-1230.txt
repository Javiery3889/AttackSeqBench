Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
1. Establishing command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware.
2. Polling remote C&C servers for tasks and executing commands.

The question then asks if it is likely that they engaged in double-extortion ransomware, which involves:
1. Exfiltrating files.
2. Encrypting the files to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This TTP involves the group exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.
- **Financial Theft (Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft)**: This TTP involves the group stealing financial information, which can be used for financial gain.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The question describes a sequence that includes exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to prompt a ransom. This aligns with the TTPs of exfiltration and financial theft.
  - The use of backdoor malware to establish C&C communication and execute commands is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors like Lazarus.
  - The exfiltration of files and subsequent encryption to demand a ransom is a well-known tactic in ransomware attacks, including double-extortion ransomware.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the Lazarus group did not engage in the described sequence of actions, which does not align with the information provided in the question and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that aligns with the TTPs of exfiltration and financial theft.
- The use of backdoor malware to establish C&C communication and execute commands is a common tactic.
- The exfiltration of files and subsequent encryption to demand a ransom is a well-known tactic in ransomware attacks, including double-extortion ransomware.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
