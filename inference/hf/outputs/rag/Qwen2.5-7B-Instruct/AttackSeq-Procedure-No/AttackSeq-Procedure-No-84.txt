Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where files are compressed using zlib during the Collection tactic. It then asks if it is likely that Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16MB) or more during the Exfiltration tactic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection Tactic, Technique T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves compressing files using a library, which aligns with the use of zlib mentioned in the question.
- **Exfiltration Tactic, Technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves managing the size of data being exfiltrated, which could include dividing files to stay under a certain size limit.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Vyveva will divide files if they are 16MB or larger during the Exfiltration phase.
  - Given the Exfiltration technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, it is plausible that Vyveva would implement a strategy to manage file sizes, especially if they exceed a certain threshold (16MB in this case).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Vyveva will not divide files if they are 16MB or larger during the Exfiltration phase.
  - This would be less plausible given the need to manage data transfer size, as dividing files to stay under a certain size limit is a common practice in data exfiltration to avoid detection or to meet specific transfer constraints.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where files are compressed and then potentially divided based on size during the Exfiltration phase.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, indicate that managing file sizes is a common practice in data exfiltration.
- Given the need to manage file sizes and the specific threshold of 16MB, it is reasonable to assume that Vyveva would implement a strategy to divide files if they exceed this size.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
