Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. The adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link.
2. This is part of the Initial Access phase.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This technique involves the use of scripting languages to execute code.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This technique involves the development and use of custom malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access Phase**: The question mentions sending emails with a PDF link, which is a common method for Initial Access.
- **Resource Development Phase**: The question asks about the use of custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

Given the related TTPs:
- **T1587.001-Malware** directly relates to the development and use of custom malware, which aligns with the Resource Development phase.
- **T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT** are techniques for execution, which could be used to deploy malware but are not directly related to the development of custom malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is specifically asking about the use of custom malware during the Resource Development phase.
- The related TTPs mention the development and use of custom malware (T1587.001-Malware).
- The use of Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, which are custom malware, fits well within the context of Resource Development.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary will indeed use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
