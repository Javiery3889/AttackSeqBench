Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Emissary Panda exploited a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.
2. They installed webshells on SharePoint servers.
3. They sent Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials.
4. They scanned the network for subsequently vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic is correctly identified in the question as the first step, where Emissary Panda exploited a vulnerability to gain initial access.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This technique is also correctly identified as the method used to exploit the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604).

However, the question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access, they would send Telegram messages to harvest credentials and then scan the network for subsequent vulnerabilities. The related TTPs do not directly address the steps of sending Telegram messages or scanning for subsequent vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1:** Emissary Panda successfully exploited a vulnerability to gain initial access, which is a valid and common tactic.
- **Step 2:** Installing webshells on SharePoint servers is a plausible action to maintain persistence and further explore the network.
- **Step 3:** Sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials is a sophisticated social engineering technique, but it is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
- **Step 4:** Scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems through tools targeting CVE-2017-0144 is a logical next step after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

Given the provided TTPs, the sequence of actions described in the question includes steps that are not directly supported by the related TTPs. While the initial access and exploitation are valid, the subsequent steps of sending Telegram messages and scanning for vulnerabilities are not directly aligned with the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
