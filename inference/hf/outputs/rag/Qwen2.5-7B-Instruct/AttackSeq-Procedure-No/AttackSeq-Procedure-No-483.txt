Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Running `cmd.exe` commands.
2. Executing SparrowDoor for Execution.
3. Communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain initial access to a network.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
  - This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that SparrowDoor was used to exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access.
  - The related TTP "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application" directly supports this scenario, as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that SparrowDoor was not used to exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.
  - The related TTP "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application" does not support this scenario, as it is specifically about exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include running `cmd.exe` commands and executing SparrowDoor for Execution, which aligns with the TTP "T1059.003-Windows Command Shell" under the Tactic of Execution.
- The question also mentions communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel, which is a common method for Command and Control (C2) communication.
- The related TTP "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application" under the Tactic of Initial Access directly supports the idea that SparrowDoor was used to exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SparrowDoor was indeed used to exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

**Final Answer: A**
