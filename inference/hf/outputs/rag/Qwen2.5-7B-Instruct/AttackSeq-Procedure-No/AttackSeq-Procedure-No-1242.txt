Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Data collection using crafted modules (like pr.dll).
2. Uploading stolen information to a C&C server.
3. A potential file division if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more.
4. Targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection or to comply with specific transfer constraints.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique aligns with the first part of the question, where data is collected and uploaded to a C&C server.
- **Technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique suggests that there might be constraints on the size of data transferred, which could lead to file division if the size exceeds a certain limit.

Given that the question mentions a potential file division if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more, this aligns with the concept of data transfer size limits. APT28, known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, might implement such a technique to avoid detection or to comply with specific transfer constraints.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection**: APT28 uses crafted modules (like pr.dll) to collect data.
2. **Exfiltration**: The collected data is uploaded to a C&C server, which aligns with T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
3. **File Division**: If the size of the data exceeds 0x1000000 bytes, APT28 might divide the files to avoid detection or to comply with specific transfer constraints, which aligns with T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 will indeed divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more.

**Final Answer: A**
