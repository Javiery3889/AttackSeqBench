Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.
2. Recon information is sent or files are downloaded.
3. Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper.
4. CaddyWiper is used to wipe files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the destruction of data to prevent its use by the victim or to make it unrecoverable. This aligns with the described action of wiping files and partitions.
- **T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**: This technique involves wiping the disk structure, which can include wiping partitions and other disk structures. This also aligns with the described action of wiping physical drive partitions.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **IPsec Helper**: This is a technique used to establish secure communication channels, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Recon Information or File Download**: This suggests that the attacker is gathering information or deploying malware.
3. **CaddyWiper Deployment**: CaddyWiper is a known malware that is used for data destruction, which aligns with the TTPs related to data destruction and disk structure wiping.
4. **Wiping Files and Partitions**: The actions described (wiping files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions) are consistent with the techniques T1485-Data Destruction and T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the described actions, and the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
