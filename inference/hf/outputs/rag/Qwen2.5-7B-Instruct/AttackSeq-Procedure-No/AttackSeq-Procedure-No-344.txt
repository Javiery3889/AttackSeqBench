Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker after identifying a zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer. The sequence includes:
1. The zero-day exploit executing native Windows functions.
2. Bypassing ASLR and DEP protections.
3. Executing shellcode that downloads the next stage payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client system.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The zero-day exploit would execute native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) as part of the exploitation process.
  - The exploit would then bypass ASLR and DEP to execute shellcode.
  - The shellcode would download the next stage payload.
  - This sequence aligns with the techniques of T1203 (exploitation for client execution) and T1574.002 (DLL side-loading), which are relevant to the question.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - If the answer is "No," it would imply that the zero-day exploit does not execute native Windows functions, which contradicts the typical behavior of such exploits.
  - It would also imply that the exploit does not bypass ASLR and DEP, which is a common technique to ensure persistence and evade detection.
  - This sequence does not align with the techniques of T1203 and T1574.002.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a typical sequence of actions in a zero-day exploit, which includes executing native functions, bypassing security mechanisms, and downloading the next stage payload.
- The related TTPs (T1203 and T1574.002) support the idea that the exploit would execute native functions and bypass security measures.
- Answer Choice A aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
