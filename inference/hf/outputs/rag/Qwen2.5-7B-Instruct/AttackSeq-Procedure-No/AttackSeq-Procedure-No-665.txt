Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
2. Employing Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash for credential access.
3. Moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.
4. Performing permission groups discovery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **Credential Access**: T1003.001-LSASS Memory (related to Mimikatz)
- **Lateral Movement**: T1550.002-Pass the Hash (related to Impacket tools and AntSword webshells)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if permission groups discovery is a likely next step after the described actions.

- **Mimikatz and Pass-the-Hash**: These actions are used to gain initial access and escalate privileges.
- **Lateral Movement**: This involves moving to other systems within the network, which is a common step after gaining initial access.
- **Permission Groups Discovery**: This is a step that would follow lateral movement to understand the permissions and access levels available on other systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The use of Mimikatz and pass-the-hash indicates that the threat actors have gained initial access to a system.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec, the threat actors move to other systems within the network.
3. **Permission Groups Discovery**: After moving laterally, the threat actors would likely want to understand the permissions and access levels available on the new systems. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to identify potential targets and escalate privileges.

Given this reasoning, it is highly plausible that the threat actors would perform permission groups discovery after moving laterally.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
