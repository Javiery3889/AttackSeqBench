Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials.
2. They dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.
3. The question asks if it is likely that they established command and control by using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**: This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel, which fits the description of using GitLab and Digital Point for command and control.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally within the network, which aligns with the use of the NodeIISWeb web shell loader for lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel, which does not fit the description of one-way communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of one-way communication via GitLab and Digital Point, which is a valid TTP for command and control.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the use of GitLab and Digital Point for command and control is not a valid TTP, which contradicts the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes lateral movement and command and control.
- The related TTPs confirm that one-way communication (T1102.003) is a valid technique for command and control.
- GitLab and Digital Point are mentioned as potential methods for one-way communication, which fits the TTP described in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
