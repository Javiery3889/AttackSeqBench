Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery activities to collect system and network information.
2. Use of Google Drive for C2.
3. Communication with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
4. Leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves standard encoding methods, which might not align with the use of a custom base64 alphabet.
- **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves non-standard encoding methods, which could include a custom base64 alphabet.
- **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves bidirectional communication, which is relevant for maintaining a persistent connection but not directly related to the encoding or C2 method.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - Google Drive for C2 (T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding): This aligns with the use of a non-standard method for C2.
  - Encrypted and base64-encoded commands (T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding): This aligns with the use of a non-standard encoding method.
  - Custom base64 alphabet (T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding): This aligns with the use of a non-standard encoding method.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware does not use Google Drive for C2, does not use encrypted and base64-encoded commands, or does not use a custom base64 alphabet. Given the question's description, this does not align with the provided information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that involves non-standard encoding and the use of a custom base64 alphabet, which aligns with the TTPs related to non-standard encoding (T1132.002).
- The use of Google Drive for C2 is also a plausible method for C2 communication.
- The combination of these techniques (non-standard encoding and custom base64 alphabet) is consistent with the described sequence.

### Final Answer: Yes
