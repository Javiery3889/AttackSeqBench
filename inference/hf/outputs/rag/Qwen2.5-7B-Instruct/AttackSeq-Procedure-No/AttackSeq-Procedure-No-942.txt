Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by SLUB malware:
     - It collects system information.
     - It captures screenshots.
     - It interacts with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - T1041 specifically refers to exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the question's context of exfiltrating data to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the described actions and the related TTPs. If the malware is collecting and capturing data during the Discovery phase, it is reasonable to assume that it would exfiltrate this data to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the described actions and the related TTPs. If the malware is collecting and capturing data, it would be unusual for it not to exfiltrate this data to the C2 server.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware is described as collecting system information and capturing screenshots, which are actions typically associated with reconnaissance and data gathering.
   - The interaction with the Mattermost server during the Discovery phase suggests that the malware is establishing a foothold and possibly gathering additional information.
   - The related TTPs specifically mention exfiltration over a C2 channel, which is a common method for malware to send collected data to its command and control server.
   - Given these points, it is highly plausible that the malware would exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
