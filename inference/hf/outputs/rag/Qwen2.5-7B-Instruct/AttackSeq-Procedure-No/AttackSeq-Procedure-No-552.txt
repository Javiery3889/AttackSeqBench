### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a skip-2.0 backdoor is used to gain stealth and evade event logging.
   - The next step in the sequence is to use a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights to start collecting emails from targeted mailboxes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions:** This technique involves adding additional permissions to an email delegate, which aligns with the part of the question about collecting emails.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using cloud accounts to evade detection, which aligns with the part of the question about using a compromised global administrator account.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique also involves using cloud accounts to gain initial access, which is relevant to the compromised global administrator account.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is plausible.
     - The use of a compromised global administrator account to backdoor a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights aligns with the technique T1078.004-Cloud Accounts, which is relevant to both defense evasion and initial access.
     - The subsequent step of collecting emails from targeted mailboxes aligns with the technique T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - There is no clear contradiction or infeasibility in the described sequence of TTPs based on the related techniques.

### Final Answer:
