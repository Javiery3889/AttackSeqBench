Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. **Tropic Trooper** uses **DLL hijacking** (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) to load a malicious `wab32res.dll` through a benign file during the **Defense Evasion** phase.
2. The question then asks if it is likely that **TClient** will use **email for C2 via an Office macro** during the **Command and Control** phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** (already mentioned in the question)
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL through a benign file, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` utility to execute a malicious DLL, which is another method of executing a malicious payload.

The question does not provide any direct information about TClient using email for C2 via an Office macro. However, the related TTPs do not directly address the C2 phase or the use of email and Office macros.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the **Defense Evasion** phase and the use of DLL hijacking.
- The related TTPs do not provide any information about the **Command and Control** phase or the use of email and Office macros.
- There is no direct link between the provided TTPs and the specific C2 method described in the question.

Given the lack of direct evidence or context linking TClient to using email for C2 via an Office macro, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
