Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compressing files with zlib for transmission to the C&C server.
2. Collecting files from the computer.
3. The collection of files is contingent upon obtaining specific system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting files after obtaining system information.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and local IP address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor will indeed collect files only after obtaining the specified system information.
  - The related TTPs (T1005 and T1082) support this sequence, as they both involve gathering system information and data from the local system, which is a prerequisite for file collection.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor will collect files without first obtaining the specified system information.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as the collection of files (T1005) is typically preceded by the discovery of system information (T1082).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the backdoor first obtains system information and then collects files.
- The related TTPs (T1005 and T1082) support this sequence, indicating that system information is gathered before data collection.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will collect files only after obtaining the specified system information.

**Final Answer: A**
