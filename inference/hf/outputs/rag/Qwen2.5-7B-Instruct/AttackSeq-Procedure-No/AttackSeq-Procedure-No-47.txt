Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers to bypass network segmentation.
2. Conducting discovery activities such as file and directory discovery.
3. Utilizing the Responder tool to harvest credentials during credential access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning network protocols to harvest credentials.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if the Lazarus group would conduct file and directory discovery only after utilizing the Responder tool to harvest credentials.

- **Technique T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay** (Credential Access): This technique is used to harvest credentials, which is a prerequisite for accessing files and directories.
- **Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is used to discover files and directories, which is a step in the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Lateral Movement**: The group has already achieved lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers.
2. **Credential Harvesting**: The Responder tool is used to harvest credentials, which is a critical step in gaining access to resources.
3. **Discovery**: After obtaining credentials, the group would likely proceed to discover files and directories to identify valuable targets.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the Lazarus group would conduct file and directory discovery after utilizing the Responder tool to harvest credentials. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
