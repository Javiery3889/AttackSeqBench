Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF files.
2. Using a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system.
3. Establishing communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
  - This technique involves using hidden file systems to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** is directly related to the first step in the sequence, which is delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file.
- **Technique T1564.005-Hidden File System** is related to the second step, which involves using a hidden file system to evade detection.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)**: The spyware is delivered via a spearphishing email, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
2. **Defense Evasion (T1564.005-Hidden File System)**: Once the spyware is on the system, it uses a hidden file system (in this case, a portable FAT16 partition image in %TEMP%) to evade detection by security software and the user.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the techniques provided. The spyware is delivered via a spearphishing email and then uses a hidden file system to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
