Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals have reinstalled malware on internal sites of compromised organizations using infrastructure software. The question then asks whether, during the discovery phase, cybercriminals are more likely to collect the timestamp from the victim's machine rather than using remote administration tools to explore financial systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker collecting the system time from the victim's machine. This is relevant to the question as it pertains to the discovery phase.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp**: This technique involves modifying the timestamp of files to evade detection. While this is related to defense evasion, it does not directly address the question about the discovery phase.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique involves stealing financial data. While this is relevant to the ultimate goal of the attack, it does not directly address the discovery phase either.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the technique T1124-System Time Discovery, which is directly related to the discovery phase and collecting the timestamp from the victim's machine.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that cybercriminals are more likely to use remote administration tools to explore financial systems during the discovery phase, which is not supported by the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the discovery phase, which is directly related to the technique T1124-System Time Discovery.
- The related TTPs do not support the use of remote administration tools for discovery; instead, they focus on collecting system time and modifying timestamps.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to collect the timestamp from the victim's machine during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A**
