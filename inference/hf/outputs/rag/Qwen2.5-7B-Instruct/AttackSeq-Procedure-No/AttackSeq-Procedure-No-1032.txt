### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: using ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information.
   - It then asks if it is likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1606.002-SAML Tokens**
     - This technique involves the use of SAML tokens for credential access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods to bypass security controls.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of using a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
   - The related TTPs indicate that SAML tokens can be used for credential access and that alternative authentication methods can be used for both defense evasion and lateral movement.
   - Given that the question involves a compromised AD FS server and the use of SAML tokens, it aligns well with the technique of using SAML tokens for credential access (T1606.002-SAML Tokens).
   - The technique of using alternative authentication material (T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material) is also relevant, as it supports the idea of using SAML tokens for lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is plausible that attackers would use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement, as this aligns with the techniques of both credential access and lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs supports the likelihood of this action.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
