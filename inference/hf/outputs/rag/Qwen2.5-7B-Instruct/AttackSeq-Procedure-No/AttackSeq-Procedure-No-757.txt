Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Data exfiltration using Base64 encoding.
2. Communication with the control server via an encrypted channel using RC4.
3. Initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1083)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. Base64 encoding is a standard encoding method.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1027)**
  - **Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves using encryption or encoding to evade detection. RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1140)**
  - **Technique: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating information to reveal its true nature.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question:
    1. Data exfiltration using Base64 encoding (T1132.001-Standard Encoding).
    2. Communication with the control server via an encrypted channel using RC4 (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File).
    3. Initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information (which is a common initial step in many attack sequences).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the Rising Sun implant does not use Base64 encoding for data exfiltration or RC4 for encrypted communication, which contradicts the information provided in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes Base64 encoding for data exfiltration and RC4 for encrypted communication, which are both supported by the related TTPs.
- The sequence also includes initial reconnaissance, which is a common step in many attack sequences.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
