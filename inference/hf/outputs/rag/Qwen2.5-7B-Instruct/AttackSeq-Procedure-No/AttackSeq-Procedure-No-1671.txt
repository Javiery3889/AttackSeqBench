### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: reconnaissance followed by the use of spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access.
   - The question specifically asks if the Dark Seoul attackers used spear-phishing emails for this purpose.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad technique that includes both spear-phishing links and spear-phishing attachments.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a malicious link via email.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions "spear-phishing emails" to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - The related TTPs include both spear-phishing links and spear-phishing attachments, which are both forms of spear-phishing emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question specifies "spear-phishing emails" and the related TTPs include both spear-phishing links and spear-phishing attachments, it is plausible that the Dark Seoul attackers used either of these methods to deliver the trojanized software.
   - Since the question does not specify whether the email contained a link or an attachment, both methods are valid and plausible.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: A (Yes)
