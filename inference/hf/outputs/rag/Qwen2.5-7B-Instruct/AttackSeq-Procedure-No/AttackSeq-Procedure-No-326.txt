Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. XAgent app executes on iOS 7 devices.
2. The app hides its icon and runs in the background.
3. The app identifies Domain Administrators.
4. The app sends gathered information, including processes data, to a C2 server via HTTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1069.002-Domain Groups**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating domain groups.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.002-Domain Account**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating domain accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1069.002-Domain Groups**: This technique is about identifying and enumerating domain groups, which can include Domain Administrators.
- **Technique T1087.002-Domain Account**: This technique is about identifying and enumerating domain accounts, which can also include Domain Administrators.

The question specifically asks if the app will use `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` to identify Domain Administrators. This command is a specific method to list members of a domain group, which aligns with the T1069.002 technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that includes identifying Domain Administrators.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for identifying domain groups and domain accounts, which can include Domain Administrators.
- The specific command `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` is a method to list members of the Domain Administrators group, which aligns with the T1069.002 technique.

Given the context and the specific command mentioned, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the app will use the `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` command to identify Domain Administrators.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
