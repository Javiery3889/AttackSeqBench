Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initiate cleanup procedures for defense evasion if communication fails.
2. Inject code into a Microsoft Exchange Server process.
3. Use command-line arguments to establish communication with the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Defense Evasion (T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing)**: This technique involves manipulating process arguments to evade detection.
- **Command and Control (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication)**: This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.
- **Defense Evasion (T1055-Process Injection)**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1055-Process Injection**: This TTP aligns with the action of injecting code into a Microsoft Exchange Server process.
- **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This TTP aligns with the action of using command-line arguments to establish communication with the C&C server.
- **T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing**: This TTP is more about manipulating process arguments, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initiate Cleanup Procedures for Defense Evasion**: This is a general action and does not directly align with any specific TTP.
2. **Inject Code into a Microsoft Exchange Server Process**: This aligns with T1055-Process Injection.
3. **Use Command-Line Arguments to Establish Communication with C&C Server**: This aligns with T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns best with the TTPs T1055-Process Injection and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
