Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. External communication for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.
2. Configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication over HTTPS.
3. Use of a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves scheduling data transfers to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence:
    1. The malware communicates externally for exfiltration (T1029-Scheduled Transfer).
    2. It configures a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
    3. It uses HTTPS for the C&C communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
    4. It uses a custom cryptographic protocol for the C&C communication, which is a plausible extension of the web protocol technique.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence. It would imply that the malware does not configure a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication, which contradicts the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first exfiltrates data externally and then configures a specific domain and IP address for C&C communication over HTTPS, using a custom cryptographic protocol.
- The related TTPs (T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1071.001-Web Protocols) support this sequence.
- Answer Choice A is the only option that aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
