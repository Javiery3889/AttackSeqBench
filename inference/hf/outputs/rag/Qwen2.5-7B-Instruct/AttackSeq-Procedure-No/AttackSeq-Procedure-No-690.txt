### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first gain initial access using tools like Advanced IP Scanner and PushVNC.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they will use APC injection to execute commands received from C2 as part of their defense evasion tactics.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC)**
     - This technique is directly related to the question and is a method used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC)**
     - This technique is also related but more focused on privilege escalation rather than defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about defense evasion tactics.
   - The related TTPs mention APC injection under both defense evasion and privilege escalation tactics.
   - However, the question is more aligned with the defense evasion tactic, as it is asking about executing commands received from C2, which is a common defense evasion technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that APC injection is a technique used for both defense evasion and privilege escalation, but the question is specifically about defense evasion, the most plausible answer is that it is indeed likely that attackers would use APC injection as part of their defense evasion tactics.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
