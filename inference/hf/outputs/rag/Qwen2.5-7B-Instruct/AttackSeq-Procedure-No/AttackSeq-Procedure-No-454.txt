Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether APT-TOCS, after exhibiting lateral movement through network projection within the internal network, is likely to communicate using removable media for command and control operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This TTP involves the use of removable media to move data or malware across network segments.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
  - This TTP involves using removable media for command and control operations, such as exfiltrating data or receiving instructions.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after lateral movement, APT-TOCS would use removable media for command and control operations.
  - The related TTPs (T1091 and T1092) both involve the use of removable media, but T1092 specifically addresses command and control operations.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that APT-TOCS would not use removable media for command and control operations after lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the likelihood of APT-TOCS using removable media for command and control operations after lateral movement.
- The related TTPs indicate that removable media can be used for both lateral movement and command and control operations.
- Given that the question specifically asks about command and control operations, and T1092 directly addresses this, it is plausible that APT-TOCS would use removable media for command and control operations.

### Final Answer: A
