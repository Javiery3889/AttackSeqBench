Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the SLUB backdoor downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub, parses it for commands, and then performs some action.
   - The specific action in question is whether the attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and building CAB files before posting download links to the Slack channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves archiving data using a utility, which aligns with the action of creating archive files.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is relevant to the exfiltration of data from the user's Desktop.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the action of posting download links to the Slack channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are likely to collect data from the local system and then exfiltrate it over a C2 channel.
   - Creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and building CAB files (a type of archive file) is a plausible method for data collection and preparation for exfiltration.
   - Posting download links to the Slack channel is a method of exfiltration over a C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the described actions, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
   - Therefore, the attackers are likely to follow the described sequence of actions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
