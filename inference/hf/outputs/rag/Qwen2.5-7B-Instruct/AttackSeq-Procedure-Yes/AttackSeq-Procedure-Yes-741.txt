### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Desert Falcons, who used homemade backdoors for Command and Control activities, also conducted spear phishing emails and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the Tactic of Initial Access and specifically mention Spear Phishing techniques (both link and attachment methods).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, which indicate that spear phishing is a common method for achieving Initial Access.
     - Spear phishing is a social engineering technique that can be used to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or opening attachments, which can then lead to the installation of backdoors or other malicious software.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the common practice of using spear phishing for Initial Access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the Desert Falcons likely used spear phishing emails and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access, given the related TTPs provided.

Final Answer: A
