Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Pierogi backdoor:
1. Conducts discovery activities by collecting system information.
2. Communicates with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery** is a technique that involves gathering information about the target system, such as the computer name, username, and operating system version. This aligns with the first part of the question, where the backdoor is described as conducting discovery activities by collecting system information.
- The question then asks if the backdoor is likely to communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands. This part of the question is not directly covered by the provided TTPs, but it is a common behavior for backdoors to communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Activities**: The question mentions that the backdoor conducts discovery activities by collecting system information. This aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
2. **Communication with C2 Servers**: While the provided TTPs do not explicitly cover the communication with C2 servers, it is a common and expected behavior for backdoors to establish communication with C2 servers for command and control purposes. The use of predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands is a typical method used by backdoors to maintain persistence and evade detection.

Given the context and the common behavior of backdoors, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will indeed communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands.

### Final Answer: A
