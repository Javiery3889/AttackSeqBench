Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by FIN13:
1. Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
2. Employs passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
3. Uses other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique involves using web shells to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which can include web shells and other methods.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware for initial access, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Passive Backdoors**: BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution. This aligns with the second part of the question.
- **Persistence**: The question mentions using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries. This aligns with the persistence tactic.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware, which is consistent with the deployment of web shells.
2. **Passive Backdoors**: BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that fits the description of establishing a local HTTP server for command execution.
3. **Persistence**: SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are methods to establish persistence, which is a common tactic in maintaining long-term access.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
