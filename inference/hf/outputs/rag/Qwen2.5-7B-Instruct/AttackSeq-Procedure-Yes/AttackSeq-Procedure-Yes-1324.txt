Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by CosmicDuke:
1. Searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.
2. Using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information.
3. Exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the collection and exfiltration techniques:
- **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which aligns with the use of a keylogger.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the use of a screenshotter and clipboard stealer.
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data to an external server, which aligns with the exfiltration via FTP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer for data collection, and the exfiltration via FTP, which are all supported by the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that CosmicDuke does not use these specific tools for data collection and exfiltration, which contradicts the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include data collection using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, followed by exfiltration via FTP.
- The related TTPs support the use of keylogging, data collection from the local system, and automated exfiltration.
- Answer Choice A aligns perfectly with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
