Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a threat actor (Buckeye) has already used keylogging and tools like ChromePass and Lazagne to gather credentials. The question then asks whether Buckeye is likely to focus on file and print servers to collect data from network shared drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves the use of keyloggers to capture keystrokes, which aligns with the initial step of gathering credentials.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves accessing and exfiltrating data from network shared drives, which is directly related to the question's focus on collecting data from network shared drives.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves accessing credentials stored in files, which is relevant to the initial step of gathering credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. After gathering credentials (T1552.001), the next logical step would be to use those credentials to access and collect data from network shared drives (T1039).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs. If Buckeye has already gathered credentials, it would be reasonable to use those credentials to access and collect data from network shared drives.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Buckeye has already gathered credentials using keyloggers and other tools.
- The related TTPs confirm that the next logical step would be to use those credentials to access and collect data from network shared drives.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Buckeye is likely to focus on file and print servers to collect data from network shared drives.

**Final Answer: A**
