Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor is used to collect machine information and take screenshots during the Discovery and Collection tactics.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining perishable channels with a target to deliver commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for communication, which can include encrypted channels to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system.
   - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots from the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of the backdoor using an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server during the Command and Control phase.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, suggest that adversaries often use encrypted channels to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - The backdoor's function of collecting machine information and taking screenshots (which are part of the Collection tactic) implies that the backdoor is operational and could be used for Command and Control activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor is already established and functional for collecting information and taking screenshots.
   - To maintain operational security and avoid detection, it is highly likely that the backdoor would use an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server.
   - The T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique supports the use of encrypted channels for C2 communications.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the backdoor is likely to communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: Final Answer: A: Yes
