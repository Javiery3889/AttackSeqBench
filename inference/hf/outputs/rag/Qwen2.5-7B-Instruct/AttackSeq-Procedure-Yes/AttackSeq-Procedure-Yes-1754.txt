Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Shuckworm:
1. Executing malicious VBS scripts.
2. Deploying a custom backdoor.
3. Using `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions.
4. Employing HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.005-Mshta**
  - This technique involves using `mshta.exe` to execute malicious code, which is a common method to bypass application control solutions.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
  - This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts (VBS) to execute code, which aligns with the first step in the sequence (executing malicious VBS scripts).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the use of `mshta.exe` (T1218.005) to bypass application control solutions, which is a common tactic used by adversaries to execute malicious payloads.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that Shuckworm does not use `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions, which contradicts the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Shuckworm uses `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions, which is a well-documented technique (T1218.005).
- The related TTPs confirm the use of `mshta.exe` (T1218.005) and VBS scripts (T1059.005) in the context of the question.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes the use of `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions.

**Final Answer: A**
