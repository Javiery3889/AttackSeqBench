Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Yellow Garuda:
1. Collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts.
2. Uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to perform the collection.
3. Exfiltrates the collected data over the web.
4. Stores the exfiltrated data in an SQLite database and JSON format.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. While this is related to exfiltration, it does not specify the format or storage method.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from various repositories, which aligns with the initial collection of data from Telegram accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. After collecting data, it is plausible that the data would be exfiltrated over the web and then stored in an SQLite database and JSON format.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions. If the data is not exfiltrated and stored in the specified formats, it contradicts the sequence provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a clear sequence of actions: collection, exfiltration, and storage.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1213 for collection and T1041 for exfiltration, support the described sequence.
- The storage in SQLite and JSON formats is a plausible method for storing exfiltrated data.

### Final Answer: Yes
