Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a RAT component of Matryoshka ensures persistence by creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot. The question then asks whether the CopyKittens group is likely to use a global mutex to reduce the risk of multiple RAT instances running simultaneously.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves creating registry keys or shortcuts in the startup folder to ensure that malware runs automatically when the system boots.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves creating files in specific directories (e.g., Startup folder) to ensure that malware runs when the system boots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique focuses on ensuring that the malware runs automatically upon system boot by creating registry keys or shortcuts. It does not inherently address the issue of multiple instances running simultaneously.
- **Technique T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is similar to T1547.001 but is more broadly focused on autostart execution, which can include various methods such as registry keys, startup folders, and other autostart locations.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given that the question specifically mentions the creation of a registry key for persistence, the focus is on ensuring that the malware runs automatically upon system boot. The related TTPs do not directly mention the use of a global mutex to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously. While a global mutex could be a useful technique to prevent multiple instances, it is not a standard or commonly associated technique with the TTPs mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the related TTPs, it is less likely that the CopyKittens group would use a global mutex in this specific context.

**Final Answer: B: No**
