Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Korplug variant:
1. Collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
2. Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
3. Uses an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
4. Subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. However, it does not specifically mention a custom TCP-based protocol or initial HTTPS/TCP handshake.
  - **Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns more closely with the custom TCP-based protocol mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the custom TCP-based protocol and the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, which is consistent with the T1095 technique.
  - The subsequent encrypted communication over TCP also fits well with the T1095 technique, as it involves non-application layer protocols for C2.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that Korplug does not use a custom TCP-based protocol or an initial HTTPS/TCP handshake, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions involving a custom TCP-based protocol and an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1095, support the use of non-application layer protocols for C2, which aligns with the custom TCP-based protocol and the initial handshake.
- Answer Choice A is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
