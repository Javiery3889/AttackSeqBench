Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compromise a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
2. Use Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.
3. Determine if the GreyEnergy group is likely to use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to other systems to facilitate lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing LSASS memory to extract credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Nmap and Mimikatz**: These tools are used for network mapping and credential collection, which are part of the Credential Access tactic (T1003.001-LSASS Memory).
- **SysInternals PsExec and WinExe**: These tools are used for executing processes on remote systems, which is a common method for lateral movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer).

Given that the GreyEnergy group has already compromised a system and collected credentials, it is logical that they would use tools like PsExec and WinExe to move laterally across the network. These tools are specifically designed for this purpose and are commonly used by threat actors.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The GreyEnergy group has already compromised a system and collected credentials.
2. They have used Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and gather more credentials.
3. The next logical step in an attack sequence is to move laterally across the network.
4. Tools like PsExec and WinExe are well-known for facilitating this lateral movement.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the GreyEnergy group will indeed use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
