Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Credential dumping using a PowerShell script speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
2. Reading the memory of `lsass.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network's trust relationships.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to extract credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Dumping (Mimikatz)**: This is a common initial step in an attack to obtain credentials.
- **Reading LSASS Memory**: This is a technique to extract credentials from the LSASS process, which is a common follow-up to credential dumping.

Given these steps, the next logical actions would be to use the obtained credentials to further understand the network environment and potentially escalate privileges. This aligns with the Tactic of Discovery, specifically Domain Trust Discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Dumping**: The attackers have obtained credentials using Mimikatz.
2. **LSASS Memory Reading**: They have read the memory of `lsass.exe` to extract these credentials.
3. **System Fingerprinting**: This is a common next step to understand the network environment and identify potential targets.
4. **Domain Trust Discovery**: Using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` to discover domain trust relationships is a logical next step to understand the network topology and potential attack vectors.

Given this sequence, the attackers are likely to proceed with system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
