Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The malware achieves persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
2. The malware then performs process discovery to identify the explorer process.
3. Finally, the malware establishes command and control through Process Hollowing for communication with the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique is used to create a RunOnce key in the registry to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After achieving persistence, the malware would likely perform process discovery to identify a process that is critical for the system (like explorer.exe) to ensure it can establish a foothold.
  - Once the explorer process is identified, the malware can then use Process Hollowing to inject its malicious code into the explorer process, thereby establishing command and control through the C2 server.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the malware does not perform process discovery and directly uses Process Hollowing without identifying a specific process, it would be less effective in establishing a persistent and stealthy C2 channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common malware attack pattern.
- The malware first achieves persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
- It then performs process discovery to identify a critical process like explorer.exe.
- Finally, it uses Process Hollowing to inject its malicious code into the identified process, thereby establishing a stealthy C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A**
