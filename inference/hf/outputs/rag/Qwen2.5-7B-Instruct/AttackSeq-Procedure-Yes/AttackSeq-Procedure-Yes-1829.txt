Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Evading detection through overlay screens.
2. Installing a payload app.
3. Collecting files and screenshots.
4. Encrypting the collected data using RSA and AES.
5. Exfiltrating the data to a C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves collecting and archiving data from the target system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique aligns with the step of collecting files and screenshots.
- **Technique T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique aligns with the step of encrypting the collected data using RSA and AES.
- **Technique T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique is also related to evading detection, which is part of the initial evasion through overlay screens.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes collection, encryption, and exfiltration.
- The related TTPs support the collection and encryption steps.
- The question does not explicitly mention obfuscation, but it is a common technique used in conjunction with evasion.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the callCam app will indeed collect files and screenshots, encrypt this data using RSA and AES, and then exfiltrate it to the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
