Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
2. Delivery of DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
3. Deployment of an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware.
4. Execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This is the first step where the adversary gains entry into the target network. The question mentions password spraying or brute-force attacks, which are common methods for initial access.
- **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001)**: This is the technique used to deliver the DanBot malware via malicious Excel attachments. This aligns with the second step in the sequence.

Now, we need to evaluate the deployment of an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware and the execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

- **Obfuscation and Dropping Malware**: Obfuscating the macro tool (DanDrop) to avoid detection is a common tactic used by adversaries to ensure the malware (DanBot) is not easily detected by antivirus software or other security measures. This step is plausible and aligns with the TTPs of evading detection and maintaining access.
- **Execution via `cmd.exe`**: Once the malware is dropped, executing it via `cmd.exe` is a straightforward method to run the malware and perform the desired actions, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern.
- The use of an obfuscated macro tool (DanDrop) to drop the DanBot malware is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
- Executing the malware via `cmd.exe` is a standard method for running the malware and performing the desired actions.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the provided answer choices.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
