Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The backdoor program gathers host information.
2. It establishes communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling.
3. It parses the returned data.
4. It extracts commands from the C2 server.
5. It distributes these commands through the taskHandler function.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.004-DNS

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Host Information**: This is a common initial step in many attack sequences, often part of the reconnaissance phase.
- **Establishing Communication with C2 Server**: DNS tunneling is a technique used to exfiltrate data or establish command and control communication. T1071.004-DNS specifically mentions using DNS for C2 communication.
- **Parsing Returned Data**: This is a logical next step after establishing communication, where the data received from the C2 server is processed.
- **Extracting Commands**: After parsing the data, the next step would be to extract any commands or instructions from the data.
- **Distributing Commands through taskHandler Function**: This is a plausible final step where the extracted commands are executed or distributed within the compromised system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns well with the TTPs mentioned, particularly T1071.004-DNS, which involves using DNS for C2 communication.
- The steps of gathering information, establishing communication, parsing data, extracting commands, and distributing them through a taskHandler function are all logical and consistent with typical attack patterns.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
