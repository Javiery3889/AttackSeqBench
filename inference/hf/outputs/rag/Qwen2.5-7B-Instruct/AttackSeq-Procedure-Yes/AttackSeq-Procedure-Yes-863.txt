Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a modular malware framework is used to develop resources with functionality defined by uploaded modules. It then asks if GreyEnergy is likely to proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the host information gathering mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances**
  - This technique involves identifying and exploiting network security appliances, which is a form of reconnaissance but not directly related to the host information gathering mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's scenario of host information gathering, which is a form of collection. The related TTPs, particularly T1005, support this by indicating that GreyEnergy would gather data from the local system, which is consistent with the host information gathering mentioned.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the question's scenario. The related TTPs do not provide evidence that GreyEnergy would not proceed with host information gathering.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where GreyEnergy is likely to gather host information as part of their reconnaissance efforts.
- The related TTPs, specifically T1005, indicate that GreyEnergy would gather data from the local system, which is consistent with the host information gathering mentioned.
- The other related TTP (T1590.006) is more focused on network security appliances and does not directly support the host information gathering mentioned in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
