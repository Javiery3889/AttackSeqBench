Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction.
2. Stealing stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.

The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client system. This aligns with the initial step of exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection or to disrupt the system's normal operation, which is a form of defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.
  - Given that the campaign has already executed code silently and stolen credentials, it is plausible that the attackers might want to cover their tracks by deleting files to evade detection. This aligns with the T1070.004-File Deletion technique.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the campaign will not employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.
  - While it is possible that the attackers might not use file deletion, the question does not provide enough context to definitively rule out this technique. The attackers might have other motives or methods for defense evasion that are not specified in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are likely to be part of a sophisticated attack, including silent code execution and credential theft.
- The attackers might want to cover their tracks and evade detection, which is a common practice in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- The T1070.004-File Deletion technique is a plausible method for defense evasion in such a scenario.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
