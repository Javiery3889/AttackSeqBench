Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware (T9000) first evades detection by customizing its installation and using mutexes and named events to ensure only one instance runs.
   - The malware then captures data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft.
   - Finally, it communicates with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion:** This technique is about using mutual exclusion to ensure only one instance of the malware runs, which aligns with the question's description of using mutexes and named events.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using a non-application layer protocol for C2 communication, which aligns with the question's description of using an encrypted binary protocol for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to capture data from the victim's system and communicate with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol after evading detection.
   - The related TTPs confirm that the malware is capable of both capturing data (which includes Skype communications and file theft) and using a non-application layer protocol for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs, the malware is indeed likely to perform the actions described.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A: Yes"
