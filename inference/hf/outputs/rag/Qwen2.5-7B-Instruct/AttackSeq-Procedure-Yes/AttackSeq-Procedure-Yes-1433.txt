Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ProjectM actors gain initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files.
2. They then use domains to host C2 servers.
3. Andromeda Trojan delivers payloads from these C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is relevant to the initial access via malicious RTF and Excel files.
- **T1583.001-Domains**: This technique is relevant to the use of domains to host C2 servers.
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique is relevant to the delivery of the Andromeda Trojan.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if the sequence of TTPs in the question is plausible:
- **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)**: This is the first step where ProjectM actors gain access.
- **Use of Domains (T1583.001-Domains)**: After gaining access, the actors likely use domains to host C2 servers.
- **Delivery of Payloads (T1204.002-Malicious File)**: Finally, the Andromeda Trojan is delivered from these C2 servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The actors exploit vulnerabilities in RTF and Excel files to gain initial access.
2. **Use of Domains**: After gaining access, they use domains to host C2 servers, which is a common practice to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
3. **Delivery of Payloads**: The Andromeda Trojan is then delivered from these C2 servers to execute the payload.

Given this sequence, the answer choices are:
- **A: Yes**
- **B: No**

The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
