Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Carbanak group:
1. They used Cobalt Strike beacon for discovering and mapping the organization's internal network.
2. They then moved laterally across the infrastructure.
3. They targeted internal hosts and servers.
4. They prepared and collected documents related to internal applications and procedures.
5. They exfiltrated these documents.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This TTP involves moving from one system to another within the same network. It aligns with the question's mention of moving laterally across the infrastructure.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This TTP involves transferring data out of the network using a command and control (C2) channel. It aligns with the question's mention of exfiltrating documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After mapping the network, the group would likely move laterally to target internal hosts and servers, and then prepare and collect documents for exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the group did not move laterally and target internal hosts and servers, it would be less likely to prepare and collect documents for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Carbanak group's actions are consistent with the described sequence.
- They first map the network using Cobalt Strike.
- They then move laterally to target internal hosts and servers.
- They prepare and collect documents related to internal applications and procedures.
- Finally, they exfiltrate these documents.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
