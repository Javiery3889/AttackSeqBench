Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.
2. Exfiltrating these files at regular intervals.
3. Using a Tor hidden service for exfiltration.
4. Following up with SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the "exfiltration at regular intervals" part of the question.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for exfiltration, which could be relevant to using a Tor hidden service.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automated collection of data, which aligns with the "collecting files from application and data directories" part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions.
  - It mentions automated collection (T1119), automated exfiltration (T1020), and exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041), which could include using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions.
  - It would imply that Infamous Chisel does not perform the described actions, which contradicts the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve collecting data, exfiltrating it at regular intervals, and using a combination of Tor and SSH for exfiltration.
- The related TTPs support this sequence, particularly T1119 for collection, T1020 for automated exfiltration, and T1041 for exfiltration over a C2 channel, which could include Tor and SSH.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
