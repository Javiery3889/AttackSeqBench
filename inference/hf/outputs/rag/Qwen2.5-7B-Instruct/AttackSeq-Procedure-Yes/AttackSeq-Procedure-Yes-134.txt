Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT-TOCS:
1. Initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts.
2. Execution of Shellcode scripts in memory.
3. Core step of the attack.
4. Multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code. It aligns with the initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts.
- The question asks if the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack without being written to the hard disk. This aligns with the technique of executing code in memory (T1059.001-PowerShell) to avoid leaving traces on the disk.
- Multi-beacon communication (defense evasion) is a separate technique (T1136) that is mentioned in the question but is not directly related to the execution in memory.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts is consistent with T1059.001-PowerShell.
- Executing Shellcode scripts in memory without writing them to the hard disk is a common practice to avoid detection and persistence.
- Multi-beacon communication is a separate technique used for defense evasion, which is not directly related to the execution in memory.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Shellcode script functionalities were indeed executed in memory during the core step of the attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
