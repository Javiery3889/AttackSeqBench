Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
2. Using a backdoor to list interesting files such as Office documents during discovery.

The question then asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is part of the initial discovery phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.
  - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1039, it is plausible that the malware would indeed scan network shared drives for sensitive data as part of the data collection phase.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.
  - While it is possible that the malware might not perform this action, the related TTPs do not provide information to conclusively rule out this behavior.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that include persistence and discovery of Office documents.
- The related TTPs specifically mention collecting data from network shared drives (T1039) and discovering files and directories (T1083).
- Given the context of data collection and the mention of network shared drives, it is reasonable to infer that the malware might indeed scan these drives for sensitive data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
