Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Leveraging an open Weave Scope service to achieve initial access to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Executing a downloaded coin miner.
3. Setting the attributes of the coin miner to immutable.
4. Performing cryptocurrency mining.
5. Scanning IP ranges to identify additional open Docker API endpoints.
6. Deploying malware on these endpoints.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**: This technique involves using a system to perform unauthorized computations, such as cryptocurrency mining.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions leveraging an open Weave Scope service, which is a valid initial access technique.
- **Execution of Coin Miner**: The question states that a coin miner is downloaded and executed. This aligns with the T1610-Deploy Container technique.
- **Setting Attributes to Immutable**: This step is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs but could be a defensive measure to prevent the coin miner from being removed.
- **Cryptocurrency Mining**: This is a clear example of T1496.001-Compute Hijacking.
- **Scanning IP Ranges**: This is a reconnaissance activity to find additional targets, which is a common step in an attack.
- **Deploying Malware**: This is a continuation of the attack, deploying malware on identified targets.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. The initial access, execution of the coin miner, and cryptocurrency mining are all consistent with the techniques provided.
- The scanning for additional targets and deploying malware are also common and logical steps in an attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
