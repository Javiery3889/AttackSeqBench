Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that CosmicDuke has already targeted files on hard drives and network drives for discovery. It then asks if it is likely that the malware searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts, using techniques described under Data from Removable Media.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves the collection of data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices that can be used to exfiltrate or manipulate data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique directly relates to the question about searching removable drives for files. It is a logical next step after discovering and targeting files on hard drives and network drives.
- **Technique T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: While this technique is related to identifying peripheral devices, it does not directly address the collection of data from these devices. It is more about the discovery phase rather than the collection phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. CosmicDuke has already targeted files on hard drives and network drives, which falls under the Tactic of Discovery (T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery).
2. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to collect data from these devices, which aligns with the Tactic of Collection (T1025-Data from Removable Media).
3. Removable drives are a type of peripheral device that can be used to store and transfer data, making them a relevant target for data collection.

Given this reasoning, it is highly likely that CosmicDuke would search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
