Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.
2. Determining if SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor as part of the Impact tactic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and listing running processes, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1565.001-Stored Data Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying stored data, which could include modifying source code to inject a backdoor.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after discovering MsBuild.exe, the attacker (SUNSPOT) will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.
  - This aligns with the Impact tactic and the technique of modifying stored data (T1565.001-Stored Data Manipulation).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attacker will not modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.
  - This does not align with the Impact tactic and the technique of modifying stored data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attacker first discovers the running processes (MsBuild.exe) and then modifies the source code to inject a backdoor.
- The related TTPs confirm that modifying stored data (source code) is a technique used in the Impact tactic.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker will indeed modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

**Final Answer: A**
