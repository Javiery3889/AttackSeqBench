### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the lightSpy malware, including data collection from various sources such as hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.
   - The question then asks whether the malware is likely to use hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves the malware collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the data collection actions described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering and collecting information from browsers, which also aligns with the question's description.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves the malware collecting data from information repositories, which could include messenger app data as mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence of data collection actions, which are consistent with the related TTPs.
   - The question then asks about the use of hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration. This is a common TTP in malware operations, where the malware uses predefined C&C server locations to receive updates and exfiltrate data.
   - Given that the malware has already performed extensive data collection, it is logical that it would use a C&C server to manage updates and exfiltrate the collected data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
