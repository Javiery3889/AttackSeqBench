Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Discovery of files of interest using the `netd` component.
2. Collection of GPS information.
3. Deployment of `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic.
4. Exfiltration of files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves gathering information about the network environment, which aligns with the use of `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data through a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The use of `tcpdump` for network sniffing (T1040) and exfiltration through a Tor hidden service and SSH (T1041) are both mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the answer were "No," it would imply that the steps described in the question do not follow the typical attack pattern of the `Infamous Chisel` actor.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of activities that include network sniffing and exfiltration, which are directly related to the TTPs provided.
- The use of `tcpdump` for network sniffing (T1040) and exfiltration through a Tor hidden service and SSH (T1041) are both mentioned in the related TTPs.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the TTPs provided.

**Final Answer: Yes**
