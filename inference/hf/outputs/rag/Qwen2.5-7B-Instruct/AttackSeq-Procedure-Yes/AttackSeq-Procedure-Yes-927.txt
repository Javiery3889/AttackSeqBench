### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Volatile Cedar campaign has already used keylogging to extract administrator passwords from target servers.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the campaign will use a multi-tiered server backend framework, including static and dynamic update servers, for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is directly related to the keylogging capability mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which aligns with the concept of a multi-tiered server backend framework.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves bidirectional communication, which can be part of a multi-tiered server backend framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of using a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, directly support the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.
   - The bidirectional communication technique (T1102.002) can also be part of such a framework, but it is more about the nature of the communication rather than the structure of the backend.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the Volatile Cedar campaign has already demonstrated the capability to extract administrator passwords (a form of collection), and the related TTPs strongly support the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control, it is highly likely that the campaign would employ such a framework.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
