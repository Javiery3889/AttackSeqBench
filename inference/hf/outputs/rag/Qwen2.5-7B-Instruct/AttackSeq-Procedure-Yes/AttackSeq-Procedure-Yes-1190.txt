### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used the RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 server located in Germany using application layer protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically involving the use of web protocols for C2 communications.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of non-application layer protocols for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about application layer protocols, which aligns with T1071 and T1071.001.
   - The question does not mention any non-application layer protocols, which rules out T1095.
   - The context of the question (reconnaissance and lateral movement) is consistent with the use of C2 communications to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the question with the application layer protocols (T1071 and T1071.001) and the context of the attack sequence, it is plausible that the RMS executable would attempt to communicate with a C2 server using application layer protocols.

### Final Answer: A
