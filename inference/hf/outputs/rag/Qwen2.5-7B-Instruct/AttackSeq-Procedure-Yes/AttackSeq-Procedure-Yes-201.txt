Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial Access: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. Resource Development: Acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY.
3. Command and Scripting Interpreter: Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question already states that the initial access is achieved by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. This aligns with the T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application technique.
- **Resource Development**: The question asks if it is likely that the actor would acquire infrastructure for Resource Development after gaining initial access. This step is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a common follow-up step in many cyber attacks.
- **Command and Scripting Interpreter**: The question states that `cmd.exe` is used to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor. This is a plausible step after acquiring infrastructure, as it would allow the actor to execute commands and install malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question clearly states that the initial access is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities, which aligns with the T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application technique.
2. **Resource Development**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, acquiring infrastructure is a common step after gaining initial access. This step is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns.
3. **Command and Scripting Interpreter**: Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the backdoor is a plausible and common method, especially after acquiring infrastructure.

Given the logical sequence and the common attack patterns, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
