Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors, including developing custom toolsets, registering domains, and using WHOIS protection services.
   - It then asks if gathering victim identity information is likely as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique directly relates to the question, as it involves collecting information about potential victims.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique is related to gaining initial access through a web-based attack, but it does not directly address the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.002-WHOIS:** This technique involves using WHOIS services to gather information about domain registration, which is part of the reconnaissance phase but does not directly address gathering victim identity information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about gathering victim identity information, which is directly covered by the T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information technique.
   - The other techniques (T1189 and T1596.002) are related to different parts of the attack lifecycle but do not directly address the question at hand.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of gathering victim identity information as part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information, directly support the idea that this is a common and likely step in the reconnaissance phase.
   - The other techniques, while part of the overall attack lifecycle, do not directly address the specific question about gathering victim identity information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
