Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting data from the local system, stolen credentials are likely to be sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols before encrypting the data for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a compromised system. It does not specify the protocol used.
- **T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is symmetrically encrypted and not a C2 channel.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that stolen credentials are sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols before encryption.
  - However, the related TTPs do not directly support this sequence. T1041 specifically mentions exfiltration over a C2 channel, which is not necessarily a standard application layer protocol.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that stolen credentials are not sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols before encryption.
  - T1041, which is a relevant TTP, indicates that exfiltration over a C2 channel is a common technique. This does not necessarily mean that standard application layer protocols are used, but it does suggest that C2 channels are used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the use of standard application layer protocols, which are not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
- T1041, a relevant TTP, indicates that exfiltration over a C2 channel is a common technique, which is more aligned with the question's context.
- The related TTPs do not provide evidence that standard application layer protocols are used for exfiltration before encryption.

### Final Answer: B
