Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) to load a malicious `wab32res.dll` through a benign file during the Defense Evasion phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves using a legitimate DLL to load a malicious one, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` utility to execute a DLL, which is another method of DLL hijacking.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question does not directly mention the use of SSL for C&C communication. However, it is a common practice for malware to use encrypted channels (like SSL) to communicate with their Command and Control (C&C) servers to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
   - The related TTPs do not provide direct information about the use of SSL for C&C communication, but they do involve techniques that are often used in conjunction with C&C communication, such as DLL hijacking.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario involving DLL hijacking, which is a technique used to evade detection.
   - While the question does not explicitly mention SSL, it is a common practice for malware to use encrypted channels for C&C communication to avoid detection.
   - The related TTPs, while not directly related to SSL, involve techniques that are often used in conjunction with C&C communication.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common practice of using encrypted channels for C&C communication and the lack of information in the question that would suggest otherwise, it is plausible that TClient would use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
