### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious DLL is sideloaded to deploy malware and establish evasion.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org` during command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels for C2 communication, which can include domain generation algorithms (DGAs), hardcoded domains, or other methods.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves deploying malware by sideloading a malicious DLL, which is consistent with the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is the same as the persistence technique mentioned above, reinforcing the use of sideloading for evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions sideloading and evasion, which aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The question asks about C2 communication, and the related TTPs do not directly mention C2 communication but do suggest the use of multiple channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).
   - Given that the malware has established itself through sideloading and evasion, it is plausible that it would use a hardcoded or generated domain for C2 communication, such as `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org`.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the malware would indeed connect back to the specified domain for C2 communication.

Final Answer: A
