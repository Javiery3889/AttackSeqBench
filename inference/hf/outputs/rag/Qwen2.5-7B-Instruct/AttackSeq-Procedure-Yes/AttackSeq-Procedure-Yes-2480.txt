Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 are used to execute code on victim systems. It then asks whether it is likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control (C2) servers during the resource development phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a system. This is relevant to the initial phase of the attack.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves acquiring or registering domains for use in the attack infrastructure.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains**: This technique is similar to the previous one, also involving the acquisition or registration of domains.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's context, as it suggests that the attackers would likely acquire infrastructure such as domains to serve as C2 servers during the resource development phase.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1583.001-Domains and T1584.001-Domains, directly support this choice by indicating that attackers often acquire domains for their attack infrastructure.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the typical behavior of attackers, who often need a C2 infrastructure to maintain control over compromised systems. Acquiring domains is a common practice for establishing such infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the question involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain initial access to victim systems.
- The related TTPs, specifically T1583.001-Domains and T1584.001-Domains, indicate that attackers often acquire domains to establish C2 infrastructure.
- Acquiring domains is a standard practice for attackers to maintain control over compromised systems and to facilitate further attacks.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers would indeed acquire infrastructure such as domains to serve as C2 servers during the resource development phase.

**Final Answer: A**
