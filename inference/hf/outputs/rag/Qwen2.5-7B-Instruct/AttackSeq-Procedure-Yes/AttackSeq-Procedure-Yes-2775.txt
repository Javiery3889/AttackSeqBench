Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The use of self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence (Defense Evasion, T1070-Indicator Removal).
2. Gathering system information (Discovery).
3. Using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally among internal or external systems (Lateral Movement, T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal)**: This technique involves removing or misrepresenting information to avoid detection.
- **Lateral Movement (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol)**: This technique involves moving from one system to another using RDP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It suggests that the Dragonfly group used self-deleting code to evade detection, gathered system information to understand the network, and then used RDP to move laterally.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence of actions described in the question is not likely. However, the related TTPs support the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a logical sequence of actions that aligns with the Dragonfly group's known tactics.
- The related TTPs (Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement) support the sequence of actions described in the question.
- The Dragonfly group is known for using self-deleting code to evade detection, gathering system information to understand the network, and then moving laterally using RDP.

### Final Answer: Yes
