Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.
2. It then communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. HTTP POST requests are a form of web protocol.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel. While this is related, the question specifically asks about communication for command and control purposes, not necessarily data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This aligns with the TTPs provided. The technique T1071.001-Web Protocols directly mentions using web protocols (like HTTP POST) for command and control.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This does not align with the TTPs provided. There is no indication in the related TTPs that the Rising Sun implant would not use HTTP POST for command and control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the Rising Sun implant performs reconnaissance and then communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
- The related TTPs confirm that web protocols (including HTTP POST) are used for command and control.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant would indeed communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

**Final Answer: A**
