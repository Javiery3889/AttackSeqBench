Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Establishing command and control via HTTP requests.
2. Initiating the attack chain with a malicious document through phishing emails.
3. Executing VBS scripts.
4. Creating scheduled tasks for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This TTP is about creating scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This TTP is about using spearphishing links to gain initial access to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link)**: This TTP aligns with the first part of the question, where a malicious document is delivered through phishing emails.
- **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task)**: This TTP aligns with the last part of the question, where scheduled tasks are created for persistence.
- **Executing VBS scripts**: This step is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a common technique used in the attack chain.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions delivering a malicious document through phishing emails, which aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link TTP.
2. **Persistence**: The question mentions creating scheduled tasks for persistence, which aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task TTP.
3. **Command and Control**: The question mentions establishing command and control via HTTP requests, which is a common step after initial access and persistence.
4. **Executing VBS scripts**: While not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, VBS scripts are a common method for executing malicious code and maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
