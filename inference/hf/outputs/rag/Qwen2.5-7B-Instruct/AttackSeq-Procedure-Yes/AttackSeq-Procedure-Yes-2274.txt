Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Regin malware:
1. Injects files into services.exe.
2. Gathers information on processes and memory utilization.
3. Uses remote access Trojan capabilities to capture screenshots.
4. Crawls through the file system for data collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the process and memory utilization gathering.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves discovering information about the system, which aligns with the process and memory utilization gathering.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which aligns with the action of capturing screenshots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The malware first gathers information (processes and memory utilization) and then uses its remote access capabilities to capture screenshots and crawl through the file system for data collection.
  - The related TTPs (T1005, T1082, and T1113) support this sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the malware did not gather information on processes and memory utilization before employing its remote access capabilities, it would not follow the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of actions by Regin.
- The related TTPs support the sequence of gathering information before employing remote access capabilities.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) aligns with the described sequence and the supporting TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
