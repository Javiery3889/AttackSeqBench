Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.
2. CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions.
3. CloudMensis uses public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This technique is relevant to the first part of the question, where ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique is also relevant to the first part, as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities to evade security measures.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is relevant to the third part of the question, where public cloud storage services are used for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that CloudMensis will exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions, which aligns with the technique T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion.
  - It also implies that CloudMensis will use public cloud storage services for C2 communication, which aligns with the technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that CloudMensis will not exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions, which would mean that the technique T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion is not used.
  - It also implies that CloudMensis will not use public cloud storage services for C2 communication, which would mean that the technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is not used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology, which is a form of defense evasion.
- CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions, which is a specific form of defense evasion.
- After bypassing TCC restrictions, CloudMensis uses public cloud storage services for C2 communication, which is a technique for initial access.

Given the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that CloudMensis will indeed exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions and then use public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A**
