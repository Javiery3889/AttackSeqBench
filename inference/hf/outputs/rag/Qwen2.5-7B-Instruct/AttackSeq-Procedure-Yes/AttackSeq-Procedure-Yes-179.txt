### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities: enumerating data directories, performing IP scanning, and using the `netd` component.
   - It then asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to leverage its Command and Control (C2) capabilities, specifically mentioning SCP functionality, local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the IP scanning activity.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network connections, which aligns with the data directory enumeration.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network services, which could be related to the overall reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial activities (IP scanning, data directory enumeration) are part of the broader Discovery tactic.
   - Infamous Chisel is known to use various C2 techniques, including SCP, Socks, and SSH, which are mentioned in the question.
   - Given that the initial activities are reconnaissance and discovery, it is logical that the next step would be to establish a C2 channel to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the described activities and the known capabilities of Infamous Chisel, it is highly plausible that after the initial discovery activities, the malware would leverage its C2 capabilities to establish a secure communication channel.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Infamous Chisel would indeed use its C2 capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
