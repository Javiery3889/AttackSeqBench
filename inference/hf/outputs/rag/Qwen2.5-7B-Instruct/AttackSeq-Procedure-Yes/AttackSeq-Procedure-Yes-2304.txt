Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. **Account Discovery**: Using PsLogList to extract Windows Security Event Logs.
2. **Credential Dumping**: Executing Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz to dump credentials.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Moving to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**: This technique involves using tools like PsExec or WinRM to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to extract credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **PsLogList (T1003.001-LSASS Memory)**: This is a technique for credential access, which is part of the initial reconnaissance phase to gather information about the environment.
- **Mimikatz (T1003.001-LSASS Memory)**: This is also a technique for credential access, used to extract credentials from memory.
- **SMB, PsExec, WinRM (T1021.006-Windows Remote Management)**: These are techniques for lateral movement, which is the next step after gaining access to credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Account Discovery**: The adversary uses PsLogList to gather information about the environment, including potential credentials.
2. **Credential Dumping**: The adversary then uses Mimikatz to extract the credentials from the LSASS memory.
3. **Lateral Movement**: With the credentials in hand, the adversary can now use tools like PsExec or WinRM to move laterally to a domain controller.

Given this sequence, the adversary is likely to move laterally to a domain controller after gaining credentials, which aligns with the techniques described in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
