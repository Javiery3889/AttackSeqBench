Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Smooth Operator malware:
1. Establishing communication with C2 servers over HTTPS.
2. Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
3. Exfiltrating collected data via a HTTP GET request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the C2 channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will automatically exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request.
  - Given the related TTPs, the malware is already using HTTPS for C2 communication, which is a web protocol. It is plausible that the malware could use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration, as it is a common method for data exfiltration over C2 channels.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not automatically exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request.
  - While it is possible that the malware might use a different method, the related TTPs do not provide information that would rule out the use of a HTTP GET request for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is already using HTTPS for C2 communication, which is a web protocol.
- The related TTPs suggest that the malware can use the C2 channel for exfiltration.
- A HTTP GET request is a common method for data exfiltration over C2 channels, making it a plausible choice for the malware to use.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a HTTP GET request.

**Final Answer: A**
