Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving shellcode, LdrLoadDll, and a decrypted payload using AES-128 encryption.
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to hook its main function (DllMain) to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a DLL from an unexpected location to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions a decrypted payload using AES-128 encryption, which aligns with T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File.
   - The question also mentions LdrLoadDll, which is a technique for loading a DLL, which aligns with T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading.
   - Hooking the DllMain function to obfuscate its presence is a common technique in the defense evasion phase to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of AES-128 encryption (T1027.013) suggests that the malware is trying to evade detection by making the payload harder to analyze.
   - The loading of a DLL (T1574.002) suggests that the malware is trying to evade detection by using an unexpected method to load the payload.
   - Hooking the DllMain function (which is a common technique in the defense evasion phase) would further obfuscate the malware's presence and make it harder to detect.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the techniques involved, it is highly likely that the malware would hook its main function (DllMain) to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
