Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the actor "FamousSparrow":
1. Utilizing `cmd.exe` to execute `SparrowDoor` backdoor for Execution.
2. Collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.
3. Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution (T1003.001-LSASS Memory)**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the LSASS process, which is a common method for credential access. However, the question specifically mentions using a custom version of Mimikatz, which is a tool for credential access, not necessarily for LSASS memory.
- **Discovery (T1003-OS Credential Dumping)**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting system information and probing files.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Execution**: The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `SparrowDoor` is a form of execution, but it does not directly align with the specific TTPs provided.
2. **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files is a clear part of the Discovery phase, which is supported by the TTP `T1003-OS Credential Dumping`.
3. **Credential Access**: Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz is a form of Credential Access, which is supported by the TTP `T1003.001-LSASS Memory`.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the provided TTPs, particularly the Discovery and Credential Access phases. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
