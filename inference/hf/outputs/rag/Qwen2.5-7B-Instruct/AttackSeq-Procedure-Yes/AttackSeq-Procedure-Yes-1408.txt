Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals use phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and lock out the original account owners. It then asks whether the cybercriminals are likely to demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**: This technique involves the creation and use of social media accounts for malicious purposes.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts**: This technique involves compromising existing accounts to gain access to them.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique involves stealing financial information or assets.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts.
  - Given the related TTPs, the cybercriminals have already compromised the accounts (T1586-Compromise Accounts) and are now in a position to use them. Demanding ransom payments before using the accounts seems less likely because the cybercriminals have already gained access and control over the accounts.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals will not demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts.
  - This aligns better with the related TTPs, as the cybercriminals have already compromised the accounts and are likely to use them for further scams without needing to demand ransom.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The cybercriminals have already used phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and lock out the original account owners, indicating they have successfully compromised the accounts.
- The related TTPs show that the cybercriminals are focused on compromising and using these accounts for further malicious activities.
- Demanding ransom payments before using the compromised accounts would be counterproductive, as the cybercriminals have already gained access and control over the accounts.

**Final Answer: B**
