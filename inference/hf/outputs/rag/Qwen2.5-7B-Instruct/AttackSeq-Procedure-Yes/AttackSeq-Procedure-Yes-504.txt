Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the SombRAT backdoor during the Discovery phase of the CostaRicto Campaign. Specifically, it mentions that the backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery. The question then asks whether it is likely that the backdoor would communicate with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using protocols other than the intended ones to tunnel data, which can help evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS queries to exfiltrate data or to establish a C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate the answer choices based on the related TTPs:
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, as both T1572-Protocol Tunneling and T1071.004-DNS are techniques used in the Command and Control tactic. Using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP would be a plausible method for the SombRAT backdoor to establish a C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of protocol tunneling and DNS for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SombRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor is known to use sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- The related TTPs indicate that the backdoor can use protocol tunneling (T1572) and DNS (T1071.004) for C2 communication.
- These techniques are commonly used by advanced malware to establish covert C2 channels, making it highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor would use such methods.

### Final Answer: Yes
