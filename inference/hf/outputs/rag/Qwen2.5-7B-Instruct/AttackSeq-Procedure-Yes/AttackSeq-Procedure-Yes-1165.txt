### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial infection using a zero-day exploit and Plexor malware.
   - It then asks if Longhorn's tools are likely to follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves checking for user activity to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of Longhorn's tools following guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Longhorn's tools are likely to use techniques such as T1497.002 to avoid detection, which aligns with the question's requirement to avoid detection before performing discovery and collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the related TTPs include techniques for avoiding detection (T1497.002) and performing system discovery (T1083 and T1005), it is reasonable to conclude that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
