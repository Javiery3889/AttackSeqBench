Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
2. The question asks if it is likely that they removed all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Defense Evasion, T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection.
- **Defense Evasion, T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique involves removing indicators from tools to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique directly aligns with the action of removing all disk-resident tools, which would help in avoiding detection.
- **T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique involves removing indicators from tools, which might be a part of the broader strategy but does not necessarily imply the removal of all disk-resident tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the removal of all disk-resident tools, which is a clear action that aligns with T1070.004-File Deletion.
- T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools is a broader technique that might be used in conjunction with T1070.004, but it does not directly address the removal of all disk-resident tools.

Given the specific nature of the question and the direct alignment of T1070.004-File Deletion with the action of removing all disk-resident tools, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
