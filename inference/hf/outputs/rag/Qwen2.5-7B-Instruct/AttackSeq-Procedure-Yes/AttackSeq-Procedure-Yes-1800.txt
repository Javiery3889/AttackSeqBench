Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed the use of two different single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers. It then asks if it is likely that attackers launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
  - This technique involves the use of encryption or encoding to evade detection. The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files aligns with this technique.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**
  - This technique involves causing a denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on an endpoint or network. The question mentions DDoS attacks and the 'total failure' of Next Media's network, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers used the encoded configuration files (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File) to launch DDoS attacks (T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service) against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.
  - The use of encoded files to evade detection and then launching DDoS attacks fits the described scenario.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers did not use the encoded configuration files to launch DDoS attacks against the specified targets.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of encoded configuration files, which aligns with the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique.
- The question also mentions DDoS attacks and the 'total failure' of Next Media's network, which aligns with the T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service technique.
- The sequence of TTPs (encoding files to evade detection and then launching DDoS attacks) is a plausible and common tactic used by attackers.

### Final Answer: Yes
