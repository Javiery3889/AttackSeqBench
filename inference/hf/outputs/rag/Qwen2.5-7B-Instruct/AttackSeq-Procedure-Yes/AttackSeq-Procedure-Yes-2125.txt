Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Konni APT Group:
1. Gaining initial access through an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL.
2. Executing various VBScripts and batch files.
3. Scheduling the 'install.vbs' script to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat'.

The question asks if it is likely that 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' will execute scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat' as part of their attack sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the attack techniques used:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique is directly related to the scheduling of 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat'. This indicates that the group is using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
- **Technique T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique is related to the use of VBScripts, which aligns with the 'install.vbs' script mentioned in the question.

Given that the question asks if it is likely that 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' will execute scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat', we need to consider the typical behavior of APT groups and the techniques they use.

- **'resolve.dns'**: This is likely a script that resolves domain names, which could be part of the attack to ensure the group can communicate with their command and control (C2) servers.
- **'stopedge.bat'**: This script is mentioned in the question and is used to schedule the 'install.vbs' script. It is reasonable to assume that 'stopedge.bat' might also execute other scripts as part of the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the group gains initial access, uses VBScripts and batch files, and schedules tasks to maintain persistence.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of scheduled tasks and VBScripts.
- It is plausible that 'stopedge.bat' and 'install.vbs' would execute other scripts like 'resolve.dns' as part of the attack sequence to ensure persistence and maintain communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
