Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Korplug malware:
1. Collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
2. Collecting data from network shared drives.
3. Exfiltrating the data via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions taken by the malware:
- **T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from local systems, which also aligns with the first part of the question.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the third part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if the malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration after the described collection activities.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence of actions described in the question. After collecting data from local systems and removable media, and then from network shared drives, the malware would likely proceed to exfiltrate the data.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence of actions described in the question. If the malware is collecting data, it is reasonable to assume that it would proceed to exfiltrate the data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions: collecting data from local systems and removable media, then from network shared drives.
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions are part of the malware's behavior.
- The question asks if the malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration after these collection activities.
- The logical sequence of actions suggests that after collecting data, the malware would proceed to exfiltrate it.

### Final Answer: Yes
