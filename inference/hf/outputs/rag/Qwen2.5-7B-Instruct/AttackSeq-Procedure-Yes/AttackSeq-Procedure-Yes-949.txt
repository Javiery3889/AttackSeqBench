Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malware has completed the Collection phase by scanning for files and staging data for exfiltration. It then asks whether the data is likely to be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server becomes operational.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It suggests that data is sent to a C2 server for exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback channels for C2 communications. It implies that if the primary C2 channel is compromised or unavailable, the attacker will use a secondary or fallback channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before the fallback C&C server becomes operational.
  - Given the related TTPs, this aligns with the typical sequence where the primary C2 channel is used first, and if it fails, the fallback channel is used.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that data will not be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before the fallback C&C server becomes operational.
  - This does not align with the typical sequence of using the primary C2 channel first and then switching to a fallback channel if necessary.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware has completed the Collection phase and is preparing to exfiltrate data.
- The related TTPs indicate that the primary C2 channel is used first, and if it fails, a fallback channel is used.
- Therefore, it is logical that the data would be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before the fallback C&C server becomes operational.

**Final Answer: A**
