Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Privilege escalation using the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll`.
2. The shellcode contacts a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`.
3. The domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` is resolved to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to gain elevated privileges.
- **T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control over it.
- **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop (a method of communication where data is left in a hidden location) to resolve a domain name to an IP address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The sequence described in the question aligns with the TTPs:
    - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: The use of `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` for privilege escalation.
    - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: The domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` is resolved to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91`, which is consistent with the use of a dead drop resolver.
    - The C&C communication (`https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`) is a typical C&C interaction.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs. There is no indication that the sequence of actions described would not occur.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve privilege escalation, domain resolution, and C&C communication.
- The related TTPs support the use of dynamic-link library injection for privilege escalation and the use of a dead drop resolver for domain resolution.
- The C&C communication is a standard part of the attack sequence described.

**Final Answer: Yes**
