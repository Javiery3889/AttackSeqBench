Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compromised legitimate websites are used as C2 (Command and Control) servers.
2. The attacker confirms communication with the target device via a ping command.
3. The attacker attempts lateral movement using the `net use` command.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering internet connections to identify potential C2 servers or other network resources.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Ping Command**: The ping command is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network. It is often used to confirm that a target device is online and reachable.
- **Net Use Command**: The `net use` command is used to establish a connection to a network resource, typically a shared folder or printer. In the context of lateral movement, it is used to gain access to resources on other machines within the network.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Compromised Websites as C2 Servers**: The attacker uses compromised websites to establish a C2 channel. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Ping Command**: After establishing the C2 channel, the attacker would likely want to confirm that the target device is reachable and online. This is a logical step to ensure the C2 channel is functioning before proceeding with further actions.
3. **Net Use Command**: Once the attacker confirms the target device is reachable, they would then attempt to move laterally within the network. The `net use` command is a method to gain access to resources on other machines, which is a common technique in lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker would first confirm communication with the target device via a ping command before attempting lateral movement using the `net use` command.

Final Answer: A
