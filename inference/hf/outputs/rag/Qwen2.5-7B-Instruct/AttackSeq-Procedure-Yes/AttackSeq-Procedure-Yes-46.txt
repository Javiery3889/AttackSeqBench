Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails that lead to the execution of VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document. The specific file mentioned is 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a phishing email with a malicious link that, when clicked, redirects the user to a malicious website or downloads a malicious file.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a phishing email with a malicious attachment, such as a Word document, that contains the malicious payload.

Given the question mentions a "phishing email containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file," the relevant TTP is **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**. This technique aligns with the scenario where a malicious document is attached to a phishing email.

### Step 4: Determine the Sequence of TTPs
The sequence of TTPs in the question involves:
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access through a phishing email.
2. **Execution of VBS Macros**: After gaining access, the VBS macros are executed from the embedded Microsoft Word document.

Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: The phishing email contains the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
2. **Execution of VBS Macros**: The VBS macros are executed from the document.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the scenario described in the question. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
