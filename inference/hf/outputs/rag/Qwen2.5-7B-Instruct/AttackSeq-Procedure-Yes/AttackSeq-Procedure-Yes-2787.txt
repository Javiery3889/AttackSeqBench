Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The app collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
2. The app performs routines on the iOS device.
3. The app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP.
4. The app then uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a Command and Control (C2) channel. This is relevant to the exfiltration part of the question.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP, etc.) for Command and Control operations. This is relevant to the FTP upload part of the question.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted non-C2 protocol. This is relevant to the HTTP exfiltration part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It suggests that the app first exfiltrates data via HTTP (unencrypted and non-C2) and then uploads files via FTP (a file transfer protocol used for C2 operations).
  - The related TTPs support this sequence:
    - T1048.003 (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol) for HTTP exfiltration.
    - T1071.002 (File Transfer Protocols) for FTP uploads.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the app does not follow the described sequence. However, the related TTPs do not contradict this sequence; they support it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the app first exfiltrates data via HTTP and then uploads files via FTP.
- The related TTPs support this sequence:
  - T1048.003 supports the HTTP exfiltration.
  - T1071.002 supports the FTP file transfer.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
