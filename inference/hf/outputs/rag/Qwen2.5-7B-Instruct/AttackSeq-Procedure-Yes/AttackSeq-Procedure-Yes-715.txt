Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malicious documents were used to gain initial access.
2. The Sharpshooter downloader was injected into the memory of Word.
3. Shellcode in winword.exe resolved libraries and APIs.
4. The second-stage payload and a decoy document were downloaded.
5. The second-stage payload and decoy document were executed using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the execution phase:
- **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which aligns with the use of CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using a malicious file to execute code, which could be related to the second-stage payload and decoy document.
- **T1221-Template Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a template, which could be related to the initial access via malicious documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question.
  - The use of CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA() (T1106-Native API) is consistent with the execution phase.
  - The downloading of the second-stage payload and decoy document (T1204.002-Malicious File) is also consistent with the sequence.
  - The initial access via malicious documents (T1221-Template Injection) is consistent with the initial phase.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question.
  - There is no indication in the related TTPs that the sequence described is not plausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs.
- The use of native APIs (CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA()) is a common technique in the execution phase.
- The downloading of the second-stage payload and decoy document is a typical action in the execution phase.
- The initial access via malicious documents is a common technique in the initial access phase.

### Final Answer: Yes
