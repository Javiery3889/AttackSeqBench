Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Public-facing applications are exploited to upload webshells.
2. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is used for lateral movement.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be utilized to exfiltrate data to C2 (Command and Control) servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the attack techniques:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the initial exploitation of public-facing applications to upload webshells.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the question about exfiltrating data to C2 servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is likely to be used for exfiltrating data to C2 servers.
  - The 'IPsec Helper' is a backdoor that can be used for various purposes, including data exfiltration. Given that the question mentions exfiltration to C2 servers, this backdoor could be a plausible choice.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is unlikely to be used for exfiltrating data to C2 servers.
  - There is no direct information in the question or related TTPs that would indicate that the 'IPsec Helper' is not used for exfiltration. However, the question does not provide any specific evidence that it is used for this purpose.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence that involves data collection and exfiltration.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a known method for exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
- The related TTPs support the use of exfiltration techniques over C2 channels.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the use of the 'IPsec Helper' for exfiltrating data to C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A**
