Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
2. Fetching computer name and user name information.
3. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. This aligns with the final step of communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the internet connection status, which is not directly relevant to the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user, which aligns with the step of fetching computer name and user name information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Ensuring persistence (downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder) is a common initial step.
  - Fetching computer name and user name information (T1033-System Owner/User Discovery) is a typical discovery activity.
  - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a command and control activity.
  - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the Rising Sun implant does not perform the discovery activities and does not communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which contradicts the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question (ensuring persistence, fetching computer name and user name information, and communicating with control servers) aligns with the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs support the sequence of activities described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
