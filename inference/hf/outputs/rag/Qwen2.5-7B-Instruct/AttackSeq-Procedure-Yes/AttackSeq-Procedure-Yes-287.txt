Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
2. The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
3. The backdoor collects and uploads targeted file types (doc, docx, and pdf) to the same server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves the attacker collecting data from the local system. In this case, it aligns with the backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves the attacker exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This aligns with the backdoor uploading targeted files to the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor will ping the C2 server at regular intervals and then collect and upload targeted files.
  - This sequence aligns with the described actions in the question and the related TTPs. The backdoor stealing credentials (T1005) and then uploading files (T1041) over a C2 channel are both plausible and consistent with the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not ping the C2 server at regular intervals and will not collect and upload targeted files.
  - This does not align with the described sequence in the question and the related TTPs. If the backdoor is stealing credentials and uploading files, it is likely that it will also ping the C2 server at regular intervals to maintain communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials, which is a form of data collection (T1005).
- The backdoor then pings the C2 server at regular intervals, which is a form of maintaining communication (likely a part of the C2 channel).
- The backdoor collects and uploads targeted file types (doc, docx, and pdf) to the C2 server, which is a form of exfiltration (T1041).

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will indeed ping the C2 server at regular intervals and then collect and upload targeted files.

**Final Answer: A**
