Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Using RC4 cipher with the key "78563412" for encrypting C2 address strings.
2. Initiating communication with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.
3. Encrypting these HTTP POST requests with the RC4 cipher.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control (C2) communications. HTTP POST requests are a form of web protocol.
- **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption methods, such as RC4, to encrypt data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's sequence of TTPs. It involves using RC4 for encryption and HTTP POST for communication.
  - The related TTPs (T1071.001 and T1573.001) support this sequence, as they both involve web protocols and symmetric cryptography, respectively.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the malware does not use HTTP POST for communication or does not use RC4 for encryption, which is not supported by the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware uses RC4 for encrypting C2 address strings and then uses HTTP POST for communication, which is consistent with the related TTPs.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.
- Answer Choice B (No) contradicts the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
