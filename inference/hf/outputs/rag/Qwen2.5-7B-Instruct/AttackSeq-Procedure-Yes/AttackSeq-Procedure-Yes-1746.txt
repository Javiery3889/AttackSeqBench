Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by TG1021:
1. **Discovery Phase**: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to gather information.
2. **Lateral Movement Phase**: The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the Lateral Movement phase:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to the target system to maintain or enhance access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, specifically T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares, which involves accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
  - It also aligns with the technique of dropping a web shell (NodeIISWeb) to compromise additional servers, which is a common method in Lateral Movement.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described actions in the question and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes TG1021 performing reconnaissance using SharpHound and PowerSploit, which are tools commonly used for gathering information.
- The Lateral Movement phase involves accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB, which is a common method for moving laterally within a network.
- Dropping a web shell (NodeIISWeb) to compromise additional servers is a typical technique used in Lateral Movement to maintain access and spread the infection.

Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
