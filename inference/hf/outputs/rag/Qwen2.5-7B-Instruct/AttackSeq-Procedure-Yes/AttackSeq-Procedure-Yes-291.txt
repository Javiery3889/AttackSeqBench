### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a backdoor (Dropping Elephant) steals Google Chrome credentials and other data.
   - It then asks if the file-stealer module is likely to iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
     - This technique is about stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is relevant to the question about iterating through directories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The backdoor has already stolen credentials and other data, which suggests it has already collected some information.
   - The question asks if the file-stealer module will further collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the backdoor is capable of discovering and collecting data from the local system, including files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the backdoor is already stealing credentials and other data, and the related TTPs indicate the capability to discover and collect files, it is plausible that the file-stealer module would iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
