Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Turla has implemented file upload and download capabilities with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase. The question then asks whether Turla is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's mention of files from USB drives.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include recent files.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is relevant to the initial discovery phase but not directly to the collection phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the techniques T1025 and T1005, which are directly related to the collection of data from removable media and the local system, respectively.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs, as it does not support the collection of data from USB drives or recent files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes Turla's actions during the discovery phase and asks about its likely actions during the collection phase.
- The related TTPs provide techniques that are directly relevant to the collection of data from removable media (USB drives) and the local system (recent files).
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is supported by the related TTPs, as it aligns with the techniques T1025 and T1005, which are specifically about collecting data from removable media and the local system.
- Answer Choice B (No) does not align with the related TTPs and does not support the collection of recent files and files from USB drives.

### Final Answer: Final Answer: A
