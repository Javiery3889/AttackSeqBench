Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
2. Execution using process hollowing to evade detection.
3. Engagement in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1566-Phishing
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** T1055.012-Process Hollowing
- **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** T1055.012-Process Hollowing

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing):** This is the first step in the sequence, which is correctly described in the question.
- **Execution Using Process Hollowing (T1055.012-Process Hollowing):** This technique is used to evade detection by hiding malicious processes within legitimate ones. The question suggests that TDrop2 would use this technique after initial access.
- **Discovery Activities (Gathering System Information and Network Views):** These are the final steps in the sequence, which are also correctly described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.
- TDrop2, after gaining initial access via spear-phishing, would likely use process hollowing to execute the malware and evade detection.
- After successful execution, the malware would proceed to gather system information and network views, which are typical discovery activities.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
