Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware (Shellbot) gathers specific information about the infected host, such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed. The question then asks if, after this information gathering, the malware is likely to establish C&C (Command and Control) communication using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to find and identify information about the target environment.
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique specifically involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as hardware details and installed software.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Information**: The question mentions that the malware is gathering specific details about the host, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
- **C&C Communication**: The question then asks if the malware is likely to establish C&C communication using an IRC channel after gathering this information.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Context of Shellbot**: Shellbot is a type of malware that is known to use IRC channels for C&C communication. This is a common method for malware to maintain persistence and receive commands from the attacker.
- **Information Gathering**: The detailed information gathering (processor cores, type of processor, and monitoring tools) is a typical behavior of malware that aims to understand the environment before establishing C&C communication. This information can be used to evade detection or to tailor the C&C communication to avoid common security measures.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after gathering the necessary information, the malware is likely to establish C&C communication using an IRC channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
