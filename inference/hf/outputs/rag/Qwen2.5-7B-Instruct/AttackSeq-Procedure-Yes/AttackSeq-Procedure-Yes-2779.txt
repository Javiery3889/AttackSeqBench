Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an actor-controlled Gmail account impersonated a prominent Israeli physicist. The next step in the sequence is to determine if the phishing emails included a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain, which then presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing email with a link to gain initial access to a system.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing email with a link to gather information about the target.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the phishing emails included a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain, which then presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.
  - This aligns with the TTPs provided, particularly T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which involves using a spearphishing email with a link to gain initial access.
  - The subsequent step of presenting a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials is a common technique used in spearphishing campaigns to steal credentials.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the phishing emails did not include a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain, which then presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.
  - This does not align with the TTPs provided, as it does not follow the sequence of gaining initial access through a spearphishing link and then using a forged login page to steal credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the actor-controlled Gmail account impersonated a prominent Israeli physicist, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- The next step is likely to be gaining initial access, which is typically done through a spearphishing email with a link to a controlled domain.
- The final step is to present a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials, which is a common technique in spearphishing campaigns.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
