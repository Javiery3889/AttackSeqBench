Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
2. Executing the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.
3. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the `dllhost.exe` process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** and **Tactic: Defense Evasion** are both relevant to the question, but the specific technique mentioned (T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection) is crucial.
- The technique T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection involves injecting a DLL into a process to execute arbitrary code. This aligns with the question's description of injecting a malicious DLL into `dllhost.exe`.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves multiple steps:
  1. Exploiting Equation Editor to execute an installer.
  2. Using the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.
  3. Injecting a malicious DLL into `dllhost.exe`.

- The FakeRun loader (T1055.001) is a known technique used to bypass security measures and execute code in a trusted process like `dllhost.exe`. This aligns with the tactic of Defense Evasion.
- The injection of a malicious DLL into `dllhost.exe` is a form of Dynamic-link Library Injection, which is a common technique for privilege escalation and maintaining persistence.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed the one described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
