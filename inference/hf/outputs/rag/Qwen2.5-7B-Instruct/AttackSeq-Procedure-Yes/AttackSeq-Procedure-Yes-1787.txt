Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the OceanLotus Group will perform the following sequence of actions:
1. Lateral movement using stolen credentials.
2. Leveraging Windows built-in tools.
3. Establishing command-and-control communication through HTTP and DNS Tunneling.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement Using Stolen Credentials**: This is a common technique used by APT groups to move laterally within a network. OceanLotus, being a known APT group, is likely to use stolen credentials for this purpose.
- **Leveraging Windows Built-in Tools**: OceanLotus, like many APT groups, often uses native tools available on the target system to avoid detection. Windows built-in tools are a common choice for this.
- **Establishing Command-and-Control Communication Through HTTP and DNS Tunneling**: The related TTPs mention T1572-Protocol Tunneling and T1071.004-DNS, which are techniques used to establish C2 communication. DNS Tunneling is a specific method of T1071.004-DNS, which is a plausible method for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Lateral Movement Using Stolen Credentials**: This is a common and effective method for APT groups to move within a network.
2. **Leveraging Windows Built-in Tools**: OceanLotus is known to use native tools for their operations to avoid detection.
3. **Establishing Command-and-Control Communication Through HTTP and DNS Tunneling**: The related TTPs specifically mention DNS Tunneling, which is a plausible method for C2 communication.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known tactics and techniques of the OceanLotus Group.

### Final Answer: A
