Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Welcome Chat app:
1. Ensures persistence by auto-starting at device boot through the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.
2. Collects device information and GPS location for discovery.
3. Uploads exfiltrated data to its C&C server using the HTTP protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration. The C2 channel is typically used to communicate between the attacker's infrastructure and the compromised system.

Given the context of the question, the app is described as uploading exfiltrated data to its C&C server. This aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique, which is a common method for data exfiltration in cyber attacks.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The app ensures persistence by auto-starting at device boot, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. It collects device information and GPS location, which are typical data points that attackers might want to exfiltrate.
3. The question asks if the app uploads exfiltrated data to its C&C server using the HTTP protocol. This is a plausible method for data exfiltration, as HTTP is a widely used protocol for web traffic and can be easily monitored and used for data transfer.
4. The related TTPs, specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, support the idea that the app is using a C2 channel for data exfiltration, which aligns with the HTTP protocol being used for this purpose.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
