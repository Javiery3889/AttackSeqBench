Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives.
2. Archiving the data locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.
3. Using proxies for communication and command and control.
4. Exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from local systems.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over alternative protocols.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the use of proxies for command and control and exfiltration over web services.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that FIN13 does not use proxies for command and control and does not exfiltrate data over web services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes the use of proxies for command and control and exfiltration over web services.
- The related TTPs support this sequence:
  - T1071.001-Web Protocols (Command and Control) supports the use of web protocols for command and control.
  - T1005-Data from Local System supports the collection of data from local systems.
  - T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol supports exfiltration over alternative protocols, which can include web services.

Given the alignment of the question with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
