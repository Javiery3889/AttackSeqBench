Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by CosmicDuke:
1. Using document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening malicious PDF files.
2. Executing malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
3. Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
4. Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates that the malware is designed to automatically exfiltrate data to remote servers.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This indicates that the malware is designed to capture keystrokes, which is a form of information collection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It mentions keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing, which are all forms of information collection (T1056.001-Keylogging). Additionally, it mentions exfiltration via FTP and WebDav, which is consistent with the T1020-Automated Exfiltration technique.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If CosmicDuke is not collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing, it would contradict the detailed sequence provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a detailed sequence of actions, including information collection and exfiltration.
- The related TTPs confirm that keylogging (T1056.001) and automated exfiltration (T1020) are indeed part of the attack sequence.
- Answer Choice A is consistent with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
