Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' which installs malware components.
2. Setting registry key values for persistence.
3. Utilizing port 55555 for file exfiltration.
4. Utilizing port 55556 for command and control communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding entries to the Windows Registry to ensure the malware starts with the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe'**: This is a common initial step in many malware infections, where the malware drops and executes a payload.
- **Setting registry key values for persistence**: This aligns with the T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder technique, which is a method to ensure the malware persists across reboots.
- **Utilizing port 55555 for file exfiltration**: This aligns with the T1571-Non-Standard Port technique, which is used to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
- **Utilizing port 55556 for command and control communication**: This also aligns with the T1571-Non-Standard Port technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' is a common initial step in malware infection.
2. Setting registry key values for persistence is a method to ensure the malware remains active, which aligns with T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.
3. Utilizing port 55555 for file exfiltration and port 55556 for command and control communication are both non-standard port techniques to evade detection, which align with T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Given the sequence described in the question and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed the one described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
