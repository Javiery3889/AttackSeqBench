Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have already:
1. Discovered and mapped the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacon.
2. Collected administrative-level credentials.

The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will:
- Move laterally across the infrastructure.
- Compromise numerous workstations.
- Target internal hosts and servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access to the network. This is consistent with the scenario where administrative-level credentials have been collected.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools across the network to maintain persistence and move laterally.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the scenario described in the question. After gaining initial access and collecting credentials, the attackers would likely move laterally to compromise other workstations and internal hosts and servers.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, support the idea of moving laterally across the infrastructure.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the scenario. If the attackers have already gained administrative-level credentials and mapped the network, it is highly likely that they would move laterally to compromise other systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already gained initial access and collected administrative credentials.
- The tactic of lateral movement is a common and expected next step after gaining initial access.
- The related TTPs, specifically T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, support the idea of moving laterally across the infrastructure.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will indeed move laterally across the infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A**
