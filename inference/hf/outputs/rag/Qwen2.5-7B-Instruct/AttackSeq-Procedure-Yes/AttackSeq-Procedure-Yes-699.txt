Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where zero-day exploits are used in conjunction with watering hole attacks to gain initial access to a network. It then asks whether the attackers, specifically those associated with the Elderwood Project, are likely to establish command and control (C&C) servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols to establish and maintain C&C communications.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web-based attack, which aligns with the watering hole attack mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel for C&C.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are likely to use web protocols (T1071.001) and bidirectional communication (T1102.002) to establish and maintain C&C servers.
  - The use of zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks to gain initial access (T1189) suggests a sophisticated and persistent threat actor, which is consistent with the Elderwood Project's known tactics.
  - Establishing C&C servers is a standard practice for maintaining control over compromised systems and retrieving commands, which aligns with the described scenario.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - There is no direct evidence in the related TTPs that suggests the attackers would not establish C&C servers.
  - The described attack sequence and the nature of the Elderwood Project's known tactics strongly imply that C&C servers would be established.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sophisticated attack sequence involving zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks, which are consistent with the Elderwood Project's known tactics.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are likely to use web protocols and bidirectional communication to establish and maintain C&C servers.
- Establishing C&C servers is a standard practice for maintaining control over compromised systems and retrieving commands, which aligns with the described scenario.

**Final Answer: A**
