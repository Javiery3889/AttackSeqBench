Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded encoded PowerShell scripts.
2. Execution of these scripts through macro-triggered events.
3. Use of decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence.
4. Employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the use of encoded PowerShell scripts.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection, which aligns with the final step of the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the step of using decoded scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence and then employ obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.
  - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs:
    - T1059.001-PowerShell for the initial use of encoded PowerShell scripts.
    - T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information for the use of decoded scripts.
    - T1027.010-Command Obfuscation for the final step of obfuscating the backdoor payload.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the campaign will not use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence and will not employ obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes the use of encoded PowerShell scripts, decoding them to drop persistence components, and then obfuscating the backdoor payload.
- The related TTPs support this sequence with techniques for PowerShell execution, deobfuscation, and command obfuscation.
- Answer Choice A aligns perfectly with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
