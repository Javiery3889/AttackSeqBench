Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The use of the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell.
2. Execution of encoded commands via PowerShell.
3. Contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1083)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing, operating, and maintaining the means by which an adversary can direct the actions of compromised systems.
- **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple channels to communicate with the command and control server, which is a common tactic in multi-stage operations.
- **Tactic: Execution (T1059)**: This tactic involves the adversary executing code or commands on the target system.
- **Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**: This technique involves the use of DDE to execute code, which aligns with the initial step in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. The use of DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands is a common initial step in a multi-stage attack. Contacting a control server to distribute malware is a typical follow-up action in such operations.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence. If the attack sequence is as described, it is highly likely that the malicious document would contact a control server to distribute the malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where DDE is used to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands. This is a common initial step in a multi-stage attack.
- The next logical step in such an attack would be to contact a control server to distribute the first-stage malware, which is a typical behavior in multi-stage command and control operations.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, support the idea of a multi-stage operation where the initial infection vector (DDE) is used to establish a foothold, and then the control server is contacted to distribute the malware.

### Final Answer: Yes
