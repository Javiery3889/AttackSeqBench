Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malware (Aumlib) evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques.
2. The malware then downloads an updated sample from specific URLs.
3. The malware shares code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control activity.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique involves removing indicators from tools to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique aligns with the first part of the question where Aumlib evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique aligns with the second part of the question where the malware downloads an updated sample from specific URLs.

However, the question also mentions that the malware shares code with an older variant, which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs. This suggests that the malware might be using a different TTP for sharing code, such as T1071.002-Exfiltration over C2 Channels, but this is not provided in the list.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes evasion and command and control activities.
- The related TTPs cover evasion (T1027.005) and command and control (T1071.001).
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will share code with an older variant, which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs.
- Given the options, the question is asking for a likelihood based on the provided TTPs.

Since the question is asking for a likelihood and the provided TTPs cover the evasion and command and control aspects, it is reasonable to infer that the malware might indeed share code with an older variant as part of the command and control activity, even though this is not explicitly covered by the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
