Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Trojanized KeePass binaries are used to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.
2. The next step is to determine whether FIN13 is likely to employ network sniffing to obtain credentials.
3. If network sniffing is employed, the next steps are to leverage native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to discover information.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique is used to capture credentials from network traffic.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique involves altering the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique is directly related to capturing credentials from network traffic, which aligns with the question's description of obtaining credentials.
- **T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique is more about altering the authentication process, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Action**: Trojanized KeePass binaries are used to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation. This is a method to capture credentials.
2. **Next Step**: The question asks if network sniffing is likely to be employed to obtain credentials. Given the related TTPs, T1040-Network Sniffing is a relevant technique for this purpose.
3. **Subsequent Actions**: After obtaining credentials through network sniffing, the next steps would be to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance. This aligns with the use of native OS binaries and custom malware, which are also mentioned in the related TTPs.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to use network sniffing to obtain credentials, followed by gathering network and host configuration details.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
