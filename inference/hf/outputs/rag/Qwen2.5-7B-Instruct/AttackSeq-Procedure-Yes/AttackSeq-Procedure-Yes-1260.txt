### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions after leveraging Discord CDNs to host a subsequent stage script.
   - The actions in the sequence are:
     1. Executing a PowerShell script.
     2. Loading a DLL containing an AMSI bypass method.
     3. Creating a registry key.
     4. Establishing persistence via a VBScript placed in the Startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders.
   - **T1218.010-Regsvr32 (Technique):** This technique involves using the `Regsvr32` command to load a DLL, which can be used for various purposes, including AMSI bypass.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** This tactic involves techniques used to maintain access to the target system.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (Technique):** This technique involves creating registry keys or placing files in the Startup folder to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Script (T1059.003):** This is a common technique used to execute scripts and can be used to load a DLL.
   - **Loading a DLL with AMSI Bypass (T1218.010-Regsvr32):** This is a specific technique that aligns with the question's requirement to bypass AMSI.
   - **Creating a Registry Key (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):** This is a persistence technique that aligns with the question's requirement to establish persistence.
   - **VBScript in Startup Folder (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):** This is another persistence technique that aligns with the question's requirement to establish persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs, particularly the techniques for AMSI bypass and persistence.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Blind Eagle would follow this sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
