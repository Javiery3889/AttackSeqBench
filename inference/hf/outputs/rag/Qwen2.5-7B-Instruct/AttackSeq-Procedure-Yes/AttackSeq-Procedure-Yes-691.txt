Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Pierogi backdoor:
1. Collects information about the infected machine, including the username and antivirus name.
2. Captures screenshots.
3. Executes arbitrary commands.
4. Communicates with C2 servers using predefined URLs for data upload and command reception.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves the automated collection of data from the target system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique aligns with the first part of the sequence, where the backdoor collects information about the infected machine.
- **Technique T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique aligns with the second part of the sequence, where the backdoor captures screenshots.

The question also mentions executing arbitrary commands and communicating with C2 servers, which are not directly covered by the provided related TTPs. However, these actions are common in the context of backdoor operations and can be inferred as part of the overall attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor first collects information (aligned with T1119-Automated Collection).
- It then captures screenshots (aligned with T1113-Screen Capture).
- The backdoor can also execute arbitrary commands and communicate with C2 servers, which are standard operations for a backdoor.

Given the provided related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed the one that includes capturing screenshots and executing arbitrary commands.

### Final Answer: A
