Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a keylogger is used to capture keystrokes, leading to the acquisition of additional accounts through Credential Access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Rocket Kitten (a known threat actor) will establish communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server to download malware or monitor the victim's communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the threat actor gaining access to user credentials.
   - **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** - This technique specifically refers to the use of keyloggers to capture keystrokes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that Rocket Kitten is known for its sophisticated cyber-attacks, it is highly likely that after gaining access to additional accounts through keylogging, the threat actor would establish communication with a C&C server.
     - Establishing communication with a C&C server allows the threat actor to further control the compromised system, download additional malware, or monitor the victim's communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice seems less plausible because it contradicts the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like Rocket Kitten, who often use keylogging to gain access and then leverage that access to perform more malicious activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Rocket Kitten would indeed establish communication with a C&C server to download malware or monitor the victim's communications.
   - Final Answer: A
