Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by RIG EK:
1. Using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
2. Obtaining capabilities.
3. Delivering exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising.
4. Redirecting users to its landing page.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising**: This technique involves the use of malvertising to deliver malicious content.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves the use of malicious links to execute code or redirect users.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a drive-by download, which can be facilitated by malvertising or malicious links.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1583.008-Malvertising, which involves using malvertising to deliver malicious content.
  - It also aligns with T1204.001-Malicious Link, which involves redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - The sequence described in the question (using vulnerabilities, obtaining capabilities, and then using malvertising to redirect users) fits well with the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of malvertising and malicious links as described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands and then uses malvertising to redirect users to its landing page.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of malvertising (T1583.008) and malicious links (T1204.001) as part of the attack sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: A
