Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initial reconnaissance (gathering system and network information).
2. Communication with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4.
3. Exfiltration of data obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to make it harder for defenders to understand the data.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating data that has been encoded or obfuscated.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question:
    1. Initial reconnaissance (which is part of the initial compromise and is not explicitly listed as a TTP but is a common first step).
    2. Communication with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 (T1132.001-Standard Encoding).
    3. Exfiltration of data obfuscated with Base64 encoding (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the Rising Sun implant does not use encryption or obfuscation, which contradicts the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes both encryption (RC4) and obfuscation (Base64 encoding), which are both techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1132.001-Standard Encoding for encryption and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information for obfuscation.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
