Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the spyware first extracts Chrome passwords by querying SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the spyware will perform keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe` after this initial action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Credential Access" and "Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers."
   - T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers is a technique that involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the initial action of extracting Chrome passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The initial action of extracting Chrome passwords is a form of Credential Access.
   - Keylogging (which is a form of Collection) is a different technique and is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - The related TTPs do not provide any information about keylogging or `libCache32.exe`.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of actions, starting with extracting Chrome passwords and then asking if keylogging is likely to follow.
   - The related TTPs only provide information about extracting credentials from web browsers, which is the initial action.
   - There is no information in the related TTPs that suggests keylogging or the use of `libCache32.exe` as a subsequent action.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the lack of information in the related TTPs about keylogging or `libCache32.exe`, and the fact that the question is asking about a sequence of actions, it is not likely that keylogging would follow the initial action of extracting Chrome passwords.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that keylogging is not likely to occur as a subsequent action.

Final Answer: B: No
