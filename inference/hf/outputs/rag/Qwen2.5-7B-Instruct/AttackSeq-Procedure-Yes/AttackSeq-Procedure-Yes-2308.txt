Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an adversary's actions after identifying privileged users using the PsLogList tool. It asks whether the adversary is likely to collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection**: This TTP is directly related to the collection of email messages.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This TTP is about discovering system time, which is not directly related to the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This TTP specifically mentions the collection of local email messages.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the TTPs related to the collection of email messages. The question mentions both local and remote systems, and the related TTPs include the collection of local email messages (T1114.001-Local Email Collection).
  - However, the question does not explicitly mention remote email collection, and the related TTPs do not include a specific technique for remote email collection.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the TTPs related to the collection of email messages. The question and the related TTPs suggest that the adversary is likely to collect email messages, even if not explicitly mentioning remote systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question indicates that the adversary has already identified privileged users and is likely to engage in collection activities.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1114-Email Collection and T1114.001-Local Email Collection, suggest that the adversary is indeed likely to collect email messages.
- While the question does not explicitly mention remote email collection, the context of collection activities and the related TTPs strongly suggest that the adversary would likely collect email messages from both local and remote systems.

### Final Answer: A
