Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Carbanak group:
1. Conducting reconnaissance on banking applications and internal procedures.
2. Using spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
3. Downloading a Cobalt Strike beacon component to gain initial access.
4. Executing arbitrary payloads, running shell commands, and deleting files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
  - This TTP involves using spear-phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
  - This TTP involves executing code or scripts to perform actions on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The Carbanak group is known for using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access and then using Cobalt Strike for further actions.
  - The TTPs provided (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link for Initial Access and T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange for Execution) support the actions described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. The Carbanak group's known tactics do involve spear-phishing and Cobalt Strike for initial access and further actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Carbanak group is known for using sophisticated methods to gain initial access and then perform various actions on the target system.
- The TTPs provided (spear-phishing and Cobalt Strike) are consistent with the actions described in the question.
- The sequence of actions (reconnaissance, spear-phishing, gaining initial access, executing payloads, and deleting files) is a typical sequence used by the Carbanak group.

**Final Answer: Yes**
