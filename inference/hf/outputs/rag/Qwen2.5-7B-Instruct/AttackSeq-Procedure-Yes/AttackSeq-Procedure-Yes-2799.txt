Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Grandoreiro ensures persistence by creating a `.LNK` file in the Windows startup directory.
2. It then discovers system information such as the operating system version.
3. Finally, it communicates with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to ensure persistence.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves placing entries in the Windows registry or startup folder to ensure persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The question mentions that Grandoreiro ensures persistence by creating a `.LNK` file in the Windows startup directory. This aligns with the T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder technique.
- **Discovering System Information**: The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will discover system information such as the operating system version. This step is not directly covered by the related TTPs, but it is a common practice in malware to gather system information before further actions.
- **Communicating with C&C Server**: The question states that Grandoreiro communicates with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands. This is a common TTP in malware operations.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The `.LNK` file in the startup directory ensures persistence, which aligns with T1547.001.
2. **Discovering System Information**: While not explicitly covered by the related TTPs, it is a common practice for malware to gather system information before further actions. This step is plausible and logical.
3. **Communicating with C&C Server**: The use of the RealThinClient SDK to communicate with the C&C server is a common TTP in malware operations.

Given the sequence described in the question and the common practices in malware operations, it is reasonable to assume that Grandoreiro would gather system information before communicating with the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
