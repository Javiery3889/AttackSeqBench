Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Grandoreiro is likely to employ techniques to steal credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic**: Credential Access
- **Technique**: T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique specifically targets credentials stored in web browsers. Google Chrome is a web browser, so this technique would be relevant for stealing credentials from Google Chrome.
- The question also mentions Microsoft Outlook, which is an email client and not a web browser. The related TTPs do not mention any techniques for stealing credentials from email clients like Microsoft Outlook.
- The question states that Grandoreiro has already collected information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software. This information could be used to tailor the attack, but it does not directly influence the choice of TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs specifically mention stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the question's mention of Google Chrome.
- There is no mention of any TTPs related to stealing credentials from Microsoft Outlook.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is focused on stealing credentials from Google Chrome, which is a web browser.

### Final Answer: A
