Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The malware uses `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information.
2. The gathered information is sent to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control server before contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**
  - This TTP involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) for command and control communications.
- **Tactic: Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery)**
  - This TTP involves gathering information about the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control server (`45.124.132.127`) before contacting the domain `marina-info.net`.
  - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the malware would use HTTPS for secure communication with the command and control server. This aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.
  - After establishing a secure connection, the malware might then proceed to contact the domain `marina-info.net` for further instructions.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control server before contacting `marina-info.net`.
  - This is less plausible because using HTTPS for command and control communications is a common and secure practice. It is less likely that the malware would skip this step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware first gathers system information using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.
- The gathered information is sent to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.
- Establishing an HTTPS communication with the command and control server (`45.124.132.127`) is a common and secure practice for malware to ensure the communication is encrypted and secure.
- After establishing the secure connection, the malware is likely to proceed to contact the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

### Final Answer: A
