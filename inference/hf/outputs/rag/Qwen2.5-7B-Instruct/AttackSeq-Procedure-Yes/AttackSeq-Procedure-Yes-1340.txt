Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a Flash zero-day exploit is used to gain arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, which then executes a second stage shellcode. The question asks whether it is likely that the second stage shellcode will then download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves using a vulnerability to execute code on a client system. This aligns with the initial Flash zero-day exploit.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain persistence and evade detection. This is relevant to the scenario where the second stage shellcode might download a final payload and establish communication with C2 servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of malware that uses multi-stage infection. After gaining initial access, the malware often downloads additional components (like the final payload, FinSpy) and establishes a communication channel with the C2 server to receive further instructions.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the second stage shellcode does not download the final payload or establish communication with C2 servers, which is less common in typical malware behavior.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial Flash zero-day exploit (T1203) provides the initial foothold on the system.
- The second stage shellcode, which is likely a more sophisticated piece of malware, would then proceed to download the final payload (FinSpy) to perform its malicious activities.
- Establishing communication with C2 servers (T1104) is a common practice to receive further instructions, update the malware, or exfiltrate data.

Given the typical behavior of malware and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the second stage shellcode will indeed download the final payload and establish communication with C2 servers.

### Final Answer: A
