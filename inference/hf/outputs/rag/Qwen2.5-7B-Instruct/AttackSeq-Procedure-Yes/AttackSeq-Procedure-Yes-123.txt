Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.
2. Recon information is sent or files are downloaded.
3. Agrius (a known threat actor) is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper.
4. The 'Apostle' wiper initially fails execution.
5. 'DEADWOOD' malware is deployed to overwrite files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique is about data destruction, which aligns with the question's focus on data destruction activities.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files, which is a form of data destruction.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - 'Apostle' wiper: This is a known wiper that can be used for data destruction.
  - 'DEADWOOD' malware: This is another piece of malware that can be used to overwrite files, which is also a form of data destruction.
  - The sequence described in the question aligns with the techniques of data destruction (T1485) and file deletion (T1070.004).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the sequence described in the question does not align with the known TTPs of Agrius or the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that align with known data destruction techniques.
- 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are both known to be used for data destruction.
- The sequence described in the question fits well with the related TTPs of data destruction and file deletion.

### Final Answer: Yes
