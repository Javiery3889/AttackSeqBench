Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after performing process and system information discovery, the SombRAT backdoor is likely to use proxy tools (pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY) to implement protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for communication with C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves the use of proxy tools to route traffic through a proxy server, which can help in evading network security measures.
  - **Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1090-Proxy**: This technique is directly related to the use of proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy and GO SOCKS5 proxy. These tools are used to route traffic through a proxy server, which can help in evading network security measures.
- **Technique T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another, such as tunneling DNS or HTTP traffic. This can be used to bypass network security controls and make the traffic appear as legitimate traffic.

Given that the SombRAT backdoor is performing process and system information discovery, it is likely that it would use these techniques to communicate with C2 servers. The use of proxy tools and protocol tunneling can help the malware evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SombRAT backdoor is performing discovery activities, which are common in the early stages of an attack.
- The use of proxy tools (pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy) and protocol tunneling (over DNS and HTTP) are techniques that can help the malware evade network security measures and maintain communication with C2 servers.
- These techniques are directly related to the Command and Control tactic and the specific techniques T1090-Proxy and T1572-Protocol Tunneling.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the SombRAT backdoor is likely to use these techniques to communicate with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
