Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the Sednit group's likely choice of encryption for secure communication with its C&C server during the Command and Control phase. Specifically, it inquires whether they are more likely to use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or a custom algorithm.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This refers to the phase where the attacker communicates with the compromised system to control it.
- **Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This indicates the use of symmetric encryption methods, which include AES.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **AES**: AES is a well-known, widely-used symmetric encryption standard. It is robust and has been extensively tested and reviewed by the cryptographic community.
- **Custom Algorithm**: While a custom algorithm could be used, it would likely be less secure and more difficult to maintain and update compared to a well-established standard like AES.

Given that the related TTPs specifically mention symmetric cryptography, and AES is a common and well-supported symmetric encryption method, it is reasonable to assume that AES would be a likely choice for the Sednit group.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question is about the choice of encryption for secure communication with the C&C server.
2. The related TTPs mention symmetric cryptography, which includes AES.
3. AES is a well-established and widely-used encryption standard.
4. A custom algorithm would be less likely and less secure.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible answer is that the Sednit group would use AES for secure communication with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
