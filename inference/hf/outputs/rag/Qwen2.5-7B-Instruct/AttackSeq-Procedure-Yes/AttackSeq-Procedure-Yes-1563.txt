Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the attacker has compromised SolarWinds and delivered the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access. The question then asks whether the Sunburst backdoor is likely to communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
  - **Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The use of web protocols for command and control (T1071.001) is a common method for attackers to communicate with their C2 servers. This aligns with the tactic of Command and Control.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - There is no direct evidence or context provided in the question that suggests the Sunburst backdoor would not use a protocol for further exploitation. The question does not provide any information that would indicate the backdoor would not communicate with a C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already gained initial access through a supply-chain attack and deployed the Sunburst backdoor.
- The related TTPs indicate that web protocols (T1071.001) are commonly used for command and control, which is a standard method for further exploitation.
- There is no information provided that would suggest the backdoor would not communicate with a C2 server using a protocol.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
