Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.
2. Running `cmd.exe` commands to execute SparrowDoor for Execution.
3. Communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication, which can include HTTPS.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exploiting Remote Code Execution (T1190)**: This is the Initial Access technique, which is the first step in the sequence.
- **Running `cmd.exe` to execute SparrowDoor (Execution)**: This is the next step in the sequence, indicating that the malware or payload (SparrowDoor) is being executed.
- **Communicating with the C&C server via HTTPS (T1071.001)**: This is the Command and Control technique, which is the final step in the sequence.

Given that SparrowDoor is a payload that is executed after gaining initial access, it is highly likely that the malware would use an encrypted channel (like HTTPS) to communicate with the C&C server for command and control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence starts with exploiting a vulnerability to gain Initial Access.
2. The next step is executing the payload (SparrowDoor).
3. The final step is establishing a secure channel for Command and Control, which is typically done using encrypted protocols like HTTPS.

Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
