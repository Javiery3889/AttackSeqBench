Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.
2. Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
3. Deploying custom malware (specifically, the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor).
4. Registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
5. Deploying webshells on compromised systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique involves using web shells to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique involves registering a service to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: Exploiting public-facing applications is a common initial access technique.
- **Lateral Movement**: Using RDP for lateral movement is also a common technique.
- **Custom Malware**: Deploying custom malware like the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a specific and advanced technique.
- **Persistence**: Registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service is a technique for maintaining persistence.
- **Webshells**: Deploying webshells on compromised systems is another technique for maintaining persistence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with exploiting public-facing applications, which is a valid initial access technique.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Using RDP for lateral movement is a valid technique.
3. **Custom Malware**: Deploying a custom backdoor like 'IPsec Helper' is a plausible next step, as it provides a more stealthy and persistent method of maintaining access.
4. **Persistence**: Registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service is a valid persistence technique.
5. **Webshells**: Deploying webshells on compromised systems is another valid persistence technique.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

Final Answer: A
