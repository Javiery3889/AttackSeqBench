Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where encrypted executables are loaded into legitimate system processes using process hollowing.
   - It then asks if Dexphot (a hypothetical malware) is likely to ensure persistence by using `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This indicates that the malware can use scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This indicates that the malware can use scheduled tasks during the execution phase to perform actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about persistence, which is directly related to the Tactic of Persistence.
   - The related TTPs mention the use of `schtasks.exe` for both persistence and execution, indicating that this technique can be used in both phases of the attack.
   - Given that the question specifically asks about persistence and the related TTPs include the use of `schtasks.exe` for persistence, it is reasonable to conclude that Dexphot could indeed use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving process hollowing and persistence.
   - The related TTPs confirm that `schtasks.exe` can be used for persistence.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Dexphot would use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection to ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
