Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
2. Connecting to an IP address controlled by the attacker using SmartFTP Client.
3. Exfiltrating data during the third stage of the attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not part of the attacker's command and control (C2) infrastructure.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which can include different stages of the attack.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of SmartFTP Client, which is a file transfer protocol, for exfiltrating data. The related TTPs (T1071.002 and T1048.003) support the use of file transfer protocols and unencrypted protocols for data exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the use of SmartFTP Client for exfiltration, as it would be more likely to use a C2 channel for data exfiltration, which is not the case here.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the attacker uses SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data, which is a file transfer protocol.
- The related TTPs (T1071.002 and T1048.003) support the use of file transfer protocols and unencrypted protocols for data exfiltration.
- The deployment of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery is a common initial step, and the use of SmartFTP Client for exfiltration is a plausible follow-up action.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
