Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spear-phishing emails as the initial access vector.
2. Custom-built backdoors and Remote Access Tools (RATs) during resource development.
3. Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This confirms that the initial access vector is indeed spear-phishing emails.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This indicates the use of custom-built malware, which can include backdoors and RATs.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It confirms the use of spear-phishing for initial access, custom-built backdoors and RATs for resource development, and environment-based evasion techniques.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence described in the question does not align with the TTPs, which contradicts the information provided in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that starts with initial access via spear-phishing, which is confirmed by the related TTPs.
- The next step involves resource development, which is supported by the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs, as indicated by the related TTPs.
- Finally, the question mentions environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, which is a plausible technique for executing payloads after gaining access.

Given the alignment of the question's sequence with the provided related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
