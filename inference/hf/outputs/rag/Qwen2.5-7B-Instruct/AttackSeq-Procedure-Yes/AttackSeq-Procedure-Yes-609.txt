Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
3. Abusing command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
4. Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This technique involves using malicious container images to execute code or perform actions.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking computing resources to perform malicious activities, such as cryptocurrency mining.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After gaining initial access through worms and exploiting Docker API ports, the attackers would likely use command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts. This is a common tactic to quickly monetize the compromised system. Finally, they would use malicious container images to achieve their ultimate objective of resource hijacking.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the attackers are already using command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts, it is unlikely that they would skip this step and directly move to resource hijacking through malicious container images.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1204.003-Malicious Image and T1496.001-Compute Hijacking, support the sequence of actions.
- The attackers would likely use command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts as a preliminary step before achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

**Final Answer: Yes**
