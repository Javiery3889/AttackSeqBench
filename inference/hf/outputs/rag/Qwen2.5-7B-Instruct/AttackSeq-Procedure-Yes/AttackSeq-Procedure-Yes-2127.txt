### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes for persistence.
   - It then asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR, to evade detection.
   - It also mentions that 'versioninfo.bat' is used to discover system details such as directory listings and running processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This technique is about using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This is the same technique, reinforcing the use of scheduled tasks for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of the Konni APT Group using heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR, to evade detection.
   - The related TTPs focus on the use of scheduled tasks, which is a common persistence technique. However, they do not directly address obfuscation or evasion techniques.
   - The Konni APT Group is known for using sophisticated and stealthy methods to evade detection. Obfuscation, including the use of XOR, is a common technique to make malware harder to detect and analyze.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the Konni APT Group is known for using advanced evasion techniques, and obfuscation like XOR is a common method to evade detection, the most plausible answer is that they would indeed use such techniques.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
