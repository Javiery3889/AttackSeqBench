Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information to evade detection. It then asks whether the malware is likely to retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves the use of web services for bidirectional communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
  - **Technique: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the use of web services for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Pastebin Postings**: Pastebin is a web service that allows users to post and share text snippets. It is a legitimate third-party online service that can be used to host C2 information.
- **Google+ Accounts**: Google+ is a social media platform that can also be used to host or share information. However, it is less commonly used for C2 communication compared to Pastebin.

Given the related TTPs, the use of web services for C2 communication aligns with the techniques T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication and T1102-Web Service. Pastebin is a well-known web service that can be used for hosting C2 information, making it a plausible choice for the malware to retrieve C2 information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware using legitimate third-party online services to evade detection.
- Pastebin is a legitimate web service that can be used to host C2 information.
- The related TTPs mention the use of web services for C2 communication, which aligns with Pastebin.
- Google+ is less commonly used for C2 communication compared to Pastebin.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware is likely to retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
