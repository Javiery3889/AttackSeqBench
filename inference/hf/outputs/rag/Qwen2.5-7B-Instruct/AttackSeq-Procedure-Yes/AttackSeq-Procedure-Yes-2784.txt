Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions that the iOS malware is likely to perform:
1. **Discovery Phase**: The malware collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
2. **Command and Control Phase**: The malware is expected to send the gathered information, write log messages, use a token for communication, and upload files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the malware collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial phase of collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the malware discovering files and directories, which is not directly mentioned in the question but could be part of the broader context of the malware's activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will perform all the actions mentioned in the Command and Control phase.
  - **Sending gathered information**: This aligns with the initial collection phase and the need to exfiltrate data.
  - **Writing log messages**: This is a common practice for malware to maintain logs of its activities.
  - **Using a token for communication**: This is a secure method for establishing a command and control channel.
  - **Uploading files**: This is a typical action for malware to exfiltrate data or to download additional payloads.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not perform the actions mentioned in the Command and Control phase.
  - Given the context of the question, this seems unlikely as the malware has already collected data and is likely to use it in the Command and Control phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already collected sensitive data during the Discovery phase.
- It is logical that the malware would use this data in the Command and Control phase.
- Writing log messages is a common practice for malware to maintain operational records.
- Using a token for communication ensures secure and reliable communication with the command and control server.
- Uploading files is a typical method for exfiltrating data or downloading additional malware.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
