Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Dexphot (a hypothetical or known malware) is likely to use fileless techniques for defense evasion after using process hollowing.
   - Process hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**:
     - This indicates that process hollowing is a technique used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**:
     - This suggests that process hollowing can also be used for privilege escalation, but the question is specifically about defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If Dexphot uses process hollowing, it is plausible that it would also use fileless techniques for defense evasion. Fileless techniques can help in evading detection by not leaving any traces on the disk, which is a common method for defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Dexphot does not use fileless techniques for defense evasion after using process hollowing, which seems less plausible given the nature of defense evasion techniques.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Process hollowing is a technique used for both defense evasion and privilege escalation.
   - Fileless techniques are commonly used for defense evasion to avoid detection and obfuscate activities.
   - Given that Dexphot is using process hollowing, it is reasonable to assume that it would also employ fileless techniques for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A**
