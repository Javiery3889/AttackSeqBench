Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of the 'Recon' module group to gather initial system information.
2. Use of the 'Password' module group to steal credentials.
3. Use of the 'Spreading' module group to infect other hosts via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials)**: This technique aligns with the initial gathering of system information, which is part of the 'Recon' module group.
- **Credential Access (T1555-Credentials from Password Stores)**: This technique aligns with the use of the 'Password' module group to steal credentials.
- **Initial Access (T1078.003-Local Accounts)**: This technique is relevant but not directly mentioned in the sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reconnaissance**: The 'Recon' module group is used to gather initial system information, which is a form of reconnaissance.
2. **Credential Access**: After gathering information, the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials, which is a form of credential access.
3. **Spreading**: The 'Spreading' module group is used to infect other hosts, which could be done via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
