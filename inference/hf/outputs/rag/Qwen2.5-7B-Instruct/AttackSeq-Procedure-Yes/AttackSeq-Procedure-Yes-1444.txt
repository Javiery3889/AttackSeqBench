### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Taidoor malware uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware.
   - It then asks if the new Taidoor variant is likely to communicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages or layers to communicate with the C2 server, which can help evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel, which can be used to exfiltrate data or receive further instructions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question does not provide specific information about the communication channels used by the new Taidoor variant, but it does mention that the malware uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself. This suggests that the malware is likely to use sophisticated techniques to establish a C2 channel.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware might use multi-stage channels, non-standard ports, and bidirectional communication to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - Given these techniques, it is plausible that the new Taidoor variant could use roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw as C2 servers, as these could be part of a multi-stage communication strategy or could be using non-standard ports or bidirectional communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
