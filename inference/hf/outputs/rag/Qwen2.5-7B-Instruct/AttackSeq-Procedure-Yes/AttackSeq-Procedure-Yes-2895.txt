Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a series of actions taken by a framework, including the use of specific plugins for document listing, keylogging, and screenshot capturing. It then asks whether the 'yty' framework is likely to exfiltrate the gathered data back to the C2 server using automated methods.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data. This is directly relevant to the question as it pertains to the automated exfiltration of data.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is also relevant as it describes how data is sent back to the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of automated methods (T1020) to exfiltrate data (T1041) over a C2 channel. Given that the question mentions the use of plugins for data collection, it is reasonable to assume that the 'yty' framework would use automated methods to exfiltrate this data.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the 'yty' framework does not use automated methods to exfiltrate data, which contradicts the information provided in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of plugins for data collection (document listing, keylogging, and screenshot capturing).
- The related TTPs mention automated exfiltration (T1020) and exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041).
- Given that the 'yty' framework is likely to use automated methods to exfiltrate the data collected by these plugins, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
