Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.
2. Shifting to using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.
3. Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making the malicious activity appear legitimate to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves delivering malware through a malicious attachment, such as an HWP file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)**: The question starts with exploiting a vulnerability through malicious HWP files, which aligns with this technique.
- **Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading)**: The question mentions using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion. This aligns with the T1036 technique, as it involves making the malicious activity appear legitimate.
- **Collection (Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents)**: This part of the question involves targeting specific groups with impersonated documents, which is a form of social engineering and aligns with the T1566.001 technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is achieved through exploiting a vulnerability in HWP files, which is a form of spearphishing.
2. To evade detection, the attackers use simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files, which is a form of masquerading.
3. Finally, the attackers target specific groups with impersonated documents, which is a form of spearphishing.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, the most plausible sequence aligns with the question's description.

### Final Answer: A
