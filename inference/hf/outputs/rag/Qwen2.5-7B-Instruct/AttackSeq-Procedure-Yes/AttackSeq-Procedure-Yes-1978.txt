Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions during the Initial Access phase:
1. Sending emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link.
2. The adversary using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
3. Using VPSs to host malware C2s.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the Resource Development phase:
- **T1584.004-Server**: This technique involves using servers for hosting or other malicious purposes.
- **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing or enhancing capabilities for the adversary.
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing links to deliver malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link)**: This TTP is directly related to the first part of the question, where emails with a PDF link are sent.
- **Resource Development (T1584.004-Server and T1587-Develop Capabilities)**: These TTPs are relevant to the second and third parts of the question, where compromised webservers and VPSs are used.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The adversary uses spearphishing emails to gain initial access to the target environment.
2. **Resource Development**: After gaining initial access, the adversary likely needs to set up infrastructure to deliver malware and maintain control. This involves using compromised webservers (T1584.004-Server) to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs (T1587-Develop Capabilities) to host malware C2s.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
