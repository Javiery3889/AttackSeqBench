Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal.
2. This JavaScript code redirected victims to an exploit landing page.
3. The exploit landing page exploited CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
4. After the exploit, heap spraying techniques were used to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by download, which aligns with the scenario where malicious JavaScript is used to redirect victims to an exploit landing page.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves the use of JavaScript for execution, which fits the scenario where malicious JavaScript is inserted into a news portal.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It mentions the use of malicious JavaScript to redirect victims and the exploitation of a specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome.
  - The related TTPs (T1189-Drive-by Compromise and T1059.007-JavaScript) support this sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the malicious JavaScript was not used to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, which contradicts the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where malicious JavaScript is used to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, which is supported by the TTP T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
- The exploit landing page then uses CVE-2019-13720 to gain further access, which is supported by the TTP T1059.007-JavaScript.
- The sequence then progresses to heap spraying techniques, which is a subsequent step in the attack sequence.

Given the alignment of the question with the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
