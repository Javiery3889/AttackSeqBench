Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence starting with a watering hole attack using an Internet Explorer zero-day for initial access. It then asks if the attack group is likely to adopt and customize several Android backdoors, utilize a massive infrastructure for Command and Control (C2), and deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This TTP involves the development and customization of malware, which aligns with the customization of Android backdoors.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This TTP involves compromising a system through a web page or drive-by download, which aligns with the watering hole attack using an Internet Explorer zero-day.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise)**: This is the first step in the attack sequence, which is correctly described in the question.
- **Resource Development (T1587.001-Malware)**: This TTP involves the development and customization of malware, which aligns with the customization of Android backdoors.
- **Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, the use of a massive infrastructure for C2 is a common follow-up step after initial access, especially for long-term persistence.
- **Second-stage Backdoors with Hardcoded Proxy Addresses and Credentials**: This is a specific technique that can be used for maintaining persistence and controlling the compromised system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack starts with a watering hole attack using an Internet Explorer zero-day, which is a form of drive-by compromise (T1189).
2. After gaining initial access, the attackers are likely to develop and customize malware (T1587.001) to target Android devices, as the question suggests.
3. Utilizing a massive infrastructure for C2 is a common practice to maintain long-term access and control.
4. Deploying second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials is a specific technique that can be used to maintain persistence and control.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
