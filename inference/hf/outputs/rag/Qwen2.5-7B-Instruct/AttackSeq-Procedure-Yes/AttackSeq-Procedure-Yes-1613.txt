Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
1. They used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands.
2. They then deployed Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, with the goal of disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders.
- **File Deletion (Technique T1070.004)**: This technique involves deleting files to disrupt the victim's operations.
- **Impact (Tactic)**: This tactic involves actions that cause harm or disruption to the victim.
- **Inhibit System Recovery (Technique T1490)**: This technique involves actions that prevent the victim from recovering from an attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs:
    - The use of backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands is a form of Defense Evasion.
    - Deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files is a form of File Deletion and Inhibit System Recovery, which are directly related to causing disruption and impact.
  - The actions described in the question are consistent with the tactics and techniques provided in the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence of actions described in the question does not align with the related TTPs. However, the related TTPs clearly support the actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that align with the related TTPs.
- The use of backdoor malware for communication and remote command execution is a form of Defense Evasion.
- Deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files is a form of File Deletion and Inhibit System Recovery, which are directly related to causing disruption and impact.
- The related TTPs support the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
