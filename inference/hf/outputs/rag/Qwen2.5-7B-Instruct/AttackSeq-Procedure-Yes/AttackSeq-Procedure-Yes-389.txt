Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Vyveva:
1. Using an installer to create a new service for persistence.
2. Decrypting strings for defense evasion.
3. Obtaining file and directory listings.
4. Compressing files with zlib for collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the collection and discovery activities:
- **T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves using a library to archive files.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves using a custom method to archive files.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This is directly related to the question's third step, where Vyveva is obtaining file and directory listings.
- **Techniques T1560.002 and T1560.003**: These are related to the fourth step, where Vyveva is compressing files for collection. However, they do not directly address the third step of obtaining file and directory listings.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if Vyveva is likely to obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities.
- The related TTPs confirm that Vyveva would be involved in discovery activities (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).
- The sequence of actions described in the question logically follows the discovery of files and directories before compressing them for collection.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Vyveva would indeed obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files for collection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
