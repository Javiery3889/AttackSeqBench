Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. **Defense Evasion**: Employing image files to conceal malicious components.
2. **Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer**: Injecting a malicious payload.
3. **AES Encryption**: For communication with the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion**: The question mentions using image files to conceal malicious components, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
- **Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer**: The question asks if the campaign is likely to use Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload. This is directly related to the TTP T1055.012-Process Hollowing.
- **AES Encryption**: The question also mentions AES encryption for communication with the C&C server, which is a separate TTP not directly related to the TTPs provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about a specific sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs confirm the use of Process Hollowing (T1055.012) as a Defense Evasion technique.
- The question does not provide any information about Privilege Escalation, so we can disregard the Tactic: Privilege Escalation.
- The sequence described in the question (Defense Evasion -> Process Hollowing -> AES Encryption) aligns with the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
