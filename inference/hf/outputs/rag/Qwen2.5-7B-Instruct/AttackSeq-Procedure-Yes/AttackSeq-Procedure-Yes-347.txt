Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The attackers demonstrated impressive reconnaissance capabilities by understanding the SolarWinds source code and internal development domain names.
2. They then developed malware capabilities as part of their Resource Development efforts.
3. Finally, they achieved Initial Access through a compromised software update.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.004-Exploits**: This technique involves the development and use of exploits to gain an advantage.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This technique involves the development and use of malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The attackers first demonstrated reconnaissance capabilities, then developed malware (T1587.001-Malware), and finally achieved Initial Access through a compromised software update.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the attackers did not develop malware as part of their Resource Development efforts, it would contradict the sequence of actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question clearly states that the attackers demonstrated reconnaissance capabilities, then developed malware, and finally achieved Initial Access.
- The related TTPs, T1587.004-Exploits and T1587.001-Malware, support the development of malware as part of the Resource Development tactic.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
