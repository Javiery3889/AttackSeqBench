Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Scanning the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
2. Targeting user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.
3. Exploiting remote services for lateral movement within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This TTP is about moving laterally within a network by exploiting remote services.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This TTP involves accessing credentials stored in the LSASS memory, which can be done using tools like Mimikatz.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after scanning the network, the attacker would target user credentials and then exploit remote services for lateral movement.
  - The related TTPs support this sequence:
    - **T1003.001-LSASS Memory** aligns with the use of procdump and Mimikatz to access credentials.
    - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** aligns with the subsequent exploitation of remote services for lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is unlikely.
  - There is no direct contradiction in the related TTPs that would make this sequence unlikely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a logical sequence of actions: scanning the network, accessing credentials, and then moving laterally.
- The related TTPs (T1003.001-LSASS Memory and T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services) support this sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
