### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the LODEINFO malware.
   - The sequence is: Spear phishing → Delivery of LODEINFO malware → Injection of malicious code into svchost.exe process → Persistence through registry manipulation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or escalate privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC):** This technique involves using APCs to inject code into a process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique is similar to T1055 and involves hiding or obfuscating the injection process to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if the LODEINFO malware will inject malicious code into a svchost.exe process during Execution using Native API techniques.
   - The related TTPs mention T1055-Process Injection, which is directly relevant to the question.
   - T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) is also related but is more specific to using APCs, which is a subset of process injection techniques.
   - The question does not specify the exact technique but asks about "Execution using Native API techniques," which aligns well with T1055-Process Injection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the LODEINFO malware would use process injection techniques, including Native API techniques, to inject malicious code into a svchost.exe process.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
