Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where PowerShell scripts and batch files are used to execute the Milestone backdoor on infected systems.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Deep Panda would perform system information discovery before utilizing the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates that the attackers are using PowerShell to execute malicious scripts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This indicates that the attackers are gathering information about the target system before taking further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: first, the execution of malicious scripts, and then the use of the backdoor.
   - The related TTPs suggest that system information discovery is a common tactic used by attackers to gather intelligence about the target environment before executing further actions.
   - It is logical that after executing the malicious scripts, the attackers would gather system information to understand the environment and tailor their communication with the C2 server accordingly.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already executed the Milestone backdoor using PowerShell scripts and batch files.
   - It is a standard practice in cyber attacks to gather system information to understand the environment and ensure the backdoor can communicate effectively.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that Deep Panda would perform system information discovery before utilizing the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
