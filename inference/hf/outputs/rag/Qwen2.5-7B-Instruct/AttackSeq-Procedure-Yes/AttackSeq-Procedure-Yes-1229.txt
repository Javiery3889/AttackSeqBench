Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. POWERSHOWER collects system information.
2. The collected information is sent to the C2 server.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the system will communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop for maintaining Command and Control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This is the initial step where POWERSHOWER collects system information.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1071.004-DNS**: These techniques are used for maintaining C2 communication.

Given that the question asks about maintaining Command and Control, it is logical to assume that after collecting system information, the malware would establish a communication loop with the C2 server to maintain control over the infected machine.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. POWERSHOWER collects system information (T1082-System Information Discovery).
2. The collected information is sent to the C2 server.
3. To maintain Command and Control, the malware would need to establish a communication loop with the C2 server (T1071.001-Web Protocols or T1071.004-DNS).

Based on the above reasoning, it is highly likely that the malware will communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop for maintaining Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
