### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT3 uses a zero-day vulnerability to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor via phishing emails.
   - It then asks whether the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, while GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves the use of email addresses in the context of reconnaissance. However, it does not directly relate to the communication methods of the backdoors.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using links in spearphishing emails to deliver malware. It is relevant to the initial delivery method but not the communication method.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using attachments in spearphishing emails to deliver malware. It is also relevant to the initial delivery method but not the communication method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SHOTPUT Backdoor (Delivered by APT3):** The question does not provide specific information about the communication method of the SHOTPUT backdoor. However, it is common for backdoors to use hardcoded CnC addresses for communication, especially if the attackers want to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **GH0ST RAT (Delivered by APT18):** The question suggests that GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address. This implies that the communication method for GH0ST RAT is not hardcoded but rather uses a CnC address associated with APT18.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided, it is plausible that the SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3, might use hardcoded CnC addresses for communication, while GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, uses a CnC address associated with APT18.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
