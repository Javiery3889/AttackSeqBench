Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Searching for sensitive documents across local and network drives.
2. Capturing screenshots every minute during data collection.
3. The malware is likely to use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control (C&C) communication.
4. The harvested documents are then transferred to the C&C server for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C&C)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for C&C communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated exfiltration of data to an external server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs. The use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and the exfiltration of harvested documents (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) are both mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs. If the malware is using HTTP and HTTPS for C&C communication and exfiltrating data, it would be unlikely to not use these protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include C&C communication and data exfiltration.
- The related TTPs explicitly mention the use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and automated exfiltration of data (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).
- Both of these TTPs are directly relevant to the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
