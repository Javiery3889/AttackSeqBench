Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deploying `tcpdump` to scrape credential-containing files.
2. Enumerating system data directories and GPS information.
3. Facilitating Discovery.
4. Automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the final step in the sequence.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the step of enumerating system data directories.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.
  - It aligns with the related TTPs, as `T1083-File and Directory Discovery` is a step in the `Discovery` tactic, and `T1020-Automated Exfiltration` is a step in the `Exfiltration` tactic.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not plausible.
  - However, the related TTPs support the sequence, making this choice less likely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves multiple steps: scraping credential-containing files, enumerating system data directories, facilitating discovery, and exfiltrating the data.
- The related TTPs support the steps of `File and Directory Discovery` (T1083) and `Automated Exfiltration` (T1020).
- The sequence of actions in the question is consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where `Discovery` (T1083) typically precedes `Exfiltration` (T1020).

### Final Answer: Yes
