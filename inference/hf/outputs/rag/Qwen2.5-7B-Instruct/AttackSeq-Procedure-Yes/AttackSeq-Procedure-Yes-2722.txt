Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Credential access using the Responder tool.
2. Lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC.
3. Conducting discovery activities such as network share discovery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using SMB or Windows admin shares for lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning LLMNR/NBT-NS to steal credentials.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC)**: This technique involves using WMIC for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access**: The question mentions using the Responder tool, which aligns with the technique T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question asks about using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement. WMIC is mentioned as a technique (T1047) in the related TTPs, and T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares is also relevant for lateral movement.
- **Discovery**: The question mentions network share discovery, which aligns with the technique T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Credential Access**: The Responder tool is used to harvest credentials, which aligns with T1557.001.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The use of Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement is plausible, as both are mentioned in the related TTPs.
3. **Discovery**: Conducting network share discovery using SMB/Windows admin shares is a common follow-up step, aligning with T1021.002.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs is Yes.

Final Answer: A
