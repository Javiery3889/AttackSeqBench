### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the PowerLess Backdoor.
   - The backdoor achieves credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and utilizing a keylogger.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery as part of its capability.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:** This technique involves the attacker discovering local user accounts on the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves accessing the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to extract credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping OS credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The PowerLess Backdoor is described as achieving credential access through OS credential dumping and keylogging.
   - The question asks if the backdoor will target local user accounts for account discovery.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the backdoor is already involved in credential access and OS credential dumping, which are techniques that can provide information about local user accounts.
   - The technique T1087.001-Local Account specifically targets the discovery of local user accounts, which aligns with the question's query.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the PowerLess Backdoor, having already achieved credential access and OS credential dumping, is likely to target local user accounts for account discovery as part of its capability.

Final Answer: A
