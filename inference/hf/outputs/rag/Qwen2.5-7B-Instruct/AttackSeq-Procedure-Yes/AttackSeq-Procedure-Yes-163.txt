Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Reconnaissance through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages.
2. Gathering sensitive information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication.
3. Acquiring infrastructures by developing phishing sites that impersonate legitimate services.
4. Leveraging these phishing sites for credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves using spear-phishing emails to target specific services.
- **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using spear-phishing to gather information about specific services.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves creating and deploying phishing sites to steal credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Reconnaissance**: The question mentions reconnaissance through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages, which aligns with **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**.
- **Gathering Sensitive Information**: The question states that sensitive information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication is gathered. This step is part of the reconnaissance phase.
- **Acquiring Infrastructures**: The question mentions acquiring infrastructures by developing phishing sites that impersonate legitimate services. This aligns with **T1566-Phishing**.
- **Leveraging Phishing Sites**: The question states that these phishing sites are used to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks. This aligns with **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The initial phase involves gathering information through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages, which is covered by **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**.
2. **Gathering Sensitive Information**: This step is part of the reconnaissance phase and is not explicitly covered by a specific TTP but is implied in the context.
3. **Acquiring Infrastructures**: The next step involves developing phishing sites, which is covered by **T1566-Phishing**.
4. **Leveraging Phishing Sites**: The final step involves using these phishing sites for credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks, which is covered by **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is consistent with the actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
