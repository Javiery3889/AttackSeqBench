Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs in an attack:
1. FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email.
2. The email contained a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
3. The VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file.
4. The .doc file led to the execution of the malware.

The question then asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding information to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The use of PowerShell for execution (T1059.001) is directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
  - The deobfuscation of base64 encoded code (T1140) is also a common technique to evade detection, which aligns with the tactic of defense evasion.
  - The sequence of events described in the question (phishing, downloading, opening, and execution) fits well with the use of PowerShell for further execution, especially if the code is base64 encoded to avoid detection.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that PowerShell is not used for execution, which contradicts the related TTPs.
  - It also suggests that the malware does not use base64 encoding, which is a common technique to evade detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sophisticated attack sequence involving multiple steps, including phishing, downloading, and execution.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of PowerShell for execution and the deobfuscation of base64 encoded code.
- The sequence of events and the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs strongly support the use of PowerShell and base64 encoding in the attack.

### Final Answer: Yes
