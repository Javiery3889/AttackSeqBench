Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlackSoul communicates with a C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding. The question then asks if it is likely that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration
- Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the C2 channel to exfiltrate data. Given that BlackSoul is already communicating with the C2 server using a specific protocol (RESTful Strapi) and encoding (JSON), it is highly plausible that BlackSoul would use this same channel to exfiltrate data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Communication Protocol**: BlackSoul is using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding to communicate with the C2 server. This indicates a secure and established method of communication.
2. **Exfiltration Tactic**: The tactic of exfiltration is relevant here, as the goal is to transfer data from the compromised system to the attacker.
3. **C2 Channel Utilization**: Since the C2 channel is already being used for communication, it is logical to assume that the same channel would be used for exfiltration to maintain operational security and avoid detection.
4. **Automated Exfiltration**: The question specifically mentions "automated exfiltration," which implies a systematic and possibly continuous process of data transfer. Given the established communication channel, automated exfiltration is a plausible scenario.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
