Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Rising Sun implant:
1. Initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
2. Communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
3. Encryption of the data using RC4.
4. Obfuscation of the data using Base64 encoding.

The question then asks if it is likely that the implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding to facilitate data exfiltration to the control server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to maintain access to a network or system.
- **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to make it harder to analyze.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used by attackers to avoid detection by security tools.
- **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation or encoding from data to make it usable.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **RC4 Stream Encryption**: RC4 is a symmetric stream cipher that is known for its simplicity and speed. It is often used to encrypt data in transit, especially in older protocols.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that is commonly used to encode binary data into an ASCII string format. It is often used to make the data more human-readable or to avoid issues with certain character sets.

Given the related TTPs, we can infer the following:
- **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique aligns with the use of Base64 encoding, as it is a standard method to encode data.
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique aligns with the use of Base64 encoding, as it is a form of obfuscation that needs to be decoded to be usable.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is first collected, then encrypted with RC4, and then encoded with Base64.
- The related TTPs indicate that encoding (Base64) is a common technique used to avoid detection or to make data harder to analyze.
- The use of RC4 for encryption and Base64 for encoding is a plausible sequence of TTPs, as it aligns with the techniques described in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
