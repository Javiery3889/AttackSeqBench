Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Registry queries using functions like 'GetStringValue' and 'GetDWORDValue' for system information collection.
2. Use of 'ZwGetContextThread' and 'ZwSetContextThread' to discover process and thread information.
3. Command and control activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1012-Query Registry**: This technique is directly related to the first part of the question, where registry queries are used for system information collection.
- **Technique T1015-Query Information**: This technique is not explicitly mentioned but is related to gathering information, which could include process and thread information.
- **Technique T1008-Process Discovery**: This technique involves discovering processes and threads, which aligns with the use of 'ZwGetContextThread' and 'ZwSetContextThread'.
- **Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique is related to the final part of the question, where command and control activities using HTTP and HTTPS are performed.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Registry Queries (T1012-Query Registry)**: The question starts with registry queries, which is a common initial step for gathering system information.
2. **Process and Thread Discovery (T1008-Process Discovery)**: After gathering system information, the next logical step is to discover processes and threads, which can be achieved using 'ZwGetContextThread' and 'ZwSetContextThread'.
3. **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: Once the attacker has the necessary information, they can proceed to establish command and control channels using HTTP and HTTPS.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
