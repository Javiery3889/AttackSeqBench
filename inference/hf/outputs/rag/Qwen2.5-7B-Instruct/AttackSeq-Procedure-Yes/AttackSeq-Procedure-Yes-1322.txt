Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by CosmicDuke:
1. Persistence is achieved by creating a scheduled task and installing a specific service.
2. The next step is to search for files, targeting non-English filenames.
3. After that, information is collected using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**

These TTPs confirm that CosmicDuke uses scheduled tasks for persistence, which aligns with the first part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate the answer choices based on the provided information:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will search for files with non-English filenames, then collect information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
  - The related TTPs do not directly mention searching for files or targeting non-English filenames. However, it is plausible that CosmicDuke might perform such actions as part of its discovery phase to gather information about the target environment.
  - The keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer are common techniques used by APTs to collect information, which aligns with the described actions.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will not perform the described actions.
  - Given the lack of direct evidence in the related TTPs for searching files with non-English filenames, this choice seems less likely. However, it is important to note that APTs can employ a wide range of techniques not explicitly listed in the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are plausible for an APT like CosmicDuke.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of scheduled tasks for persistence, which matches the first part of the sequence.
- While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention searching for files with non-English filenames, it is a reasonable assumption that such actions could be part of the discovery phase.
- The keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer are common techniques used by APTs to collect information, which aligns with the described actions.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
