Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
2. Deployment of public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
3. Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems or applications.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access to a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Vulnerability Scanning (T1595.002)**: This is the first step in the sequence, where the group identifies vulnerable services.
- **Exploiting Public-Facing Applications (T1190)**: This is the next step, where the group deploys public exploits on the identified vulnerable services.
- **Using Stolen Credentials for Persistent Access (T1547.005)**: This is the final step, where the group uses stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in the compromised systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Vulnerability Scanning (T1595.002)**: The group first scans for vulnerabilities in the external IP addresses.
2. **Exploiting Public-Facing Applications (T1190)**: After identifying vulnerable services, the group deploys public exploits to gain initial access.
3. **Using Stolen Credentials for Persistent Access (T1547.005)**: Once initial access is gained, the group uses stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in the compromised systems.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Vulnerability Scanning (T1595.002)
- Exploiting Public-Facing Applications (T1190)
- Using Stolen Credentials for Persistent Access (T1547.005)

### Final Answer: A
