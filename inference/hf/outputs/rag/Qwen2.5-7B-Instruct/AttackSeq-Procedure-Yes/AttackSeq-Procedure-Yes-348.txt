Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors have already executed code using system services and software deployment tools.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actors would use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques to gather information about the systems and the internal network before attempting to gain elevated permissions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1007 - System Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating system services to understand the environment.
   - **T1012 - Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system.
   - **T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher-level access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where the threat actors have already executed code. This implies they have some level of access to the system.
   - Before attempting to gain elevated permissions (T1068), it is common for threat actors to gather as much information as possible about the system and the network to understand the environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - Both T1007 and T1012 are techniques that help in gathering information about the system and the network, which is a logical step before attempting to escalate privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the threat actors would use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques to gather information before attempting to gain elevated permissions.
   - Therefore, the answer is: "Yes."

Final Answer: A
