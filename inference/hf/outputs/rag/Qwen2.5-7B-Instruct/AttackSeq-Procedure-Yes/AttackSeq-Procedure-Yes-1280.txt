Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
2. Downloads and installs an MSI package.
3. Malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper are executed.
4. The backdoor decrypts its configuration file.
5. The backdoor connects to the command-and-control servers via SSL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the client machine.
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.
- **T1137.006-Add-ins**: This technique involves using add-ins to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.
  - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP aligns with the initial exploitation and execution of the malicious documents.
  - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This TTP could be used to load the backdoor into a legitimate process, which is a form of persistence.
  - **T1137.006-Add-ins**: This TTP could also be used to execute the backdoor through add-ins, which is another form of persistence.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will not be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.
  - This does not align well with the typical sequence of actions in a sophisticated attack, where execution often precedes persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the backdoor's dropper is executed, followed by persistence and connection to the command-and-control servers.
- The related TTPs (T1203, T1574.002, and T1137.006) all support the idea that execution precedes persistence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the malicious documents are executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

**Final Answer: A**
