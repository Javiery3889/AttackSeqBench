Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions during the execution phase:
1. Decoding and executing a base64 encoded blob.
2. Depending on the system architecture.
3. Executing the payload in memory using process injection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating information to reveal its true nature.
  - **Technique: T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a legitimate process to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions:
    1. Decoding a base64 encoded blob (T1140).
    2. Executing the payload in memory (which can be seen as a form of process injection, T1055.001).
  - The question specifically mentions process injection as part of the defense evasion tactic, which is directly supported by the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions. It would imply that the payload is not executed in memory using process injection, which contradicts the question's description.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the payload is decoded and then executed in memory using process injection.
- The related TTPs confirm that both deobfuscation (T1140) and DLL injection (T1055.001) are part of the defense evasion tactic.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
