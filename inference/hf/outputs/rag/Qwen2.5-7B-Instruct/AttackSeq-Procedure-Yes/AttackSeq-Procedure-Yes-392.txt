Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Vyveva's backdoor:
1. Obtaining system information (computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and local IP address).
2. Collecting files from the computer.
3. Compressing the collected files with zlib.
4. Transmitting the compressed files to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves archiving files using a library, which aligns with compressing files with zlib.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial step of obtaining system information.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the first step of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after obtaining system information, the backdoor will collect files, compress them, and then transmit them.
  - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1560.002-Archive via Library and T1005-Data from Local System.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not collect files after obtaining system information.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as it skips the step of collecting files, which is a critical part of the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where system information is obtained first, followed by the collection of files, compression, and transmission.
- The related TTPs support the collection of files (T1005-Data from Local System) and the compression of files (T1560.002-Archive via Library).
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes file collection after system information is obtained.

**Final Answer: A**
