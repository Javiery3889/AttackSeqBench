Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Iranian state-backed hackers:
1. They used phishing attacks through email and social media accounts to gain initial access.
2. They then tailored their targeting approach by gathering information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique aligns with the first part of the question, where phishing attacks were used to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique aligns with the second part of the question, where the hackers gathered information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique also aligns with the second part of the question, as it involves gathering information through phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The hackers first used phishing to gain initial access and then gathered detailed information about the victims.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the hackers did not gather detailed information about the victims, it would contradict the second part of the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the hackers first used phishing to gain initial access and then gathered detailed information about the victims.
- The related TTPs confirm that both phishing and gathering victim information are part of the attack sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
