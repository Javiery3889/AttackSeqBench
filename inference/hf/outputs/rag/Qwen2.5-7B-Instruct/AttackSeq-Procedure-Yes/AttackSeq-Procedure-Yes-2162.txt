### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email during the Initial Access phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the detection of Command and Control (C2) activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all related to the Initial Access phase and specifically mention spear phishing techniques (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
   - These TTPs provide context that the initial compromise was through a spear phishing email.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after detecting C2 activity, Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would automate the investigation process.
     - Given that Darktrace is known for its AI-driven security solutions, it is plausible that such a system would automatically detect and analyze C2 activity.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would not automate the investigation process.
     - While it is possible that manual intervention might be required, the question does not provide enough context to definitively rule out automation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context provided by the related TTPs and the capabilities of modern AI-driven security solutions, the most plausible scenario is that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would automate the investigation process.
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
