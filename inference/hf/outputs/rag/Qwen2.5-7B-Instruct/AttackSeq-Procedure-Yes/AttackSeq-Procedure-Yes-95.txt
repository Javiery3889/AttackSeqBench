Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document.
2. Dropping an HTA file.
3. Using WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
4. Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

The question then asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the client machine.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The HTA file is a client-side script that can be used to establish a connection with a C2 server.
  - The use of webserv-redir.net for Command and Control aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique, which involves using web protocols for command and control.
  - The sequence of TTPs described (exploitation, dropping, checking for antivirus, and executing the backdoor) suggests a complete attack lifecycle, and leveraging a web redirection service for C2 communication is a common technique to evade detection.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the HTA file does not communicate with the C2 server or does not use webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.
  - Given the context of the attack sequence and the related TTPs, this seems less likely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described involves a complete lifecycle of an attack, from initial exploitation to establishing a C2 channel.
- The use of an HTA file and a web redirection service (webserv-redir.net) for Command and Control is a common and effective technique to evade detection and maintain persistence.
- The related TTPs support the use of web protocols for Command and Control.

**Final Answer: Yes**
