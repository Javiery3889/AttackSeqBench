Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Harvester's custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.
2. The custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon communicate with C&C servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique is directly related to the first part of the question, where Harvester's custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots. This confirms that the initial action of capturing screenshots is part of the collection tactic.
- The question then asks about the communication with C&C servers using an encrypted channel. This involves the use of the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon, which are likely to be used for communication with the C&C servers.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Collection**: The question starts with the collection of screenshots, which is a form of data collection.
2. **Communication**: After the collection, the question asks about the communication with C&C servers. This is a logical next step in the attack sequence.
3. **Backdoor Usage**: The use of Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon for communication is a plausible method for an attacker to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.
4. **Encryption**: The question specifically mentions the use of an encrypted channel, which is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure data security during communication.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will indeed communicate with C&C servers using an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
