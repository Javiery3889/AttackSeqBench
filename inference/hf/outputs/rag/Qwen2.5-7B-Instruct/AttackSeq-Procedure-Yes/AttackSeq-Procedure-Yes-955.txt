Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows to gain initial access and achieve privilege escalation using specific CVEs.
   - The question then asks whether a Stager module would notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly-facing applications to gain initial access to a network or system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher levels of access or privileges within a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the techniques of exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access and then escalating privileges.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the behavior of a Stager module and whether it would notify of successful exploitation before downloading a Dropper module.
   - In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a Stager module is typically used to deliver and execute a payload, often after initial access has been achieved. The Dropper module is the payload that is downloaded and executed to further the attack.
   - There is no specific TTP that mandates a Stager module to notify of successful exploitation before downloading a Dropper module. The Stager's primary function is to deliver the payload, and it is not a requirement for it to notify of successful exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not necessarily include a Stager module notifying of successful exploitation before downloading a Dropper module. The Stager's role is to deliver the payload, and there is no inherent requirement for it to notify of successful exploitation.
   - Therefore, the answer is: B: No.

Final Answer: B: No
