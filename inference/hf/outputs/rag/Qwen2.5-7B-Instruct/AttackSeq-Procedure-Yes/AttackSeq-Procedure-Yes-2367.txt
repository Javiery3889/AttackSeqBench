Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Netsat.exe executes commands from an encrypted file.
2. The malware infects removable media and collects system files.
3. The malware is expected to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details.
4. The malware cleans up by deleting key artifacts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of the attacker's presence.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target environment, including file and directory structures.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique aligns with the action of performing recursive directory listings and collecting system details. It is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to understand the target environment.
- **Technique T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique aligns with the action of cleaning up by deleting key artifacts. It is a common step in the cleanup phase to avoid detection.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Infection and Data Collection**: The malware infects removable media and collects system files. This is a typical initial infection and data collection phase.
2. **Reconnaissance**: After collecting system files, the malware likely performs recursive directory listings and collects system details. This is a standard step in the reconnaissance phase to gather more information about the target environment.
3. **Cleanup**: Finally, the malware cleans up by deleting key artifacts. This is a common step to remove evidence of its presence and avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up by deleting key artifacts.

Final Answer: A
