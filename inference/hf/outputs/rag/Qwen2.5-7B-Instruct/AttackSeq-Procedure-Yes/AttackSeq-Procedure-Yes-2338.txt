Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. Persistence is established through a scheduled task that executes `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL every two hours.
2. The question asks if it is likely that RevengeRAT will establish communication with its command and control (C2) servers and send victim machine information to specific domains.
3. The attacker's infrastructure is identified to be located in Canada and Brazil.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Persistence**: T1053.005-Scheduled Task
- **Exfiltration**: T1029-Scheduled Transfer
- **Execution**: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The question mentions that persistence is established through a scheduled task that executes `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL every two hours. This aligns with the TTP T1053.005-Scheduled Task.
- **Exfiltration**: The question asks about establishing communication with C2 servers and sending victim machine information. This aligns with the TTP T1029-Scheduled Transfer, which involves the transfer of data to an external server.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Persistence**: The scheduled task that executes `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL is a form of persistence. This is confirmed by the TTP T1053.005-Scheduled Task.
2. **Exfiltration**: After establishing persistence, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate data to the C2 servers. The domains mentioned ('office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net') are likely used for this purpose, which aligns with the TTP T1029-Scheduled Transfer.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after establishing persistence, the malware would indeed establish communication with its C2 servers and send victim machine information. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
