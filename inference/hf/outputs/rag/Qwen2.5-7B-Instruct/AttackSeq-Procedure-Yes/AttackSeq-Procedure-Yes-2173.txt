Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Taidoor malware:
1. Evades defenses by obfuscating MAC addresses.
2. Utilizes these obfuscated MAC addresses as RC4 encryption keys for network communication.
3. Communicates with C&C servers.
4. Installs an RC4-encrypted executable file.
5. Creates an autorun registry entry.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
  - This technique involves using encryption or encoding to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
  - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like RC4) for secure communication with C&C servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The malware is using RC4 encryption for network communication, which is a form of symmetric cryptography. It is also likely to communicate with C&C servers and install an RC4-encrypted executable file, as this would help in evading detection and maintaining persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the malware is using RC4 encryption for network communication, it is highly likely that it would also communicate with C&C servers and install an RC4-encrypted executable file.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is described as using RC4 encryption for network communication, which is a form of symmetric cryptography. This aligns with the T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography technique.
- The malware is also described as evading defenses by obfuscating MAC addresses, which is a form of defense evasion (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File).
- Given these actions, it is highly plausible that the malware would communicate with C&C servers and install an RC4-encrypted executable file to maintain persistence and evade detection.

**Final Answer: Yes**
