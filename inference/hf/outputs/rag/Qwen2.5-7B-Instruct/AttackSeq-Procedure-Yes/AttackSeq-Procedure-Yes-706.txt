Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT12:
1. Deployment of updated versions of malware (Aumlib and Ixeshe).
2. Encoding the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware.
3. Employing a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic.
4. Connecting to specific URLs (status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js) for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the techniques used:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection during command and control communications.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encoding or encrypting files to evade detection by security systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's description of encoding the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and using a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic.
  - The use of encoding and different patterns fits the TTPs related to Command and Control and Defense Evasion.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the question's description and the related TTPs. It would imply that APT12 does not use encoding techniques, which is inconsistent with the provided context.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve encoding and using different patterns, which aligns with the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of encoding techniques for both Command and Control and Defense Evasion.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
