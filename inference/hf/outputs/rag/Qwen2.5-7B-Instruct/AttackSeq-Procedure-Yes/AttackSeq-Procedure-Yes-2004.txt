Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Communication with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
2. Exfiltration of files to the C2 server.
3. Downloading files to the infected machine.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the KopiLuwak backdoor is capable of both exfiltrating files to the C2 server and downloading files to the infected machine.
  - The related TTPs indicate that the backdoor is using a C2 channel for exfiltration, which aligns with the question's description of exfiltrating files to the C2 server.
  - The KopiLuwak backdoor is known for its ability to download and upload files, which aligns with the question's description of downloading files to the infected machine.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the KopiLuwak backdoor is not capable of both exfiltrating files to the C2 server and downloading files to the infected machine.
  - This does not align with the known capabilities of the KopiLuwak backdoor, which is designed to perform both actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The KopiLuwak backdoor is known to use a C2 channel for exfiltration, which matches the description of exfiltrating files to the C2 server.
- The backdoor is also known to download files to the infected machine, which matches the description of downloading files to the infected machine.
- The related TTPs, specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, support the exfiltration aspect of the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
