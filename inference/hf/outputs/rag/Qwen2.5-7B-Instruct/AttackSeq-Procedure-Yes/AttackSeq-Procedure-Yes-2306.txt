Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an adversary has used Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz to dump credentials. The next step in the sequence is to determine if the adversary is likely to copy local file- and directory lists in preparation for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves the adversary staging data locally before exfiltration. This aligns with the question's context of preparing for exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the adversary collecting data from local systems, which is relevant to the credential dumping and file/directory listing activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the TTPs related to local data staging and data collection from local systems. After dumping credentials and gathering file and directory lists, it is a logical step to stage this data locally before exfiltration.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions. If the adversary has already gathered credentials and file/directory lists, it would be unusual and inefficient not to prepare for exfiltration by staging this data locally.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary has already used Mimikatz to dump credentials and is likely to gather file and directory lists.
- The related TTPs, T1074.001-Local Data Staging and T1005-Data from Local System, support the idea of preparing for exfiltration by staging the collected data locally.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that the adversary would copy the results of the discovery phase in preparation for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
