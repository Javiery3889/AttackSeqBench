Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Aria-body loader establishes persistence.
2. The Aria-body backdoor gathers system information.
3. The collected data is sent to a C&C domain using an XORed password.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system itself, such as the host name, computer name, and public IP address.

Given the question, the Aria-body backdoor is likely to gather system information such as the host name, computer name, and public IP address, which aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence Establishment**: The Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
2. **System Information Gathering**: The Aria-body backdoor gathers system information such as the host name, computer name, and public IP address, which is a common action in the Discovery phase.
3. **Data Transmission**: The collected data is sent to a C&C domain using an XORed password, which is a method of obfuscation often used in Command and Control communications.

Based on the related TTPs and the described actions, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Aria-body backdoor will indeed gather system information during the Discovery phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
