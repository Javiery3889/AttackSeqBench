Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of tactics where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. These messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges. The attackers then use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials. Finally, they lock out the original owners by changing account passwords.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts**: This technique involves attackers compromising accounts to gain access to sensitive information or to perform actions on behalf of the account owner.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation**: This technique involves attackers using deception to mislead victims into performing actions that benefit the attacker.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves attackers compromising email accounts to gather information or to use the email account for further attacks.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Phishing Messages**: The question mentions phishing messages, which aligns with the use of impersonation (T1656) to deliver the initial attack.
- **Phishing Sites**: The question states that attackers use phishing sites to collect credentials. This aligns with the technique T1586-Compromise Accounts, as it involves collecting sensitive information.
- **Locking Out Original Owners**: The final step of changing account passwords to lock out the original owners is a form of account compromise, which aligns with T1586-Compromise Accounts.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Impersonation**: The attackers use impersonation (T1656) to deliver phishing messages.
2. **Phishing Sites**: The phishing sites (part of T1586-Compromise Accounts) are used to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials.
3. **Account Compromise**: After collecting the credentials, the attackers change the account passwords to lock out the original owners, which is another form of account compromise (T1586-Compromise Accounts).

Given the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, the most plausible sequence aligns with the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A
