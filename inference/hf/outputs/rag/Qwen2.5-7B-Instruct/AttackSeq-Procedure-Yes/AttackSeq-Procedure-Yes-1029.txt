Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Gamaredon's malware:
1. Deploying malware to search for sensitive documents.
2. Taking screenshots during the collection phase.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the exfiltration phase:
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated processes for exfiltrating data.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C&C) channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This TTP suggests that the malware has the capability to automatically exfiltrate data without manual intervention. This aligns well with the question's scenario where the malware is expected to automatically upload harvested documents.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This TTP indicates that the exfiltration is done through a C&C channel, which is consistent with the question's mention of uploading to a C&C server.

Given that both TTPs support the idea of automated and C&C-based exfiltration, it is highly plausible that Gamaredon's modules would follow such a sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include searching for and collecting sensitive documents, and taking screenshots.
- The related TTPs, T1020 and T1041, both support the idea of automated and C&C-based exfiltration.
- Both TTPs suggest that the malware would automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
