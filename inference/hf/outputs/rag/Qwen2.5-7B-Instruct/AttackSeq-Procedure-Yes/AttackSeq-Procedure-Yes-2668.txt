Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the OceanLotus backdoor:
1. Achieving persistence by creating a Launch Agent.
2. Copying itself to a location based on the user's UID in `~/Library/OpenSSL/` or `/Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs`.

The question then asks if it is likely that the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques used by the OceanLotus backdoor:
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent**: This technique involves using a Launch Agent to gain persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves hiding or disguising the malicious task or service to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent**: This technique is the same as the one mentioned in the question, confirming the use of a Launch Agent for persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to use persistence and may employ techniques to evade detection. However, the question specifically asks about the next steps after achieving persistence, which are:
- Surveying the victim's computer.
- Sending encrypted details about system information to its command and control server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The OceanLotus backdoor has already achieved persistence by creating a Launch Agent and copying itself to a specific location.
2. **Surveying the Victim's Computer**: This is a common next step for a backdoor to gather information about the victim's system.
3. **Sending Encrypted Details**: After gathering information, it is likely that the backdoor will send this information to its command and control server to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

Given the context and the typical behavior of sophisticated backdoors like OceanLotus, it is highly plausible that the backdoor would perform these actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
