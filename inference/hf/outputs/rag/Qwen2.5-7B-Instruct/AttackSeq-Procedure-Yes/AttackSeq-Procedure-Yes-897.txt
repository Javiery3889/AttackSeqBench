Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the delivery of KerrDown via malicious Microsoft Office Documents or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading. It then asks if the Office document is likely to contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using a malicious file to deliver malware. This aligns with the scenario where KerrDown is delivered via a malicious Office document or RAR archive.
- The question specifically mentions that the document enables DLL side-loading, which is a technique used to execute code in the context of a legitimate process, often to evade detection.
- The question also mentions the use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture. Base64 encoding is a common method to obfuscate the payload and make it harder to detect.
- The question also mentions an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. This is a common social engineering tactic to trick users into enabling macros, which can then execute the malicious payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario described in the question involves a sophisticated attack that uses social engineering (tricking the user to enable macros) and technical obfuscation (base64 encoding and DLL side-loading).
- The use of an image file to instruct the user to enable macros is a plausible social engineering tactic to bypass security measures.
- The base64 encoding and DLL side-loading are technical methods to ensure the payload is executed in a way that is difficult to detect and block.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Office document will indeed contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
