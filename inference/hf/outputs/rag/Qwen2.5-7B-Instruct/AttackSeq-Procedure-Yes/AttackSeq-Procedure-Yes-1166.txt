### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Longhorn gains initial access via a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document, leading to the infection of a target with Plexor malware.
   - The question then asks whether Longhorn's subsequent actions are likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents, specifically before performing detailed system fingerprinting.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves the exploitation of a vulnerability to run malicious code on a target system. This aligns with the initial access via a zero-day vulnerability.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the target system to understand its configuration and capabilities.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about files and directories on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of Longhorn following guidelines to avoid detection before performing detailed system fingerprinting.
   - The Vault 7 documents, which are known for detailing CIA's hacking tools and techniques, often include methods to avoid detection. This suggests that Longhorn, as a sophisticated actor, would likely follow such guidelines.
   - Detailed system fingerprinting (T1082 and T1083) is a critical step in understanding the target environment, which could be risky if not done carefully to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the Vault 7 documents and the need to avoid detection, it is highly plausible that Longhorn would follow such guidelines before performing detailed system fingerprinting.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the actor taking steps to avoid detection before conducting detailed system discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
