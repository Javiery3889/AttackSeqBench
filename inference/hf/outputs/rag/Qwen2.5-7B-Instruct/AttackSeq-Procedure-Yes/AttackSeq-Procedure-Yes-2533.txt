Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deep Panda exfiltrates data over the C2 channel using the Milestone backdoor.
2. The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor previously ensured initial access by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the methods and techniques used by threat actors to initially gain access to a network or system.
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique)**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly-facing applications to gain initial access.

Given that the question asks about the likelihood of the threat actor using the Log4Shell vulnerability to gain initial access, we need to consider if this aligns with the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question is asking about the initial access method used by the threat actor.
2. **Exploit Public-Facing Application**: The Log4Shell vulnerability is a known exploit for the Log4j library, which is often used in publicly-facing applications, such as web servers.
3. **Context of Deep Panda**: Deep Panda is known to use sophisticated methods for initial access and data exfiltration. Exploiting a widely-known vulnerability like Log4Shell could be a plausible method for gaining initial access, especially if the target is a publicly-facing application like VMware Horizon.

### Final Answer
Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, it is plausible that the threat actor used the Log4Shell vulnerability to gain initial access. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
