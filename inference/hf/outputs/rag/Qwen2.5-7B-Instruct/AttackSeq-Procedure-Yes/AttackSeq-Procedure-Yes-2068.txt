Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initial access via spear-phishing emails.
2. Execution of Trojan.Vcrodat.
3. Exploitation of vulnerabilities.
4. Utilization of Mimikatz for credential harvesting.
5. Compromising additional machines to escalate privileges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the initial access and execution phases:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via email.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious document or image via email.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file, which aligns with the execution of Trojan.Vcrodat.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions spear-phishing emails, which aligns with the related TTPs T1566.001 and T1566.002.
- **Execution**: The execution of Trojan.Vcrodat is mentioned, which aligns with the related TTP T1204.002.
- **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: This is a common step in the attack sequence, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **Utilization of Mimikatz for Credential Harvesting**: Mimikatz is a tool used for credential harvesting, which is a common technique in post-exploitation phases.
- **Compromising Additional Machines to Escalate Privileges**: This is a typical step in the attack lifecycle to gain more control over the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes initial access via spear-phishing, execution of a Trojan, and then credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
- The related TTPs confirm the initial access and execution phases but do not explicitly mention exploitation of vulnerabilities or the use of Mimikatz.
- However, the question asks if Whitefly is likely to perform these actions, and based on the typical behavior of such threats, it is reasonable to assume that they would follow a standard post-exploitation sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
