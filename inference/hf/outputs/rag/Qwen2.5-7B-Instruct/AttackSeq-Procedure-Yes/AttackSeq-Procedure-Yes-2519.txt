Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the BlueDelta campaign:
1. Exploitation of Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access.
2. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question mentions exploiting Roundcube mail servers for initial access, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access to a system. The question mentions exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access:** The campaign uses CVE-2020-35730 to exploit Roundcube mail servers. This is a valid method for gaining initial access to the target's network.
2. **Discovery Activities:** After gaining initial access, the campaign exploits vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather information. This is a common follow-up step in many cyber attacks, where the adversary uses the initial foothold to explore the network and gather information.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in the question.

Final Answer: A
