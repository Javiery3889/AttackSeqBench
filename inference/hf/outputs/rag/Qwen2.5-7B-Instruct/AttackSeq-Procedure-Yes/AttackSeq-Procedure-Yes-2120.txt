Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. **Fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader** (Execution, T1055)
2. **Software discovery using WMIC** (Execution, T1203)
3. **Lateral movement using RDP** (Lateral Movement, T1021)

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** (This is relevant to the final step of RDP usage for lateral movement)
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Software Discovery** (This is relevant to the step of using WMIC for software discovery)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After using DESLoader for fileless implants, the attackers would likely perform software discovery using WMIC to gather information about the environment. Following this, they would use RDP for lateral movement to target additional servers.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the attackers did not perform software discovery using WMIC and directly used RDP for lateral movement, it would not follow the logical sequence implied by the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is logical and follows the typical attack pattern of gathering information (software discovery) before moving laterally.
- The related TTPs support the use of WMIC for software discovery and RDP for lateral movement.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: Yes**
