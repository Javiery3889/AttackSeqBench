Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by SLUB malware:
1. **Collection Phase**: The malware collects system information and captures screenshots.
2. **Interaction Phase**: The malware interacts with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase.
3. **Exfiltration Phase**: The question asks if the malware is likely to exfiltrate the collected data (system information and screenshots) via the same Mattermost server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic**: Exfiltration
- **Technique**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration. Given that the malware is already interacting with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase, it is plausible that the same server could be used for exfiltration as well.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Collection Phase**: The malware has already collected system information and screenshots.
2. **Interaction Phase**: The malware is using a Mattermost server for interaction, which suggests a C2 channel.
3. **Exfiltration Phase**: Given that the Mattermost server is already being used for communication, it is reasonable to assume that the same server could be used for exfiltrating the collected data.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed exfiltrate the collected data via the same Mattermost server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
