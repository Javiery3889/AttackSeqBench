Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. SparrowDoor is used for communication with the C&C server using HTTPS.
2. Multi-byte XOR keys are used for encrypted communications.
3. The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the Command and Control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel that is not a C2 channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which states that data can be exfiltrated over the C&C channel.
  - SparrowDoor is being used for C&C communication, and the question asks if data is likely to be exfiltrated over the same channel.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that data is not exfiltrated over the C&C channel, which contradicts the TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where SparrowDoor is used for C&C communication, and multi-byte XOR keys are used for encryption.
- The related TTPs confirm that data can be exfiltrated over the C&C channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
- Therefore, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would use SparrowDoor to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
