### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker uses API hooking to evade detection.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor configuration will include an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique is directly related to the use of encryption or encoding to protect data, which aligns with the question's mention of an encryption/decryption key.
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique is about evading detection by blocking indicators, which is also mentioned in the question but does not directly relate to the encryption of communication data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking about the inclusion of an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address, which is more closely aligned with the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique.
   - The use of encryption/decryption keys and XOR encryption for C&C server addresses is a common practice in malware to ensure that the communication remains undetected and secure.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: A: Yes
