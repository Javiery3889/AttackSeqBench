Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after the discovery phase:
1. Attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.
2. They then exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement.
3. Finally, they install additional persistence points on new systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
- **Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** is directly related to the question, as it involves using remote services to move laterally within a network.
- The sequence described in the question logically follows the typical attack lifecycle:
  1. Discovery (gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data)
  2. Lateral Movement (using remote services to move to new systems)
  3. Persistence (installing additional persistence points on new systems)

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it is likely that after gaining knowledge, attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing persistence points.
- The related TTPs confirm that exploitation of remote services is a common technique for lateral movement.
- The logical sequence of actions (discovery -> lateral movement -> persistence) aligns with the typical attack pattern.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
