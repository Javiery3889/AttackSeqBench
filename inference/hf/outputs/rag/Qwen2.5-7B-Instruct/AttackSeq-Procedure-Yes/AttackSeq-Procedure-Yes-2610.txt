Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Sednit group has already established a victim's machine as a valid target by delivering a Flash exploit via a spear-phishing email.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will use the resulting malware to utilize an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit and enable persistence on the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The tactic mentioned is "Privilege Escalation," which aligns with the question's focus on gaining higher-level access on the victim's machine.
   - The technique mentioned is "T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation," which directly pertains to the use of exploits to escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of the group using an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit and enabling persistence.
   - Given the tactic of "Privilege Escalation" and the technique of "T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation," it is highly plausible that the group would attempt to escalate privileges and ensure persistence on the victim's machine.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Sednit group is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, which often involve multiple steps to gain and maintain access.
   - Establishing a foothold through a Flash exploit is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks.
   - Once the initial exploit is successful, the group would likely seek to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system.
   - Enabling persistence ensures that the group can maintain access even if the victim's system is rebooted or if the malware is detected and removed.
   - The related TTPs specifically mention privilege escalation, which supports the likelihood of the group attempting to escalate privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
