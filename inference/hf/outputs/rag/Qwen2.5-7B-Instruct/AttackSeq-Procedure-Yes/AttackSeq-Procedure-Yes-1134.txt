Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where persistence is established using a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter' to execute the SideTwist payload every 5 minutes. The question then asks if it is likely that the SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C server (sarmsoftware[.]com) using encrypted HTTP channels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
  - This TTP is directly related to the persistence mechanism described in the question, where a scheduled task is used to execute the payload.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
  - This TTP is related to the exfiltration of data, which could be a potential next step after persistence is established.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels.
  - Given that the question does not provide any information that contradicts this, and considering that encrypted communication is a common practice to avoid detection, this answer is plausible.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the SideTwist backdoor did not communicate with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels.
  - Without any specific information in the question that indicates the use of unencrypted channels, this answer seems less likely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence using a scheduled task, which aligns with the TTP T1053.005-Scheduled Task.
- The question does not provide any information that suggests the use of unencrypted channels for communication.
- Encrypted communication is a common practice in malware to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels.

**Final Answer: A**
