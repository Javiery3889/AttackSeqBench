Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where scanning tools and commands are used to discover open ports and services on a target network. It then asks if it is likely that the adversary (Earth Lusca) will exploit these services and perform lateral movement by establishing network tunnels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the scanning activities described in the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying open ports and services on a network, which also aligns with the scanning activities mentioned.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after discovering open ports and services, the adversary will exploit these services and perform lateral movement.
  - Given the techniques T1018 and T1046, which are focused on discovery, it is logical to assume that the next step would be to exploit the discovered services and move laterally within the network.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the adversary will not exploit the discovered services and perform lateral movement.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of an adversary who has discovered open services and ports. It is unlikely that the adversary would simply stop after discovery without attempting to exploit the discovered services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where scanning tools and commands are used to discover open ports and services.
- The related TTPs (T1018 and T1046) indicate that the adversary is in the discovery phase.
- The natural progression from discovery to exploitation and lateral movement is a common and expected behavior in cyber attacks.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that the adversary will exploit the discovered services and perform lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
