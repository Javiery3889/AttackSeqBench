Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Infamous Chisel's netd component:
1. Enumerates multiple directories and gathers system information during the discovery phase.
2. Is asked whether it will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is a technique that involves gathering information about files and directories on the target system. This is consistent with the first part of the question where the netd component is described as enumerating directories and gathering system information.
- The question then asks if the component will automatically collect files based on a predefined list of file extensions. This is a different action and falls under the collection phase, which is not directly covered by the T1083-File and Directory Discovery technique.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Discovery Phase**: The netd component is described as enumerating directories and gathering system information. This aligns with the T1083-File and Directory Discovery technique.
2. **Collection Phase**: The question asks if the component will automatically collect files based on a predefined list of file extensions. This is a different action and not directly covered by the T1083-File and Directory Discovery technique.
3. **Plausibility**: While the netd component is gathering system information, there is no direct indication in the provided TTPs that it will automatically collect files based on a predefined list of file extensions.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not directly support the automatic collection of files based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
