Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The Helminth Trojan agent uses a customized version of Mimikatz to gather information.
2. The DnE1.Ps1 file will use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script for execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS queries for command and control communications.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves collecting data automatically.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1082-System Information Discovery**: This is relevant to the initial step where the Helminth Trojan uses Mimikatz to gather information.
- **Technique T1119-Automated Collection**: This is relevant to the collection of data, which is part of the initial step.
- **Technique T1071.004-DNS**: This is directly relevant to the second step where the DnE1.Ps1 file uses DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Helminth Trojan uses Mimikatz to gather information, which aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery.
2. The DnE1.Ps1 file then uses DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script, which aligns with T1071.004-DNS.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the DnE1.Ps1 file will indeed use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script for execution.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
