Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by malware:
1. Ensures persistence by copying itself into the System32 directory and creating services.
2. Disables the system firewall and AhnLab firewall.
3. Turns off the Windows Security Center service.
4. Gathers information about the infected computer, including system and user names.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall to evade detection and maintain access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service)**: The malware ensures persistence by copying itself into the System32 directory and creating services. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
- **Defense Evasion (T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall)**: The malware disables the system firewall and AhnLab firewall. This aligns with the second part of the sequence.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question includes disabling the system firewall and AhnLab firewall, which is directly related to the TTP T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall.
- The question also mentions turning off the Windows Security Center service, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided related TTPs. However, disabling the firewall is a common step in evading security measures, and turning off the Security Center service is another way to disable a security component.
- Gathering information about the infected computer is a common post-exploitation activity, but it is not directly related to the provided TTPs.

Given the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1543.003-Windows Service (Persistence)
2. T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall (Defense Evasion)

Since the question asks if the malware is likely to disable the system firewall and AhnLab firewall, and this is directly aligned with the provided TTPs, the answer is:

**Final Answer: Yes**
