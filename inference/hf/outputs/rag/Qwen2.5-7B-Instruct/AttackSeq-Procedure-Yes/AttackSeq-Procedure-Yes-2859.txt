Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Scanning the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
2. Using Suckfly to transfer malware laterally across the network.
3. The Nidiran backdoor communicating the victim’s network details to C&C domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves using tools to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying open ports and services on hosts within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This is the initial step where the attacker scans for hosts with specific open ports. This aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Technique T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This is the next step where the attacker uses tools to move laterally across the network. This aligns with the second part of the question.
- **Nidiran backdoor communicating to C&C domains**: This is a separate step that occurs after the lateral movement and tool transfer, which is consistent with the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker first scans the network for hosts with specific open ports (T1046-Network Service Discovery).
2. The attacker then uses Suckfly to transfer malware laterally across the network (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer).
3. After the malware is transferred, the Nidiran backdoor communicates the victim’s network details to the C&C domains.

Given this sequence, the most plausible answer is that the attacker will indeed use Suckfly to transfer malware laterally across the network before the Nidiran backdoor communicates the victim’s network details to the C&C domains.

### Final Answer: A
