Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by a backdoor (Milestone) that includes:
1. Discovering system information.
2. Capturing the screen.
3. Exfiltrating data over a C2 (Command and Control) channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This technique specifically involves the use of a C2 channel for data exfiltration. It aligns with the third step in the sequence described in the question.
- **Discovering System Information and Capturing the Screen**: These actions are preparatory steps that would likely precede the exfiltration of data. They are not directly related to the TTPs provided, but they are part of the overall attack sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Discovering System Information**: This is a preparatory step that helps the backdoor understand the environment it is operating in.
2. **Capturing the Screen**: This is another preparatory step that could provide additional context or evidence for the exfiltrated data.
3. **Exfiltrating Data Over the C2 Channel**: This is the final step in the sequence, which is directly supported by the provided TTP (T1041).

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel after the backdoor has discovered system information and captured the screen. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
