Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Naikon APT group has gathered system and network information using the Aria-body backdoor during the Discovery tactic. The question then asks whether, during the Command and Control stage, the group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols, which explicitly mentions the use of web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the group does not use HTTP and TCP for command and control, which contradicts the information provided by the related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage.
- The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols directly supports the use of web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control.
- There is no information provided that suggests the use of non-standard ports (T1571-Non-Standard Port) over web protocols in this context.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage.

**Final Answer: A**
