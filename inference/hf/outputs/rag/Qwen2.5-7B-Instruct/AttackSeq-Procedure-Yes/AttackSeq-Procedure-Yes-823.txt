### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of FIN4 using C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials and relying on Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase.
   - The sequence of TTPs involves:
     - Transmitting stolen credentials to C2 servers (during the credential access phase).
     - Collecting these credentials (during the command and control phase).
     - Using Tor for anonymous communication (during the command and control phase).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control. While this is a common technique, it does not directly address the use of Tor for anonymous communication.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 traffic. While this can provide some level of anonymity, it is not specifically related to Tor.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric encryption for C2 communications. While this can secure the communication, it does not directly address the use of Tor for anonymity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting credentials and relies on Tor for anonymous communication.
     - Tor is a well-known tool for anonymous communication, often used by APT groups like FIN4 to hide their C2 traffic.
     - The use of C2 servers for collecting credentials is a common practice in APT operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN4 does not use C2 servers for collecting credentials or rely on Tor for anonymous communication.
     - This is less likely given the common practices of APT groups like FIN4, who often use a combination of C2 servers and Tor for their operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
