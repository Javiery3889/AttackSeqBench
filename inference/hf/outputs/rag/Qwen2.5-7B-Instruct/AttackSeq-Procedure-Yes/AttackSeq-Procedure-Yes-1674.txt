Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems to identify potential targets or to understand the network environment.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or by exploiting a vulnerability in a legitimate website.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise)**: This TTP aligns with the use of the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites. This is a common method for initial compromise where attackers exploit vulnerabilities or trick users into visiting malicious sites.
- **Remote System Discovery (T1018)**: This TTP aligns with the use of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView, which is a tool used for gathering information about remote systems, such as discovering and enumerating networked computers.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use the SocGholish framework, which is delivered via compromised legitimate websites. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a network.
2. **Remote System Discovery**: After gaining initial access, the attackers use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView to discover and gather information about remote systems.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the most likely sequence is that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise and then use the Get-NetComputer command for remote system discovery.

Final Answer: A
