Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Discovery using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
2. Lateral movement using RDP with both privileged and non-privileged accounts.
3. Accessing data from Information Repositories.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the domain structure, which aligns with the use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of activities. After discovering Active Directory information, the threat actor would likely use RDP to move laterally, potentially using both privileged and non-privileged accounts to gain access to different parts of the network.
  - The use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP is a common tactic to avoid detection and to gain access to more sensitive information.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of activities. If the threat actor has already discovered Active Directory information, it is highly likely that they would use RDP to move laterally, regardless of the type of accounts used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the threat actor first discovers Active Directory information and then uses RDP to move laterally.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of RDP for lateral movement and the discovery of Active Directory information.
- The use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP is a common and effective tactic to avoid detection and gain access to sensitive information.

**Final Answer: Yes**
