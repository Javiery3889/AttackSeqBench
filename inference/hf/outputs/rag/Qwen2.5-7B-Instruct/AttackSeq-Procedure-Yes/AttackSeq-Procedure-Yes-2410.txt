Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A malicious macro downloads and executes a second-stage downloader.
2. The second-stage downloader fetches an encrypted third-stage payload.
3. The question asks if Lokibot is likely to escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe and then using process hollowing to bypass UAC.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Privilege Escalation (T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control)**: This technique is directly related to the question as it involves bypassing UAC.
- **Defense Evasion (T1055.012-Process Hollowing)**: This technique is also relevant as it involves using process hollowing to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique is specifically about bypassing UAC, which aligns with the question's mention of using process hollowing to bypass UAC.
- **Technique T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique is about executing code in the context of a legitimate process, which is consistent with the question's description of using process hollowing.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Lokibot is known to use various techniques to escalate privileges and evade detection. Injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process like Notepad.exe is a common method to bypass UAC and gain higher privileges. After injecting the malicious DLL, Lokibot can then use process hollowing to execute the payload in the context of the Notepad.exe process, effectively bypassing UAC.

Given the related TTPs and the nature of Lokibot's known behavior, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Lokibot would indeed escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe and then use process hollowing to bypass UAC.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
