Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by a malware named Machete, including stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, and staging them in a temporary folder.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves the use of non-standard ports for command and control (C2) communication to avoid detection.
   - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols like FTP and HTTP for C2 communication.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is detected or blocked.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where the malware first uses standard ports (HTTP and FTP) for communication and then falls back to other channels if necessary.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware might use non-standard ports and fallback channels, but they do not explicitly state that the malware will use standard ports first.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a sequence where the malware initially uses standard ports (HTTP and FTP) and then falls back to other channels.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware might use non-standard ports and fallback channels, but they do not confirm the use of standard ports first.
   - Given the question's phrasing and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware would use standard ports first and then fallback to other channels if necessary.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
