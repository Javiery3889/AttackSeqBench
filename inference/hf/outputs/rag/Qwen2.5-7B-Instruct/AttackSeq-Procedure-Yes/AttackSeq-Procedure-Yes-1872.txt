Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving FIN13:
1. Exploitation of external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
2. Gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase.
3. Employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the Reconnaissance and Execution phases:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique is related to deploying web shells, which aligns with the initial exploitation and deployment of web shells.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique is related to gathering network information, which fits the Reconnaissance phase.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique is related to using a command shell, which aligns with the local command execution and network traffic proxying.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.
  - The related TTPs support this sequence:
    - **T1505.003-Web Shell** for initial deployment.
    - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** for gathering network information.
    - **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell** for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Mandiant will not track FIN13 in the described sequence.
  - This does not align with the provided TTPs, as the sequence described in the question is supported by the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence that includes initial deployment of web shells, followed by gathering network information, and then using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.
- The related TTPs support this sequence, with T1505.003 for web shell deployment, T1016 for network information gathering, and T1059.003 for local command execution.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: Yes**
