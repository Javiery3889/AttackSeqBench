Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Machete uses FTP and HTTP to communicate with its C&C servers and optionally downloads additional files for execution. It then asks if Machete is likely to automatically copy data from all drives in a compromised system to a removable drive if a specific file is present on that drive during its exfiltration phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the scenario where data is copied from a drive to a removable drive.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - This technique involves automated data exfiltration, which fits the context of copying data to a removable drive during the exfiltration phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Machete would automatically copy data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present. This aligns with the TTPs related to data collection from removable media (T1025) and automated exfiltration (T1020).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Machete would not perform such an action, which does not align with the described TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where data is copied to a removable drive during the exfiltration phase.
- The related TTPs indicate that the malware (Machete) is capable of collecting data from removable media (T1025) and exfiltrating it automatically (T1020).
- Given that the question specifies a specific file on the drive triggering the action, it is plausible that the malware would perform the described action as part of its automated exfiltration process.

### Final Answer: A
