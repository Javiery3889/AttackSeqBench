Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - PROMETHIUM is a malware that searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives.
   - The archives are then encoded with an unusual scheme and split into chunks before being exfiltrated to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves archiving collected data, which aligns with PROMETHIUM's behavior of compressing files.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which could imply an unusual encoding or compression scheme.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique involves splitting data to avoid size limits during exfiltration, which aligns with the behavior of splitting archives into chunks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the behavior described in the question. PROMETHIUM compresses files, which is covered by T1560. The unusual encoding and splitting into chunks are covered by T1560.003 and T1030, respectively.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the described behavior. If PROMETHIUM did not encode the archives with an unusual scheme or split them into chunks, it would not match the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - PROMETHIUM's behavior of compressing files aligns with T1560.
   - The unusual encoding of the archives aligns with T1560.003.
   - Splitting the archives into chunks aligns with T1030.
   - All these behaviors are consistent with the question's description.

**Final Answer: A**
