Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in the Collection and Exfiltration phases.
   - In the Collection phase, Infamous Chisel automatically collects files based on a predefined list of file extensions and gathers files from application and data directories.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the netd component will exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections in the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the question's context of automatic collection and exfiltration.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for exfiltration, which could include methods like Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automated collection of data, which aligns with the initial part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is relevant here, as it involves using a C2 channel for exfiltration, which could include methods like Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration also supports the idea of automated exfiltration, which fits with the automated collection described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where files are automatically collected and then exfiltrated.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1041, suggest the use of C2 channels for exfiltration, which can include methods like Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
   - Given that the question asks about the likelihood of using these specific methods, and the related TTPs support the use of C2 channels for exfiltration, it is reasonable to conclude that the netd component is likely to use these methods.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
