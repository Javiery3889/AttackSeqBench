Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: 
     1. Bypassing logging on the infected machine.
     2. Using PowerShell commands.
     3. Deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool.
     4. Extracting credentials.
     5. Proceeding with command and control communications using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves the attacker using keylogging to capture credentials. However, the question does not mention keylogging but rather a credential dumping tool.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves the attacker extracting credentials from files. This aligns with the question's mention of a credential dumping tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin will bypass logging, use PowerShell commands, deploy DarkComet, extract credentials, and then use POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for command and control.
     - The related TTPs do not directly mention bypassing logging or using PowerShell commands, but they do align with the credential extraction part.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin will not follow the described sequence of actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that includes bypassing logging, which is not directly supported by the related TTPs.
   - The related TTPs do support the credential extraction part, but they do not explicitly mention the bypassing of logging or the use of PowerShell commands.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question, while plausible, is not directly supported by the provided related TTPs.

**Final Answer: B**
