Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using backdoors to list interesting files for future exfiltration.
2. Taking screenshots every minute.
3. Employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated exfiltration of data.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Backdoors to list files (Exfiltration)**: This is consistent with T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
- **Taking screenshots every minute**: This is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs but can be inferred as a method to gather additional data for exfiltration.
- **HTTP and HTTPS for command and control**: This is consistent with T1071.001-Web Protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Backdoors to list files**: This aligns with T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
2. **Taking screenshots every minute**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a plausible method to gather additional data for exfiltration.
3. **HTTP and HTTPS for command and control**: This aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Automated exfiltration of files (T1020)
- Taking screenshots (inferred additional data gathering)
- Using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (T1071.001)

### Final Answer: A
