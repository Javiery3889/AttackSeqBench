Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. XAgent app executes by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices.
2. The app is likely to collect a list of processes for discovery.
3. The gathered information, including the processes data, is sent out via HTTP to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network or system. It aligns with the final step of sending the gathered information to the C2 server.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the discovery of running processes on a system. It aligns with the step of collecting a list of processes for discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the app will collect a list of processes and then send the gathered information to the C2 server.
  - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs: T1057-Process Discovery (for collecting processes) and T1020-Automated Exfiltration (for sending the data to the C2 server).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the app will not collect a list of processes or send the gathered information to the C2 server.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the described actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the app first hides and runs in the background, then collects a list of processes, and finally sends the data to the C2 server.
- The related TTPs, T1057-Process Discovery and T1020-Automated Exfiltration, support this sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
