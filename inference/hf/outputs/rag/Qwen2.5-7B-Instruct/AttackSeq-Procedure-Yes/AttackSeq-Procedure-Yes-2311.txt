Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compressing and encrypting large chunks of data.
2. Staging the data for exfiltration.
3. Exfiltrating the processed files to cloud storage web services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
4. Collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
- **Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage** directly relates to the exfiltration of data to cloud storage services, which aligns with the question's description of exfiltrating processed files to cloud storage web services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
- The question also mentions custom-built malware, but the related TTPs do not specifically mention the use of custom-built malware. Instead, they focus on the exfiltration technique to cloud storage.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that includes exfiltrating data to cloud storage services.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the technique of exfiltrating data to cloud storage, which matches the question's description.
- While the question mentions custom-built malware, the related TTPs do not provide information about the use of custom-built malware in this context.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the exfiltration to cloud storage, as described by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
