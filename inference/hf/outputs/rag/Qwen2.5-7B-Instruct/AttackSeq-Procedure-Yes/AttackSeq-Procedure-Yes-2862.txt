Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a malware:
1. Redirected execution to a malicious code.
2. Decrypted a two-stage payload.
3. Attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER` and modifying `CBkdr.dll`.
4. Established a Command and Control (C2) channel using an HTTPS POST request with system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding the C2 traffic to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages to establish and maintain C2.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique involves embedding payloads within legitimate files to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Zeroing out the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER` and modifying `CBkdr.dll`**: This action is a form of **Defense Evasion** (T1027.009-Embedded Payloads). It is a technique to hide the malicious payload within a legitimate file, making it harder for antivirus software to detect.
- **Establishing a C2 channel using an HTTPS POST request**: This is a **Command and Control** (T1132.001-Standard Encoding) technique, as it involves encoding the C2 traffic to evade detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions that include evading detection and establishing a C2 channel.
2. Zeroing out the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER` and modifying `CBkdr.dll` is a technique to evade detection (T1027.009-Embedded Payloads).
3. Establishing a C2 channel using an HTTPS POST request is a technique to maintain communication (T1132.001-Standard Encoding).
4. Both of these actions are consistent with the related TTPs provided.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware payload did attempt to evade detection and establish a C2 channel.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
