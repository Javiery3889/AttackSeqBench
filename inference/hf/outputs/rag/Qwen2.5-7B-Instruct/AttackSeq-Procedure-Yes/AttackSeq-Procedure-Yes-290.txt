### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Dropping Elephant.
   - The backdoor downloads encoded blobs, which are then decoded into PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
   - The question asks if the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automated collection of data, which aligns with the file-stealer module's function.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating information, which aligns with the backdoor downloading and decoding encoded blobs.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which could be relevant to the file-stealer module's function.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of the file-stealer module iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the file-stealer module is involved in automated collection (T1119) and file and directory discovery (T1083).
   - Given that the file-stealer module is designed for automated collection, it is highly plausible that it would iterate through directories to find and collect files with specific extensions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
