Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Darkhotel APT:
1. Compromising trusted commercial network resources on a global scale.
2. Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code.
3. Employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: This is a common initial access method for APTs, including Darkhotel.
- **Small Downloaders and Zero-Day Exploits**: These are often used to deliver and execute payloads, which aligns with the question's description.
- **Code Signing with Digital Certificates**: This is a technique for defense evasion, as it allows the malware to appear legitimate and evade detection by security systems that rely on digital signatures.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The APT compromises trusted commercial network resources, which is a common entry point.
2. **Delivery of Malware**: Small downloaders and zero-day exploits are used to deliver and execute the malicious code. This is a plausible method for APTs to bypass security measures.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The use of code signing with digital certificates is a technique to evade detection and make the malware appear legitimate. This aligns with the tactic of defense evasion.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the TTPs provided, particularly the use of code signing for defense evasion. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
