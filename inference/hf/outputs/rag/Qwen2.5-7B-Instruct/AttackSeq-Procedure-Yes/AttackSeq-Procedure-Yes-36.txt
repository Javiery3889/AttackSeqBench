Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: social engineering to prompt opening a .src file, displaying a decoy document, and then moving to execute arbitrary code and achieve persistence.
   - The persistence method mentioned is creating a shortcut and naming it "adobe distillist.lnk".

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This TTP involves modifying shortcuts to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This TTP also involves modifying shortcuts, but the context here is privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is specifically about persistence, not privilege escalation.
   - The related TTPs mention "T1547.009-Shortcut Modification" under the Persistence tactic, which aligns with the persistence method described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the malware first gains access through social engineering, then executes arbitrary code, and finally achieves persistence by creating a shortcut.
   - The related TTPs confirm that shortcut modification is a technique used for persistence.
   - The question does not mention any privilege escalation, so the related TTPs for privilege escalation are not directly relevant to the persistence aspect of the question.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, it is indeed likely that the KONNI malware will move to execute arbitrary code and then achieve persistence through shortcut modification.
   - Therefore, the answer is: "Final Answer: A: Yes"
