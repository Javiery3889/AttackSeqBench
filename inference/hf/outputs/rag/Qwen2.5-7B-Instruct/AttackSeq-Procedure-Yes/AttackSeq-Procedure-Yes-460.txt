Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Hidden Cobra:
1. They used the Bankshot malware implant to collect information during the reconnaissance phase.
2. The question asks if it is likely that they would proceed to distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves the use of malicious domains to support the attack.
- **T1584.001-Domains**: This technique also involves the use of malicious domains, but it is more specific to the creation and use of domains to support the attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1583.001-Domains**: This technique is more general and can be applied to various types of attacks, including the use of a domain that resembles a cryptocurrency-lending platform.
- **T1584.001-Domains**: This technique is more specific and might be used in a scenario where the attackers are specifically creating a domain to support their attack.

Given that the question mentions a domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform, T1583.001-Domains is more aligned with this specific scenario. The use of a domain that mimics a legitimate service (like a cryptocurrency-lending platform) is a common tactic to trick users into visiting the malicious site and downloading the malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the likelihood of Hidden Cobra using a domain that mimics a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1583.001-Domains, support the use of such a domain.
- The domain mimicking a cryptocurrency-lending platform is a plausible and effective tactic for distributing malware.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Hidden Cobra would indeed proceed to distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
