### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious XLS attachment uses a VB macro to silently download and execute a malicious MSI package.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** T1218.007-Msiexec - This technique involves using the `msiexec` command to execute MSI packages, which can be used to evade detection.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder - This technique involves creating registry entries to ensure that malware runs at startup.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This technique involves creating files in the Startup folder or other locations that are executed at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** and **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** are both related to persistence and involve creating files or registry entries that ensure the malware runs at startup.
   - **T1218.007-Msiexec** is related to the execution of MSI packages but does not directly address the persistence mechanism through LNK files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - While the MSI package can be used to install other files or registry entries for persistence, the specific question asks about installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - The related TTPs suggest that creating files in the Startup folder (T1547.001) or other autostart locations (T1547) is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - Installing an LNK file in the Startup folder is a plausible method for achieving persistence, as it ensures the malware runs at every startup.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
