Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using Mimikatz to enable credential theft.
2. Accessing the Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.
3. Deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file.
4. Logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts.
5. Exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS**: This technique involves accessing the NTDS.DIT file to extract credentials.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid user accounts to gain access to the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Mimikatz and NTDS.DIT**: The use of Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access the NTDS.DIT file aligns with the TTPs related to credential access and initial access.
- **Citrix Servers and Valid User Accounts**: The question asks if APT10 will log in to the network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts, which aligns with the TTP T1078-Valid Accounts.
- **Lateral Movement and Working Hours**: The question also mentions lateral movement and logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours. This is a plausible behavior for APT10, as they often exhibit patterns consistent with the time zones of their targets.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Access**: The use of Mimikatz and accessing the NTDS.DIT file is a common TTP for APT10.
2. **Initial Access**: Using valid user accounts to log in via Citrix servers is a TTP that aligns with the related TTPs.
3. **Lateral Movement**: APT10 is known for their sophisticated lateral movement techniques, often using valid credentials and timing their activities to match the working hours of their targets.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is consistent with the described actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
