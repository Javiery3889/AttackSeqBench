Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.
2. Using a backdoor connection to a command-and-control (C2) server.
3. Injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is related to the initial access via exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly relevant to the supply chain attack described.
- **T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This technique directly relates to the infiltration of devices with firmware backdoors, which is the first step in the sequence.
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which aligns with the backdoor connection to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After exploiting the supply chain to install firmware backdoors, the malware would likely use a backdoor connection to a C2 server to manage the compromised devices and inject additional modules.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the malware does not use a backdoor connection to a C2 server, it would not be able to manage the compromised devices and inject additional modules.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the malware first exploits supply chain vulnerabilities to install firmware backdoors.
- The next step is to use a backdoor connection to a C2 server to manage the compromised devices.
- Finally, the malware injects additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1195.003 and T1104, support the use of a backdoor connection to a C2 server as a means to manage the compromised devices.

### Final Answer: Yes
