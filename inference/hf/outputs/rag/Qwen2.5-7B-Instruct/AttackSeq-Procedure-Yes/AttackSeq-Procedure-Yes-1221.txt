Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Compressing proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase.
2. Using custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox.
3. Employing cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This TTP matches the use of WinRAR for compressing data.
- **Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This TTP aligns with exfiltrating files to Dropbox.
- **Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This TTP suggests using a custom method for archiving, which could be relevant if the attackers use custom malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the files.
  - The related TTPs support the use of custom methods for archiving (T1560.003) and exfiltration to cloud storage (T1567.002).
  - However, the question specifically mentions using custom malware for exfiltration, which is not directly supported by the related TTPs. The related TTPs focus on the use of utilities and custom methods, but not specifically on custom malware for exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers will not use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the files.
  - This does not align with the question, as the question explicitly mentions the use of custom malware and cURL for Windows.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence involving custom malware for exfiltration, which is not directly supported by the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs suggest the use of utilities and custom methods, but not specifically custom malware for exfiltration.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not align with the use of custom malware for exfiltration as described in the question.

**Final Answer: B**
