Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attacker has already evaded defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts.
2. The next step is to download additional malware.
3. The malware in question is the Dropping Elephant backdoor.
4. The question asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Persistence** - This suggests the malware is designed to maintain a foothold on the system.
- **Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions** - This indicates the malware might use browser extensions to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Credential Access** - This suggests the malware is designed to steal credentials.
- **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers** - This specifically indicates the malware is designed to steal credentials from web browsers, including Google Chrome.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This aligns with the Tactic: Credential Access and the specific Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers. The Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal credentials from web browsers, including Google Chrome.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This does not align with the provided TTPs. If the malware is designed to steal credentials, it is unlikely to not perform this action.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Dropping Elephant backdoor is designed to maintain persistence and steal credentials.
- The specific technique T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers indicates that the malware is designed to steal credentials from web browsers, including Google Chrome.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials.

**Final Answer: A**
