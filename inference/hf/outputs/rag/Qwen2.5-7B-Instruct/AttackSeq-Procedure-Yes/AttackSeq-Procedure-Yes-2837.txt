Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware has already discovered system information and process lists using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves the methods used by adversaries to maintain access to a network and execute their objectives.
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols** - This technique involves the use of web protocols (like HTTPS) for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery** - This tactic involves the methods used by adversaries to gather information about the network and systems.
   - **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery** - This technique involves the discovery of processes on the system, which is what the malware has already done.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The malware has already performed process discovery, which is a step in the attack sequence.
   - The question is asking about the next likely step, which is the use of HTTPS for C2 communications.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1071.001-Web Protocols, directly address the use of web protocols for C2, which aligns with the question.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware has already gathered system and process information, which is a preparatory step.
   - The next logical step in maintaining a covert and secure communication channel would be to use HTTPS for C2 operations.
   - The related TTPs, specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols, support the use of HTTPS for C2, which is a common and effective method to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
