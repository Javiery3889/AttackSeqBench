### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a loader DLL is used to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory. This is a common technique for defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if the Lazarus group is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with the C2 server, which is a common practice to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` tool to execute code, which is a method for loading and executing code in memory without writing it to disk, aiding in defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves decrypting or deobfuscating files or information, which aligns with the use of a loader DLL to decrypt and execute the backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Lazarus group is known to use techniques for both defense evasion and command and control.
   - The use of a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory is a form of defense evasion.
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the backdoors would then connect to C2 servers to receive commands and conduct activities, as this is a standard practice in cyber operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
