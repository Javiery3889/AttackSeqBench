Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via a legitimate application's automatic update mechanism.
2. Persistence through the registry's RUN key for configuration updates.
3. The question then asks if WinDealer will use UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 for Command and Control (C2) communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the Command and Control (C2) communication:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of protocols other than HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS for C2 communication to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, as both T1571 and T1095 suggest the use of non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols for C2 communication.
  - UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 are non-standard ports, which fits the T1571 technique.
  - The use of these specific ports also suggests the use of a non-application layer protocol, which aligns with T1095.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the techniques that suggest the use of non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where WinDealer is using a legitimate application's update mechanism for initial access and maintaining persistence through the registry's RUN key.
- The related TTPs indicate that non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols are commonly used for C2 communication to evade detection.
- UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 are non-standard ports, which aligns with the T1571 technique.
- The use of these specific ports also suggests the use of a non-application layer protocol, which aligns with the T1095 technique.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that WinDealer will use UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A**
