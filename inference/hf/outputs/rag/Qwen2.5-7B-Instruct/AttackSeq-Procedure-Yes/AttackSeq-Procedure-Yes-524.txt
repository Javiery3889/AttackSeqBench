Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by INOCNATION malware:
1. XOR obfuscation
2. Sandbox detection
3. String stacking obfuscation
4. Encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections
5. Use of Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control communications

The question asks whether the malware is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control communications after employing the mentioned obfuscation techniques.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control (C2) communications. This aligns with the use of HTTPS for C2.
- **T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography, which can be part of the SSL/TLS protocol for secure communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of encrypted HTTPS (T1071.001) and the use of standard SSL/TLS libraries (which often involve asymmetric cryptography, T1573.002).
  - The obfuscation techniques (XOR, sandbox detection, string stacking) are used to evade detection, and the use of HTTPS and standard SSL/TLS libraries would provide a secure and stealthy channel for C2 communications.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware does not use encrypted HTTPS or standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications, which contradicts the related TTPs and the typical behavior of sophisticated malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware employs various obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
- The use of encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections (T1071.001) and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries (which often involve asymmetric cryptography, T1573.002) is a common and effective method for secure and stealthy C2 communications.
- The related TTPs support the use of these techniques for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: Yes**
