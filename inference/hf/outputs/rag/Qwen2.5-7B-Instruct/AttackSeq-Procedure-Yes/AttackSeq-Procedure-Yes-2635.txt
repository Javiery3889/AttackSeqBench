Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Machete malware:
1. Discovery of newly inserted devices.
2. Producing file listings for exfiltration.
3. Gathering browser data.
4. Utilizing screen capture for data collection.
5. Leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the exfiltration techniques used:
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the established C2 channel for data exfiltration.
- **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves using unencrypted protocols (FTP and HTTP) for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about using the established C2 channel for exfiltration. It does not mention screen capture as a part of the exfiltration process.
- **Technique T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves using unencrypted protocols (FTP and HTTP) for data exfiltration. It does not explicitly mention screen capture either.

Given the sequence described in the question, the malware first performs various data collection activities (discovery, file listings, browser data, and screen capture) and then uses FTP and HTTP for exfiltration. The related TTPs do not directly mention screen capture as part of the exfiltration process, but they do mention using unencrypted protocols for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the malware is likely to utilize screen capture as part of data collection before leveraging FTP and HTTP for communication with C2 servers.
- The related TTPs do not explicitly mention screen capture as part of the exfiltration process.
- The sequence described in the question includes screen capture as part of the data collection phase, which is not directly supported by the related TTPs.

Based on the provided information and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence does not include screen capture as part of the exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: B: No**
