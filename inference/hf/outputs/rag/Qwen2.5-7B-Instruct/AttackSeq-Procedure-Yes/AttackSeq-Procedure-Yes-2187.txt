Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathering network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and tools like PowerSploit.
2. Employing spear phishing emails with malicious links.
3. Injecting malicious JavaScript into websites to achieve initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Network Configurations and Domain Information**: This step is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a common preparatory step before initial access.
- **Spear Phishing Emails with Malicious Links**: This is directly mentioned in the related TTPs as T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
- **Injecting Malicious JavaScript into Websites**: This is also a technique for achieving initial access, but it is not mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Gathering Network Configurations and Domain Information**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, this is a common preparatory step before initial access.
2. **Spear Phishing Emails with Malicious Links**: This is directly supported by the related TTPs.
3. **Injecting Malicious JavaScript into Websites**: This is a technique for initial access but is not mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Gathering network configurations and domain information (though not explicitly mentioned, it is a common preparatory step).
- Spear phishing emails with malicious links (directly supported by the related TTPs).

Since the question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca followed this sequence, and the spear phishing part is directly supported, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
