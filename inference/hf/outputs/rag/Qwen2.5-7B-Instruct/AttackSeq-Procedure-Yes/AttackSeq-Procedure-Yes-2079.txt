Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by RIG EK (an exploit kit) in its operations:
1. **Proxy Servers**: Used to make infections harder to detect.
2. **Exploit Server**: Returns encrypted exploit code.
3. **Custom RC4 Algorithm**: Used for establishing an encrypted channel in command and control operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic**: Command and Control
- **Technique**: T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Proxy Servers**: This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. It aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Exploit Server**: This is a method of delivering the exploit code to the target.
- **Custom RC4 Algorithm**: This is a specific method of encryption. The related TTPs mention symmetric cryptography, which includes RC4 as a symmetric encryption algorithm.

Given that the question specifically mentions a custom version of the RC4 algorithm, and the related TTPs include symmetric cryptography, it is plausible that RIG EK would use a custom RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Proxy Servers**: Used to evade detection, which is a common tactic.
2. **Exploit Server**: Delivers the exploit code, which is a standard method.
3. **Custom RC4 Algorithm**: This aligns with the use of symmetric cryptography, which is a technique mentioned in the related TTPs.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is likely to be true.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
