Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by BBSRAT (a type of backdoor malware):
1. Establishes command and control (C2) communication through HTTP or HTTPS requests.
2. Exfiltrates data about the victim's machine.

The question then asks if it is likely to observe the malware exfiltrating additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the C2 channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique is directly related to the initial C2 communication via HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is related to the exfiltration of data using the established C2 channel.

Given that the malware has already established a C2 channel using HTTP/HTTPS (T1071.001-Web Protocols), it is reasonable to assume that the malware would continue to use this channel for further actions, including exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

The question specifically mentions that the malware exfiltrates data about the victim's machine. It is plausible that the malware would also exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server, as this would be a common method to ensure data integrity and confidentiality during exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has established a C2 channel using HTTP/HTTPS (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
2. The malware exfiltrates data about the victim's machine, which aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.
3. Given the established C2 channel, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would continue to use this channel for further exfiltration activities, including compressed and encrypted data via POST requests.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
