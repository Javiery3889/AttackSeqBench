Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions during the discovery phase:
1. Mapping the network.
2. Infecting further computers using publicly available tools and exploiting vulnerabilities.
3. Compromising additional machines using stolen credentials.
4. Targeting desired data to expand control within the organization.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique is used to gather information about remote systems, which aligns with the network mapping and discovery phase.
- **T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to evade detection, which aligns with the infection and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves stealing credentials, which aligns with the use of stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if it is likely that Whitefly will use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines before targeting desired data.

- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This is the initial phase of gathering information.
- **T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This is used to gain a foothold and evade detection.
- **T1589.001-Credentials**: This is used to gain further access and control.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, it is logical that after gaining initial access and evading detection, the next step would be to use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines. This would help in expanding the control within the organization before targeting the desired data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial phase involves mapping the network and discovering remote systems (T1018).
2. The next phase involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain a foothold (T1211).
3. After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines (T1589.001).
4. Once additional machines are compromised, the final step would be to target the desired data to expand control (not explicitly mentioned in the question but implied).

Based on this reasoning, it is highly likely that Whitefly will use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines before targeting desired data.

### Final Answer: A
