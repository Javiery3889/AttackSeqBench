Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if TG1021 performed reconnaissance using SharpHound and PowerSploit before exploiting a 0-day vulnerability in internet-facing Windows IIS servers. The key points are:
- Initial access is gained by exploiting a 0-day vulnerability in IIS.
- Reconnaissance is performed using SharpHound and PowerSploit.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's network and systems.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **SharpHound**: This tool is used for gathering information about the target's Active Directory environment, which falls under the category of system information discovery (T1082).
- **PowerSploit**: This is a collection of PowerShell-based modules for penetration testing and post-exploitation activities, which can be used for reconnaissance and gathering information (T1018).

Given that the question mentions reconnaissance and the use of these tools, we need to determine if these activities are likely to occur before the initial access exploit.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the initial access is gained by exploiting a 0-day vulnerability in IIS. This is a clear indication of the T1190 technique.
2. **Reconnaissance**: The question asks if reconnaissance was performed using SharpHound and PowerSploit. Both of these tools are used for gathering information about the target, which aligns with the T1082 and T1018 techniques.
3. **Sequence**: It is common in cyber attacks to perform reconnaissance before exploiting a vulnerability. This allows the attacker to gather as much information as possible about the target's environment, which can be used to tailor the attack more effectively.

Based on the above reasoning, it is highly likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance using SharpHound and PowerSploit before gaining initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
