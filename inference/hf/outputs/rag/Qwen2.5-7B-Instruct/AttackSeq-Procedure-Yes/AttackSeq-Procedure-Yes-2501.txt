Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malware is used in the RevengeHotels campaign to capture credentials from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies. It then asks if the malware is likely to monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves monitoring keystrokes to capture sensitive information such as passwords and other credentials.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automated collection of data, which could include various types of data from different sources.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique is similar to the first one and involves capturing credentials through keylogging.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.
  - The related TTPs do not directly mention monitoring documents sent to the printer. However, the techniques related to collection and credential access (keylogging) are more aligned with capturing sensitive information like passwords and credentials.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware is unlikely to monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.
  - Given the related TTPs, the focus is more on capturing credentials and other sensitive information through keylogging and automated collection, rather than specifically targeting documents sent to the printer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs emphasize techniques for capturing credentials and sensitive information through keylogging and automated collection.
- The question asks about monitoring documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data, which is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question aligns more closely with capturing credentials and sensitive information through keylogging and automated collection.

### Final Answer: B
