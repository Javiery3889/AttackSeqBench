Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by FIN13:
1. Uses utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory.
2. Executes passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution.

The question then asks if it is likely that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This technique involves deploying web shells to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **ProcDump and LSASS Memory Dump**: These actions are part of the Credential Access tactic (T1003.001-LSASS Memory). They are used to gather credentials, which is a step in gaining access to the network.
- **BLUEAGAVE Backdoor**: This is a technique used for persistence and command execution (likely under the Persistence tactic, though not explicitly listed in the related TTPs).
- **Web Shells**: These are used for persistence and maintaining access (likely under the Persistence tactic, though not explicitly listed in the related TTPs).

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question does not mention the initial access method, but the use of LSASS memory dump suggests that FIN13 already has some level of access.
2. **Persistence**: The use of BLUEAGAVE and the likelihood of deploying web shells both align with the Persistence tactic.
3. **Web Shells**: Deploying web shells is a common method for maintaining access and persistence in victim networks.

### Final Answer
Given the context of the related TTPs and the actions described, it is plausible that FIN13 would use web shells to establish and maintain persistence in victim networks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
