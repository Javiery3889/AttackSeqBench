Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving PIVY malware:
1. Evading defenses using DLL sideloading.
2. Modifying the configuration of the dropped DLL to confuse tools parsing configuration data.
3. Communicating with Command & Control (C2) servers using application layer protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves impersonating a legitimate protocol or service to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1071.001-Web Protocols, which suggests that the malware is likely to use web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the likelihood of using web protocols for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes evading defenses and modifying configuration data.
- The related TTPs, specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols, indicate that the malware is likely to use web protocols for C2 communication.
- Given the context and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware will indeed communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
