Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon uses an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement via spearphishing emails. It then asks if it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spearphishing email to gain initial access to a target system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves using automated tools or scripts to gather information from a target system.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code, such as macros in Office documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)**: This is the initial step where Gamaredon uses a malicious attachment to gain access to a target system.
- **Execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic)**: Once the initial access is gained, the group uses VBA macros to perform actions on the target system, such as lateral movement.
- **Collection (T1119-Automated Collection)**: After gaining access and moving laterally, the group is likely to use automated scripts to scan for and collect sensitive documents.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Gamaredon uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment (Outlook VBA macro) to gain initial access to a target system.
2. **Execution**: Once the macro is executed, it can be used for lateral movement to other systems within the network.
3. **Collection**: After establishing a foothold and moving laterally, the group is likely to use automated scripts to scan for and collect sensitive documents.

Given this sequence, it is highly plausible that after gaining initial access and moving laterally, Gamaredon would deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

### Final Answer: A
