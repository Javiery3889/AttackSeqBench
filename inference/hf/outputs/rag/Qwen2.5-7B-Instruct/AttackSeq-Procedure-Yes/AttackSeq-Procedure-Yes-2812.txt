Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Derusbi malware gathers system information.
2. The gathered data is beamed to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via destination port 443.
3. The question asks if it is likely to employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. This aligns with the question's mention of HTTP beaconing.
- **HTTP Beaconing**: This is a method of communication where the malware uses HTTP to send data to the C2 server. This is consistent with the question's description of using destination port 443 (HTTPS) for communication.
- **Obfuscated Communication**: This is a common technique used to evade detection by making the communication harder to analyze. This is plausible in the context of C2 interactions.
- **HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp**: This is a specific example of how the data might be sent. POST requests are a common method for sending data to a server, and the URL /photos/photo.asp is a plausible endpoint for such requests.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware is using HTTPS (port 443) for communication, which aligns with the use of web protocols.
- The question also mentions obfuscated communication, which is a common technique in malware to avoid detection.
- The specific use of HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp is a plausible method for sending data to the C2 server.

Given the alignment of the question with the related TTPs and the plausibility of the described actions, the most likely sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
