Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase.
2. It then proceeds to Collection phase activities such as creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the Discovery phase:
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system itself, such as system details, hardware, and software.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This TTP is about network configuration, which aligns with gathering information like hostname and public IP.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP is about system details, which aligns with gathering detailed system information.

Both of these TTPs are part of the Discovery phase. The question then asks if the backdoor proceeds to Collection phase activities after these Discovery phase actions.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The Aria-body backdoor, after gathering detailed system information (hostname, public IP, and other system details), is likely to proceed to Collection phase activities such as creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities. This is because the Discovery phase is typically followed by the Collection phase in many cyber attack sequences, where the attacker gathers more detailed information and performs actions to exfiltrate or manipulate data.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will indeed proceed to Collection phase activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
