Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - SparrowDoor is a TTP that collects system information.
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents after collecting system information.
   - The question is about the Collection phase and whether file contents will be read as part of this phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves accessing data from the local system, which could include file contents.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as usernames, computer names, and file attributes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which is part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - SparrowDoor is described as a TTP that collects system information, which aligns with T1082 and T1033.
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow will read file contents, which aligns with T1005.
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that after collecting system information (Discovery phase), the next logical step would be to read file contents (Collection phase).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - SparrowDoor (T1082 and T1033) is part of the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks about the Collection phase.
   - Reading file contents (T1005) is a common Collection technique.
   - It is logical that after discovering system information, the next step would be to read file contents to gather more detailed data.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the context provided, it is highly likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents as part of their Collection tactics.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs supports the answer "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
