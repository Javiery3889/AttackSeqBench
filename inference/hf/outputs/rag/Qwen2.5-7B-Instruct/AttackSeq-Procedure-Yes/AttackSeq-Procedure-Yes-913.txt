Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the FAKEM RAT (Remote Access Tool) disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols (Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger) to evade detection. It then asks if it is likely that the FAKEM RAT will use encrypted network communication with XOR operations for command and control activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves using legitimate protocols to disguise malicious traffic.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves using encryption or encoding to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption for command and control communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This is already being used by the FAKEM RAT to disguise its traffic.
- **Technique T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique is about encrypting files, which is not directly related to the network communication described in the question.
- **Technique T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption, which aligns with the question's description of using encrypted network communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The FAKEM RAT is already using legitimate protocols to disguise its traffic, which is a form of T1001.003.
- The question asks about encrypted network communication, which is a form of T1573.001.
- XOR operations are a form of symmetric encryption, which is a subset of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001).

Given that the FAKEM RAT is already using legitimate protocols to disguise its traffic and the question specifically asks about encrypted network communication, it is highly likely that the FAKEM RAT would use symmetric encryption (including XOR operations) for command and control activities to further evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
