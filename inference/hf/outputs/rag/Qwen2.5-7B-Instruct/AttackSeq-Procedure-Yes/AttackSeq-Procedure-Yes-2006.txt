Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
2. Malicious implant installation: Through employee-enabled macro execution.
3. Communication establishment: With Command-and-Control (C2) servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections, which also fits the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate the answer choices based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the reconnaissance activities and implant installation, the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers.
  - The related TTPs (T1018 and T1049) are part of the reconnaissance phase, which is a precursor to establishing communication with C2 servers.
  - BlackEnergy 3 is known for its ability to establish C2 communication after initial compromise, often through the use of implants installed via various methods, including employee-enabled macros.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malicious implant will not establish communication with C2 servers after the described activities.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 and similar malware, which are designed to establish C2 communication post-compromise.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of activities that include reconnaissance and implant installation.
- The related TTPs (T1018 and T1049) are part of the reconnaissance phase, which is a necessary step before establishing C2 communication.
- BlackEnergy 3 is known to establish C2 communication after initial compromise, often through the use of implants installed via various methods, including employee-enabled macros.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that after the described activities, the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A**
