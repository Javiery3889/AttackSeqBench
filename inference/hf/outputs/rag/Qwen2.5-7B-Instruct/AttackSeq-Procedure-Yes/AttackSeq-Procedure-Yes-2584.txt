Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware first gathers system information (hostname, user details, and active TCP connections). The next step is to determine if the malware communicates with C&C servers using application layer protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
  - **Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols (e.g., DNS, ICMP) for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware communicates with the C&C servers using application layer protocols.
  - The related TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols, which aligns with application layer protocols (HTTP, HTTPS).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware does not communicate with the C&C servers using application layer protocols.
  - The related TTPs mention T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, which aligns with non-application layer protocols.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the malware is likely to communicate with the C&C servers using application layer protocols after gathering system information.
- The related TTPs provide context that includes both application layer (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and non-application layer (T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) techniques for C2 communication.
- Given the question's focus on application layer protocols, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1071.001-Web Protocols.

### Final Answer: A
