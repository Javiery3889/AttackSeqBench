Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The threat actors evade defenses using specific Windows API functions.
2. They then query registry values using 'GetStringValue' and 'GetDWORDValue'.
3. Finally, they establish command and control through HTTP/HTTPS communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1012-Query Registry**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Evasion (T1086)**: The question mentions evasion using 'ZwProtectVirtualMemory' and 'ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64'. These are valid evasion techniques.
- **Discovery (T1012-Query Registry)**: The question asks if the threat actors will query registry values using 'GetStringValue' and 'GetDWORDValue'. This aligns with the T1012 technique, which involves querying the Windows registry to gather information about the environment.
- **Command and Control (T1071.003 - Exfiltration over HTTP/HTTPS)**: The question mentions establishing command and control through HTTP/HTTPS communications, which is a valid C2 technique.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Evasion**: The use of 'ZwProtectVirtualMemory' and 'ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64' is a plausible evasion technique.
2. **Discovery**: Querying registry values using 'GetStringValue' and 'GetDWORDValue' is a common discovery technique to gather information about the target environment.
3. **Command and Control**: Establishing C2 through HTTP/HTTPS is a standard method for maintaining control over a compromised system.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
