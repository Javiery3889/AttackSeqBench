### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary first gathers victim identity information by targeting diplomatic and economic entities.
   - The next step is likely to be gaining initial access using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents.
   - Following initial access, the adversary uses UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad technique that encompasses various forms of phishing.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending malicious documents (e.g., PDFs, Word documents) via email.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending malicious links via email.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions "spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents." This aligns directly with **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**.
   - After gaining initial access, the question mentions using UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware. UPX is a common packer used to obfuscate malware, which is consistent with the technique of using packed backdoors.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs provided, the most plausible sequence is that Dropping Elephant would use spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access, followed by UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best fits this sequence is "Yes."
