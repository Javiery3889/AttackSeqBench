Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Babar has achieved persistence by creating a registry key to execute a DLL at system boot. The question then asks if it is likely that Babar will capture screenshots of desktop applications as part of its collection activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Collection** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target environment. This aligns with the question's context of Babar performing collection activities.
- **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing images of the screen, which directly relates to the question about capturing screenshots of desktop applications.

Given that the question is about Babar's collection activities and the related TTPs include screen capture, it is highly plausible that Babar would use screen capture as part of its collection activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: Babar has achieved persistence by creating a registry key to execute a DLL at system boot. This ensures that the malware remains active even after a system restart.
2. **Collection Tactic**: The question mentions that Babar is performing collection activities. This aligns with the Tactic: Collection.
3. **Screen Capture Technique**: The related TTPs include T1113-Screen Capture, which is a specific technique for capturing images of the screen. This directly relates to the question about capturing screenshots of desktop applications.

Given the alignment of the TTPs with the question, it is highly likely that Babar would use screen capture as part of its collection activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
