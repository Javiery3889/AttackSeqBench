Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. NanHaiShu gathers system information from the infected machine.
2. The malware uploads this information to a C&C server.
3. The malware communicates with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers.
4. The malware uploads encoded system information.
5. The malware switches from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's network configuration, which aligns with the malware gathering system information.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for command and control communications, which aligns with the malware using dynamic DNS providers for communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will use dynamic DNS providers to upload encoded system information and switch to a Chinese IP address.
  - Given the related TTPs, using DNS for command and control (T1071.004) is a plausible technique. Dynamic DNS providers can be used to hide the C&C server's IP address, making it harder to detect and block.
  - Switching from a US-based IP address to a Chinese IP address could be a strategy to evade detection by US-based security measures and blend in with legitimate traffic in China.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use dynamic DNS providers or switch IP addresses.
  - This is less plausible given the related TTPs and the need for the malware to maintain communication with the C&C server while evading detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware gathers system information (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery).
- It then uploads this information to a C&C server.
- To maintain communication and evade detection, it uses dynamic DNS providers (T1071.004-DNS).
- The malware then uploads encoded system information.
- Finally, it switches from a US-based IP address to a Chinese IP address to further evade detection.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
