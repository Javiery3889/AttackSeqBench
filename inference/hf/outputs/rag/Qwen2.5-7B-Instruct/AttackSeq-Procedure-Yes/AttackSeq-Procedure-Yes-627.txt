Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Delivery via a compressed file ('Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta').
2. Execution of the embedded VB Script.
3. Dropping and opening a decoy Microsoft Word file.
4. Creating a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file.
5. Rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the use of a malicious file to deliver malware. This aligns with the question's description of delivering malware via a compressed file and dropping an executable.
- **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for scripting and automation. This aligns with the question's description of executing a VB Script.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves multiple steps that are consistent with the TTPs provided:
  - Delivery via a compressed file (T1204.002-Malicious File).
  - Execution of a VB Script (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
  - Dropping and executing a new file (likely an '.exe' file, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File).
  - Rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename (which is a common technique to evade detection, aligning with T1204.002-Malicious File).

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the malware would create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
