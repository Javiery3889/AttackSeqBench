Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer will:
1. Steal information from SNS applications.
2. Encrypt this data using AES.
3. Communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves the use of non-standard ports for command and control (C2) communications.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of protocols that are not typically used for the application layer, which can be used for C2 communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This TTP directly relates to the use of non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556) for C2 communications, which is part of the question.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This TTP suggests the use of protocols that are not typically used for the application layer, which can be a method to avoid detection. However, it does not directly specify the use of non-standard ports.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions the use of non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) for C2 communications, which aligns directly with the T1571-Non-Standard Port TTP.
- The question does not mention the use of non-standard protocols, so T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is not directly relevant to the specific ports mentioned.

Given the specific mention of non-standard ports in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1571-Non-Standard Port.

### Final Answer: A
