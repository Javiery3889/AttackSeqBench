Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Execution of FlowCloud macro.
2. Renaming files.
3. Executing 'gup.exe' using a version of `certutil.exe` (Temptcm.tmp).

The question then asks if it is likely that:
- 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe'.
- 'EhStorAuthn.exe' will extract and install payload file components for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics involved:
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves making malicious activity appear legitimate to evade detection.
- **Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands.
- **Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring the malware runs every time the system boots or a user logs on.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution of 'gup.exe' using `certutil.exe`**: This is a common technique to execute a payload without directly using a `.exe` file, which can help evade detection.
- **'Gup.exe' executing 'EhStorAuthn.exe'**: This is a plausible next step in the sequence, as it involves another executable that could perform further actions.
- **Persistence**: The final step of extracting and installing payload file components for persistence aligns with the TTPs related to persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution of FlowCloud macro**: This is the initial step, which is a common entry point for malware.
2. **Renaming files and executing 'gup.exe' using `certutil.exe`**: This step is consistent with the technique of using a legitimate-looking command to execute a payload.
3. **'Gup.exe' executing 'EhStorAuthn.exe'**: This step is plausible as it involves another executable that could perform further actions, such as persistence.
4. **Persistence**: The final step of extracting and installing payload file components for persistence is a common tactic to ensure the malware remains active.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
