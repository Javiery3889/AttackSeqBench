### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT41 has already moved laterally within targeted networks and accessed game production environments.
   - The objective is to determine if APT41 is likely to collect source code and digital certificates from these environments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.003-Code Signing Certificates:** This technique involves the use of code signing certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique involves using code signing to evade detection by security systems.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials, which can be used for further access and privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT41's objective is to attain valuable assets, which in this context could include source code and digital certificates.
     - The related TTPs suggest that APT41 is likely to use code signing certificates and code signing techniques to enhance their operations and evade detection.
     - Collecting source code and digital certificates aligns with the tactics of resource development and defense evasion, as these assets can be used to create and sign malicious code or to further evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the described scenario and the related TTPs. If APT41 is moving laterally and accessing game production environments, it is highly likely that they would collect valuable assets such as source code and digital certificates.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: Yes
