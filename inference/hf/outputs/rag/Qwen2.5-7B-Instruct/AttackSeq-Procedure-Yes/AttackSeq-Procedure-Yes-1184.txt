Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: social engineering to enable macros and payload execution, followed by adding the path to the VBS script to the task scheduler for persistence, and then collecting system information and communicating with a C&C server using a PowerShell script.
   - The key points are:
     - Social engineering to enable macros and payload execution.
     - Adding the VBS script to the task scheduler for persistence.
     - Collecting system information and communicating with a C&C server using a PowerShell script.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" and "Scheduled Task" (T1053.005).
   - T1053.005-Scheduled Task is a technique where an attacker uses the Windows Task Scheduler to run a script or program at a specified time or interval, which is a method of achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will add the path to the VBS script to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - Given the related TTPs, adding a script to the task scheduler is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - The sequence described in the question (social engineering, adding to task scheduler, collecting information, and communicating with C&C) is a plausible and common attack sequence.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Social engineering is used to trick victims into enabling macros and executing a payload.
   - After the payload is executed, the attackers likely want to maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - Adding the VBS script to the task scheduler is a method to achieve persistence, which aligns with the TTPs provided.
   - The sequence then proceeds to collect system information and communicate with a C&C server, which is a typical follow-up action after achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
