Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, after discovering relevant systems, users, and data, attackers are likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the relevant data. This implies that the attackers are in the process of reconnaissance and data collection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**: This technique involves attackers using kernel modules or extensions to gain elevated privileges. This is a method to maintain or escalate access to systems.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves attackers collecting data from the local system where they have already gained access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after discovering relevant systems, users, and data, attackers will likely install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the data.
  - **Privilege Escalation (T1547.006)**: This TTP is about gaining higher privileges, which can be used to maintain access and control over the systems. This is a common practice to ensure that the attackers can continue to access the systems even if their initial access is compromised.
  - **Collection (T1005)**: This TTP is about collecting data from the local system. If the attackers have already installed persistence mechanisms, they can more easily and reliably collect the data they need.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that after discovering relevant systems, users, and data, attackers will not likely install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the data.
  - This is less likely because maintaining persistence is a crucial step in ensuring that the attackers can continue to access the systems and collect data over time, especially if the initial access is detected and removed.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers are likely to use privilege escalation techniques to maintain access and control over the systems.
- Once they have gained higher privileges, they can install persistence mechanisms to ensure they can continue to access the systems even if their initial access is compromised.
- With persistence in place, they can then proceed to collect the relevant data from the local system.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to first gain higher privileges and then install persistence mechanisms before collecting the data.

**Final Answer: A**
