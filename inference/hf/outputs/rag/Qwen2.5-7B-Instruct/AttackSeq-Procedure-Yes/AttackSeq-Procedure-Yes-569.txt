Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by malware:
1. Collects basic system information.
2. Searches for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
3. Saves screen recording files in a specific format during the data collection phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Collection**
  - **Technique: T1125-Video Capture**: This technique involves capturing video content from a system.
  - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots or screen recordings from a system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1125-Video Capture**: This technique is specifically about capturing video content, which aligns with the question's mention of saving screen recording files.
- **Technique T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique is about capturing screenshots or screen recordings, which also aligns with the question's mention of saving screen recording files.

Given that the question specifically mentions "screen recording files," we need to determine if this aligns with the techniques provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the malware is likely to save screen recording files during the data collection phase.
- The related TTPs include both video capture and screen capture techniques, which are relevant to the question.
- The format mentioned in the question, `[%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi`, is a common format for video files, which aligns with the video capture technique (T1125).

Given that the question specifically mentions "screen recording files" and the related TTPs include video capture, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware is indeed likely to save screen recording files.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
