### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Gamaredon, a known threat actor. The sequence starts with the use of backdoors to list interesting files, such as Office documents. The question then asks if Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares mounted as drives, for sensitive data before uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery (Tactic: Discovery):** This technique is used to identify files and directories, which aligns with the initial step of listing interesting files.
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media (Tactic: Collection):** This technique is relevant to scanning removable drives for data.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive (Tactic: Collection):** This technique is relevant to scanning network shares for data.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that Gamaredon would scan all relevant drives and network shares for sensitive data, which aligns with the techniques T1025 and T1039.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that Gamaredon would not scan all relevant drives and network shares for sensitive data, which does not align with the techniques T1025 and T1039.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the techniques involved in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares mounted as drives, for sensitive data.

**Final Answer: A**
