Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the malware ZoxPNG:
1. It begins communication with the victim's machine via the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion.
2. It is then asked if it is likely to establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This is the overarching tactic that encompasses the malware's communication with the C2 server.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the techniques mentioned. Using web protocols (HTTP GET request) for C2 communication is a common method, especially when the malware is exploiting proxy settings for evasion.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that ZoxPNG does not use HTTP GET requests for C2 communication, which contradicts the techniques mentioned and the common practices of malware that use proxy settings for evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes ZoxPNG using the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for evasion, which is a common method to bypass security measures.
- The related TTPs mention the use of web protocols (HTTP GET) for C2 communication and the use of proxies for C2 communication.
- Given that ZoxPNG is already using proxy settings for evasion, it is highly likely that it would also use an HTTP GET request to establish contact with the C2 server, as this is a standard and effective method for C2 communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
