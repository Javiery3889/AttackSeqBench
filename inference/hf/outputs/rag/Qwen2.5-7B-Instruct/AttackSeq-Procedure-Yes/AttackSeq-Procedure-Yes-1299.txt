### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 in an Excel document, leading to silent code execution.
   - It then asks if the attack is likely to hide artifacts using T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on a client system. This aligns with the initial part of the attack sequence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection. This directly relates to the question about hiding artifacts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The attack sequence starts with exploiting a vulnerability to execute code. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
   - After execution, the question asks if the attack will hide artifacts. The related TTPs specifically mention hiding files and directories, which aligns with T1158.
   - The question then asks if the attack will proceed to search for and extract credentials from the registry or stored files. This is a common follow-up step in many post-exploitation scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after executing the code, the attackers would hide the artifacts (e.g., hidden files or directories) to evade detection before proceeding to extract credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Yes, the attack will likely hide artifacts before searching for and extracting credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
