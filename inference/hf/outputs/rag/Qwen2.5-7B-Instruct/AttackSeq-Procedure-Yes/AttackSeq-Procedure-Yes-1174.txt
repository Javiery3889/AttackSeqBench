Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: using publicly available exploits for initial access, then obtaining legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access, and finally deploying custom malware for Command and Control operations.
   - The question asks if the group is likely to obtain legitimate credentials after initial access and before deploying custom malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is about using publicly available exploits to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access to the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions "obtaining legitimate credentials to compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access." This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique, which is part of the Persistence tactic.
   - The sequence described in the question (initial access -> obtaining credentials -> deploying custom malware) is a common and plausible sequence in many cyber-attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The group uses publicly available exploits to gain initial access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
   - To maintain access and avoid detection, the group is likely to obtain legitimate credentials (T1078-Valid Accounts), which is a common tactic in maintaining persistence.
   - After establishing persistence, the group would then deploy custom malware (like WellMess or WellMail) for Command and Control operations.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the answer that the group is likely to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access before deploying custom malware.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
