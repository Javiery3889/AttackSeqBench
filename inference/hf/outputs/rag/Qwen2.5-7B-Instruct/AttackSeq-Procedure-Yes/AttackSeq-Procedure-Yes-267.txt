Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk (defense evasion).
2. Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process (process injection).
3. Connecting the RAT back to its control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com (command and control).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This is not directly relevant to the question as it pertains to privilege escalation, not the sequence of actions described.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This is relevant as it involves using DNS for command and control, which aligns with connecting to a control server.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This is also relevant as it involves process injection, which is part of the sequence described.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory and injecting it into a new process, connecting to a control server via DNS is a logical next step for command and control.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. There is no reason to believe that the attackers would skip the step of connecting to the control server after the other actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory, injecting it into a new process, and then connecting to the control server.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1071.004-DNS, support the idea of using DNS for command and control.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that the attackers would connect the RAT back to its control server.

**Final Answer: A**
