Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Scanning for deleted files.
2. Monitoring network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers.
3. Crawling through the file system to gather computer information.
4. Encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the crawling through the file system to gather computer information.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automated collection of data, which could be relevant to the scanning for deleted files and monitoring network traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of activities. The TTPs T1005 and T1119 support the scanning and monitoring activities, and the crawling through the file system to gather information fits the collection tactic.
  - The encoding and embedding of payload information within cookie data for exfiltration is a plausible exfiltration technique, which is consistent with the Regin malware's known behavior.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of activities. If Regin is not likely to perform these actions, it would contradict the known behavior of the malware and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of activities that are consistent with the TTPs related to the Regin malware.
- The TTPs T1005 and T1119 support the scanning and monitoring activities, and the crawling through the file system to gather information fits the collection tactic.
- The encoding and embedding of payload information within cookie data for exfiltration is a known exfiltration technique for Regin.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
