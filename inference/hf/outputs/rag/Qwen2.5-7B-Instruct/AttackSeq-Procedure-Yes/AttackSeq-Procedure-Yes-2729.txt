Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Credential access using the Responder tool.
2. Discovery activities (specifically system service discovery).
3. Lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC.
4. Establishing network connections.
5. Copying malware to remote hosts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering services running on a system, which is a common step in reconnaissance.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows administrative shares for lateral movement.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC)**: This technique involves using WMIC for execution, which can be part of the lateral movement process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After gaining credentials, the group would likely conduct discovery activities to understand the target environment. This is followed by lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC, and finally, copying malware to remote hosts.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the group does not conduct discovery activities, it would be less likely to understand the target environment and perform effective lateral movement and malware deployment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the group first gains credentials, then conducts discovery, and subsequently performs lateral movement and malware deployment.
- The related TTPs support this sequence, with T1007 for discovery, T1021.002 for lateral movement, and T1047 for execution.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer: Yes
