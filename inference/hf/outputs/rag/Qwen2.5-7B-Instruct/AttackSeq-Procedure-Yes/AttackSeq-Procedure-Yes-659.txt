Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spear-phishing emails are used to deliver malicious Office documents.
2. These documents exploit the DDE protocol for commands in memory.
3. PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads are executed for defense evasion.

The question then asks if Gallmaker (a hypothetical adversary) is likely to use living off the land (LotL) tactics and remove tools from the victim's machines after executing these payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves using DDE to execute code in memory, which aligns with the question's mention of exploiting DDE.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious attachments, which aligns with the question's mention of delivering malicious Office documents via spear-phishing emails.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Gallmaker would use LotL tactics and remove tools from the victim's machines after executing the PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads.
  - LotL tactics involve using legitimate tools and processes to hide malicious activities, which can help in evading detection.
  - Removing tools from the victim's machines can help in reducing the footprint and making it harder for defenders to detect the presence of the adversary.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Gallmaker would not use LotL tactics and would not remove tools from the victim's machines after executing the PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads.
  - This would mean that the adversary would leave their tools in place, which could make it easier for defenders to detect and remove them.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sophisticated attack sequence involving spear-phishing, DDE exploitation, and PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads for defense evasion.
- Gallmaker, as a sophisticated adversary, is likely to employ LotL tactics to blend in with normal system activities and remove tools to avoid detection.
- The use of LotL and tool removal are common practices in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Final Answer: Final Answer: A
