Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where mobile applications loaded with spyware are used to collect sensitive information from victims. This activity falls under the Collection phase. The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This TTP directly relates to the use of application layer protocols for Command and Control.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This TTP is about automated exfiltration of data, which is relevant to the transfer of stolen data.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This TTP involves the use of non-application layer protocols for Command and Control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of application layer protocols for Command and Control, as indicated by T1071.
  - It also aligns with the transfer of stolen data, which is a common activity during the Exfiltration phase.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the stolen data is not transferred over application layer protocols, which contradicts the information provided in the question and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of spyware to collect sensitive information, which is part of the Collection phase.
- The stolen data is likely to be exfiltrated, which is a common activity in the Exfiltration phase.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of application layer protocols for Command and Control (T1071) and the transfer of data (T1020).
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

### Final Answer: Yes
