Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. ChChes (a malware) establishes communication with C&C servers using HTTP cookie headers for defense evasion.
2. The malware is likely to communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules.
3. The communication is expected to be through encrypted methods to expand its capabilities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves impersonating a legitimate protocol or service to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Establishing communication using HTTP cookie headers (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a plausible method for C2 communication.
  - Receiving commands and modules to expand capabilities is a common behavior of malware.
  - Using encrypted communication methods (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but implied by the question) is a common practice to evade detection and ensure secure communication.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described behavior of malware. If the malware is established and communicating using HTTP cookie headers, it is likely to continue this behavior to receive commands and modules.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware is already using HTTP cookie headers for C2 communication, which is a common technique (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
- The malware is likely to continue this behavior to receive commands and modules, which is a standard operation for expanding its capabilities.
- The use of encrypted communication methods is a common practice to ensure secure and undetected communication, which aligns with the question's description.

### Final Answer: Yes
