Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) for initial access.
2. Using the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading.
3. Evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading and then deployed a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable to evade defenses.
  - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs:
    - T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: The initial exploitation of the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) is a form of client-side exploitation.
    - T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading: The use of Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading and deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable is a form of defense evasion.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers did not use the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading or deploy a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable to evade defenses.
  - This does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of DLL sideloading and defense evasion techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve exploiting a vulnerability, using a dropper for DLL sideloading, and then deploying a malicious DLL to evade defenses.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of DLL sideloading (T1574.002) and defense evasion (T1574.002) techniques.
- Answer Choice A aligns perfectly with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: Yes**
