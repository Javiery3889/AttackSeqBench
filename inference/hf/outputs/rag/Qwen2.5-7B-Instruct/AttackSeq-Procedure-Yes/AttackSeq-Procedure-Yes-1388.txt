Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. **Execution Phase**: Collecting system and account information, as well as crypto wallet data.
2. **Command and Control (C2) Phase**: Making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers.
3. **Command and Control (C2) Phase**: Using Telegram features to communicate with these C&C servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for C2 communication, which aligns with the question's mention of a Telegram channel.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the C2 channel for exfiltration, which is not directly relevant to the question but provides context.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves bidirectional communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is relevant to the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's description of Raccoon stealer making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers and then using Telegram features to communicate with these C&C servers.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, support this sequence of actions.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the question's description and the related TTPs, as it would imply that Raccoon stealer does not use a Telegram channel for receiving C&C addresses and communicating with C&C servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Raccoon stealer collects data and then uses a Telegram channel to receive C&C addresses and communicate with C&C servers.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, support this sequence.
- Answer Choice A aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
