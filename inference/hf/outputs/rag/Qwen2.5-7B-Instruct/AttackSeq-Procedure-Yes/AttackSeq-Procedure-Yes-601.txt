Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already established contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the question's scenario of "automatically exfiltrating AWS credentials."
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which also aligns with the scenario of exfiltrating data over the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Both T1020 and T1041 are relevant to the question, but T1020 specifically mentions automated exfiltration, which directly addresses the "automatically" part of the question.
   - T1041 mentions exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the C2 server mentioned in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of exfiltrating AWS credentials automatically over the C2 server.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration directly supports the "automatically" part of the question.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel supports the exfiltration over the C2 server part of the question.
   - Given that both techniques are relevant, but T1020 more directly addresses the "automatically" aspect, it is more likely that the attackers would use a technique that explicitly mentions automation.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the one that includes automated exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the answer is: Final Answer: A
