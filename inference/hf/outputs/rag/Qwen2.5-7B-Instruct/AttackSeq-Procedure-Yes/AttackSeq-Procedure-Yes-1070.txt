Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have already implemented checks to evade detection by security software. The next steps in the attack sequence are:
1. Collecting system information.
2. Capturing screenshots.
3. Exfiltrating the collected information to a Mattermost server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**

These TTPs directly relate to the actions of collecting system information and capturing screenshots, which are mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions: collecting system information (T1005) and capturing screenshots (T1113) before exfiltrating the data.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the attackers do not perform these actions, which contradicts the scenario described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where attackers are likely to perform specific actions after evading security software.
- The related TTPs (T1005 and T1113) directly correspond to the actions of collecting system information and capturing screenshots, which are part of the described sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes these actions.

**Final Answer: Yes**
