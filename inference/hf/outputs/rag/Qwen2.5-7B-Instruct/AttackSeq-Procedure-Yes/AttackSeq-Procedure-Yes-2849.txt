Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions during the execution phase:
1. PowerShell scripts download a Windows executable.
2. PowerShell scripts download a decoy document.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution. It aligns with the first part of the question where PowerShell scripts are used to download files.
- The question asks about the likelihood of retrieving an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase. However, the related TTPs do not directly address the command and control phase or the retrieval of an image file containing encoded malware.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Execution Phase**: The question mentions that PowerShell scripts are used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document. This aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique.
2. **Command and Control Phase**: The question asks about the likelihood of retrieving an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase. The related TTPs do not provide information about the command and control phase or the retrieval of such a file.
3. **Plausibility**: While the use of PowerShell for downloading files is plausible, the question specifically asks about the command and control phase and the retrieval of an image file containing encoded malware. The provided TTPs do not support this specific scenario.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the provided TTPs do not support the retrieval of an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
