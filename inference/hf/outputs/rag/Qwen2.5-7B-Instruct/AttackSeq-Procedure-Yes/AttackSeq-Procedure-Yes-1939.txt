Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file.
2. Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `config.json` file.
3. Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery** is a technique that involves gathering information about the target's system, including its configuration, network, and software. This aligns with the first step of collecting the OS version from `SystemVersion.plist`.

- The question then asks if Smooth Operator is likely to parse and extract domain and account name values from the `config.json` file. This step involves extracting specific information from a configuration file, which is a form of data gathering and could be part of the discovery process.

- Finally, the question asks if Smooth Operator performs HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers. This is a common TTP in the post-attack phase, but it is not directly related to the discovery phase described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first step (collecting the OS version) is clearly part of the discovery process.
- The second step (parsing and extracting domain and account name values) is also a form of data gathering, which is consistent with the discovery tactic.
- The third step (HTTPS-based communication) is not part of the discovery phase but rather a communication phase.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Smooth Operator would indeed perform the first two steps as part of the discovery process.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
