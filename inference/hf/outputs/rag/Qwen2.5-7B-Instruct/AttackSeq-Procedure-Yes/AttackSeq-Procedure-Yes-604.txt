Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access. It then asks whether it is likely that adversaries will use tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance to detect compromised Docker APIs before deploying malicious containers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves attackers using external remote services to gain access to a network. This aligns with the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying malicious containers, which is a step that occurs after initial access.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007-Container API**: This technique involves accessing container APIs, which is relevant to the question as it pertains to compromised Docker APIs.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that adversaries will use tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance to detect compromised Docker APIs.
  - DOCKERGEDDON is a tool designed to scan for misconfigured Docker APIs, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase (T1046) of the attack lifecycle.
  - Given that the question mentions initial access via misconfigured Docker APIs, it is reasonable to assume that adversaries would use such tools to confirm the presence of these misconfigurations before proceeding with further actions.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that adversaries will not use tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance to detect compromised Docker APIs.
  - This would imply that adversaries would not take the step to confirm the presence of misconfigured Docker APIs, which seems less likely given the potential value of such information in planning further attacks.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where attackers have exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access.
- The related TTPs indicate that adversaries would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to scan for misconfigured Docker APIs during reconnaissance.
- Given the value of confirming the presence of misconfigured Docker APIs, it is highly plausible that adversaries would use such tools to gather intelligence before deploying malicious containers.

**Final Answer: A**
