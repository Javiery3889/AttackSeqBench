Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques are used in the Defense Evasion phase.
2. The loader then gathers information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase.
3. The loader collects detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
- **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques (Defense Evasion phase)**: These techniques are used to evade detection by security tools and analysts. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
- **Gathering information about the victim's computer (Discovery phase)**: This aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique, which is a standard step in the Discovery phase to understand the environment.
- **Collecting detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor**: This is a typical action in the later stages of an attack, often after the attacker has established a foothold and gathered initial information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques**: These are used to evade detection, which is a common initial step.
2. **Gathering information about the victim's computer**: This is a logical next step in the Discovery phase, where the attacker would want to understand the environment.
3. **Collecting detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor**: This is a natural progression after gathering initial information, as the attacker would want to maintain access and gather more detailed data.

Given the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the loader would indeed gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase before collecting detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor.

### Final Answer: A
