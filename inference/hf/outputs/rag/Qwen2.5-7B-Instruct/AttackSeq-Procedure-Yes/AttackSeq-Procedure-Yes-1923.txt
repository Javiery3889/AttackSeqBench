Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The use of `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases for credentials.
2. The spyware leveraging C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities.
3. The use of IP addresses related to the initial execution flow and additional payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
  - This technique involves accessing credentials stored in web browsers, which aligns with the use of `libchrome.exe` to query Chrome's SQLite databases.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the browser, which could include the SQLite databases used by Chrome. This is relevant to the initial step of querying the databases.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial credential access, the spyware would use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities, and leverage IP addresses related to the initial execution flow and additional payloads.
  - The related TTPs support the initial credential access and browser information discovery, which are prerequisites for the Command and Control activities.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the spyware would not use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the spyware first accesses credentials from Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.
- The related TTPs confirm that this is a valid technique for credential access and browser information discovery.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the spyware would use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities, which is a logical next step after gaining access to credentials.
- The use of IP addresses related to the initial execution flow and additional payloads is a common practice in malware operations to maintain persistence and evade detection.

Given the logical sequence and the support from the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the spyware would indeed use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities.

**Final Answer: A**
