Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a backdoor program has successfully evaded detection and is now gathering host information. The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with the C2 server. The question specifically asks if it is likely that this communication will be via DNS tunneling to receive commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
- **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**

DNS tunneling is a technique where data is exfiltrated or commands are received by encoding the data within DNS queries and responses. This technique is often used in C2 communications because DNS is a widely trusted and commonly used protocol, making it harder to detect malicious activity.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of DNS tunneling as a method for C2 communication. Given that DNS tunneling is a well-known and effective technique for establishing covert communication channels, it is plausible that a backdoor program would use this method to communicate with the C2 server.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that DNS tunneling would not be used for C2 communication. However, without additional context or information suggesting that DNS tunneling is not a viable or preferred method, this choice seems less plausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where a backdoor program has successfully evaded detection and is now establishing communication with the C2 server.
- DNS tunneling is a common and effective method for C2 communication because it leverages the trusted nature of DNS.
- The related TTPs specifically mention DNS tunneling as a technique for C2, which supports the use of this method in the scenario described.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor program will indeed establish communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling to receive commands.

**Final Answer: A**
