Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initial infiltration
2. Collection of initial system information (browser history and cached credentials)
3. Checking Internet connectivity
4. Obtaining the external IP address of the targeted system

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves determining whether the target system has an active internet connection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the 'Recon' module group would first collect system information and then check for internet connectivity.
  - The related TTPs (T1016 and T1016.001) support this sequence, as they both fall under the Discovery tactic and logically follow the order of collecting system information before checking network connectivity.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the 'Recon' module group would first check for internet connectivity and then collect system information.
  - This sequence does not align as well with the typical order of operations in a cyber attack. Typically, attackers would first gather as much information as possible about the target system before determining if it has internet access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'Recon' module group is likely to start by gathering as much information as possible about the target system, which includes browser history and cached credentials (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery).
- After collecting this information, the next logical step would be to check if the system has internet connectivity (T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery).
- This sequence makes more sense from a logical and operational standpoint in a cyber attack.

### Final Answer: Yes
