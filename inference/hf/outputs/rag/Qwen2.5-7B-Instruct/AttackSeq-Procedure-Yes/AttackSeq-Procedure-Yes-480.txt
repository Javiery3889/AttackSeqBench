Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Trickbot malware:
1. Connecting to its Command and Control (C2) server.
2. Downloading and executing its payload.
3. Deleting files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
- **Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves the deletion of files, which aligns with the third step in the sequence described in the question.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used by an adversary to avoid being detected or investigated. While this is a broader category, it does not directly relate to the specific action of deleting files.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Connecting to C2 Server and Executing Payload**: This is a common initial step for many malware families, including Trickbot.
2. **Deleting Files**: The question specifically asks if Trickbot is likely to proceed to delete files with specific extensions. The related TTPs do not directly address this action, but the technique T1070.004-File Deletion is relevant.
3. **Context of Trickbot**: Trickbot is known for its ability to perform various actions, including deleting files, as part of its payload execution and to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, Trickbot is indeed likely to proceed to delete files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives as part of its impact tactics. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the provided technique.

Final Answer: A
