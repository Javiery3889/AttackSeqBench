Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Charming Kitten during the Resource Development phase, where they created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves creating fake social media accounts to gather information or spread misinformation.
   - **T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves creating fake email accounts to gather information or spread misinformation.
   - **T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating individuals or entities to gain trust or access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that Charming Kitten used social media and email accounts to gather information, which aligns with the Reconnaissance phase.
   - Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists is a form of impersonation, which is directly related to T1656.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they targeted non-Iranian researchers, which implies a broader scope of potential targets beyond just Iranian researchers.

Given the context of the related TTPs and the nature of the question, it is plausible that Charming Kitten would use impersonation techniques to target non-Iranian researchers as part of their Reconnaissance phase activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
