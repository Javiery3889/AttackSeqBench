Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers use images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. The next steps in the attack sequence are:
1. Verify victims' credentials in real-time.
2. Prompt for the 2-step verification code.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to gain access to accounts.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which aligns with the initial use of images in phishing emails.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing links, which could be part of the initial attack vector.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique is directly related to the initial use of images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.
- **Technique T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique aligns with the next step of verifying credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The attackers use images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. This is a form of T1598-Phishing for Information.
2. **Credential Verification**: After the initial phishing attempt, the attackers likely need to verify the victims' credentials in real-time. This step is necessary to proceed with the attack and aligns with T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception.
3. **Prompt for 2-Step Verification Code**: Once the credentials are verified, the attackers would prompt the victims for the 2-step verification code to bypass MFA.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the context provided by the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Phishing for Information (T1598)
- Multi-Factor Authentication Interception (T1111)

### Final Answer: A: Yes
