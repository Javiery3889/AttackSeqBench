Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideWinder APT group:
1. Exploitation via CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
2. Use of exploits from the C&C server, such as CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation.
3. Employing techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique aligns with the initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique aligns with the use of exploits to root devices for privilege escalation.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It includes the initial access via malicious apps (T1190) and the subsequent privilege escalation (T1068) using exploits.
  - The question also mentions the use of obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection, which are common techniques used by APT groups to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the group did not use the exploits for privilege escalation or did not employ techniques to evade detection, which contradicts the information provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include initial access via malicious apps and subsequent privilege escalation using exploits.
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions are common in APT operations.
- The use of obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection is a standard practice for APT groups.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
