Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
1. Defense evasion (deleting files and disabling security tools).
2. Gathering information about the victim's computer and environment.
3. Scanning for files matching specific extensions on local and network drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the types of actions the Sednit group might take:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows registry to gather information about the system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data from the system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The Sednit group is known for performing extensive reconnaissance and data collection. The related TTPs indicate that they use techniques like querying the registry (T1012), automated collection (T1119), and file and directory discovery (T1083). These techniques align with the described actions of gathering information about the victim's computer and environment, and scanning for specific files.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the Sednit group does not perform these actions, which contradicts the known behavior of the group based on the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Sednit group is known for its sophisticated and thorough approach to reconnaissance and data collection.
- The related TTPs (T1012, T1119, and T1083) directly support the actions described in the question.
- The sequence of actions (defense evasion followed by information gathering and file scanning) is consistent with the known tactics and techniques of the Sednit group.

### Final Answer: Yes
