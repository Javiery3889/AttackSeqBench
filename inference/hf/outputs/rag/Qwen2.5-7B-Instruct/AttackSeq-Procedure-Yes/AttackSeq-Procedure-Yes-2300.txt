Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Accessing the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying.
2. Installing the Cobalt Strike beacon using a PowerShell one-liner.
3. Leveraging scheduled tasks to execute a batch file for their tasks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the question's mention of using a PowerShell one-liner to install the Cobalt Strike beacon.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves the use of scheduled tasks to execute commands or scripts, which aligns with the question's mention of leveraging scheduled tasks to execute a batch file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the adversary followed the sequence described in the question.
  - Password spraying (T1555) is a technique used to obtain credentials, which aligns with the first step in the sequence.
  - Using PowerShell (T1059.001) to install the Cobalt Strike beacon aligns with the second step.
  - Leveraging scheduled tasks (T1053.005) to execute a batch file aligns with the third step.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is not likely.
  - If the sequence is not likely, it would mean that one or more of the steps do not align with the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs provide a clear alignment with the steps described in the question.
- Password spraying (T1555) is a common initial access technique.
- Using PowerShell (T1059.001) to install the Cobalt Strike beacon is a known method.
- Leveraging scheduled tasks (T1053.005) to execute a batch file is a common persistence technique.

Given the alignment of the related TTPs with the steps in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

### Final Answer: Yes
