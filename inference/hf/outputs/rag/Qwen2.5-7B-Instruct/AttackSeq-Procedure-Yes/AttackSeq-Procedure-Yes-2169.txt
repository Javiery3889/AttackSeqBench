### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
   - It also mentions a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad category that includes both spear phishing links and attachments.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using links in emails to deliver malware or gain access.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using attachments in emails to deliver malware or gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions OLE2 format documents containing embedded links, which aligns with **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**.
   - The technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it can be inferred as part of the reconnaissance phase, which is covered by the broader **T1566-Phishing** category.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question (spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links) is a plausible initial access technique.
   - The GET request technique, while not explicitly listed, can be considered part of the broader reconnaissance phase of the attack.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: A
