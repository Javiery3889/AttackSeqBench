Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the XAgent app:
1. Executing itself in the background on iOS 7 devices while hiding its icon.
2. Restarting when terminated.
3. Collecting geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.
4. Sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves the exfiltration of data over a command and control (C&C) channel.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which can include collecting geo-location data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The question describes the app collecting geo-location data as part of its discovery routine, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
  - The collected data is then sent to the C&C server via HTTP, which aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.
  - Both of these actions are consistent with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the app does not collect geo-location data or does not send the collected data to the C&C server, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include collecting geo-location data and sending it to a C&C server.
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions are part of the T1082-System Information Discovery and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel techniques.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is consistent with the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
