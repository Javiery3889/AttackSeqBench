Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware gathers victim system information.
2. The malware uses HTTPS for C2 communication.
3. The malware uses Microsoft OneDrive and potentially Dropbox for bidirectional communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication. HTTPS is a web protocol, so this TTP aligns with the use of HTTPS for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves using cloud storage services for bidirectional communication. Both Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox are cloud storage services, so this TTP aligns with the use of these services for bidirectional communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of HTTPS for C2 communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
  - This choice also aligns with the use of Microsoft OneDrive and potentially Dropbox for bidirectional communication (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the use of HTTPS for C2 communication or the use of cloud storage services for bidirectional communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are consistent with the related TTPs.
- The use of HTTPS for C2 communication is directly supported by the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.
- The use of Microsoft OneDrive and potentially Dropbox for bidirectional communication is directly supported by the T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication technique.
- Both answer choices A and B are plausible, but choice A is more comprehensive and aligns with the provided TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
