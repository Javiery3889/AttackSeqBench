Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities during the Collection phase, specifically mentioning the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It then asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data to an external location.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not part of the command and control (C2) infrastructure.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of automated exfiltration (T1020) and the exfiltration over unencrypted protocols (T1048.003). The question mentions FTP, which is an unencrypted protocol, and the use of stored login credentials for automatic exfiltration fits the description of T1020.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that CosmicDuke does not use automated exfiltration or does not exfiltrate data over unencrypted protocols, which does not align with the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of activities that involve collecting data using various tools (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer) during the Collection phase.
- The related TTPs indicate that automated exfiltration (T1020) and exfiltration over unencrypted protocols (T1048.003) are relevant techniques.
- CosmicDuke is likely to use these techniques to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials, which fits the description of T1020 and T1048.003.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
