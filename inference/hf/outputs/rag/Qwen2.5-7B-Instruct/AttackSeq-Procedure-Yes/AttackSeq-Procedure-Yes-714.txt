Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an initial access method where a Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word through a malicious macro. It then asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file. While this is relevant, it doesn't directly address the sequence of TTPs after the initial access.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code. This is relevant because the question mentions a malicious macro, which is often written in VBA.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - If the Rising Sun implant is downloaded and acts as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities, this would align with the tactic of execution and the use of VBA to execute malicious code. The Rising Sun implant could be designed to download additional payloads, which is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - If the Rising Sun implant does not download a second-stage payload, this would imply that the implant's purpose is limited to the initial stage of the attack. However, the question suggests that the implant is likely to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities, which contradicts this answer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is achieved through a malicious macro, which aligns with the use of VBA (T1059.005).
- The Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word, which is a common technique for initial access.
- The Rising Sun implant is likely to download a second-stage payload to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities, which is a common tactic in APTs.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A**
