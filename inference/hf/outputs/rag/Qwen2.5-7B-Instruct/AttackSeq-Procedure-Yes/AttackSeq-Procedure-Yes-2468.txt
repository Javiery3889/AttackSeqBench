Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. A PDF attachment is sent.
2. The attachment passes through security filters and appears benign.
3. The attack evades detection by using legitimate tools and scripts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)**: This technique involves using a malicious attachment, such as a PDF, to gain initial access to a system. This aligns with the first part of the question where a PDF attachment is sent.
- **Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading)**: This technique involves making the malicious activity appear benign or normal to evade detection. This aligns with the second part of the question where the attack evades detection by using legitimate tools and scripts.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a PDF attachment, which is a common method for initial access. This is consistent with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
2. **Defense Evasion**: After gaining initial access, the attack uses legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection. This is consistent with T1036-Masquerading.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
