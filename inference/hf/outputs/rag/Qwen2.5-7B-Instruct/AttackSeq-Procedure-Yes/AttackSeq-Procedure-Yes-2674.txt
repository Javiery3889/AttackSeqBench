### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious payload (ZoxPNG) is executed via commands received from a C2 server.
   - The question asks if the C2 server is likely to respond with a PNG file containing the next instruction for continued Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within a file, such as a PNG image. This aligns with the question's mention of a PNG file containing instructions.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS queries for C2 communication. While relevant, it does not directly relate to the use of a PNG file.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is compromised. It does not directly relate to the use of a PNG file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the use of steganography (T1001.002) to hide instructions within a PNG file, which is a plausible method for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the use of steganography to hide instructions within a PNG file, which is a plausible method for C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
