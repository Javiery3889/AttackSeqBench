Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A backdoor is installed.
2. The backdoor exfiltrates data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will then shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system to disrupt operations.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This technique directly aligns with the question's scenario of shutting down the victim's computer to disrupt operations.
- **Technique T1070.004-File Deletion**: While this technique is related to defense evasion, it does not directly address the question of shutting down the system to impact availability.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.
- The related TTPs include a technique (T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot) that directly addresses the act of shutting down the system.
- The other related TTP (T1070.004-File Deletion) is more about evading detection rather than disrupting system availability through shutdown.

Given the context and the specific TTPs provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the technique of shutting down the system to disrupt operations.

### Final Answer: A
