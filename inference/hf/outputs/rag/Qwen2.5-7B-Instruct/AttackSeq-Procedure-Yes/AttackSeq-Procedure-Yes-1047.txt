Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Emissary Panda exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.
2. They performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit.
3. They used the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
- **Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exploitation of Microsoft SharePoint**: This is a valid initial compromise and persistence mechanism.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question asks if lateral movement was performed using stolen credentials and EternalBlue. This is a plausible step in an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign.
- **HyperBro Backdoor**: This is a communication tool used to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Compromise**: Emissary Panda exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells. This is a common initial compromise method.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The question suggests that after the initial compromise, they performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and EternalBlue. EternalBlue is a known exploit that can be used for lateral movement, especially in environments with outdated or misconfigured systems.
3. **Communication**: After gaining access to other systems, they used the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
