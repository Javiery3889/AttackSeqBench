Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where recipients are sent spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 for the delivery of QuasarRAT. The question then asks if it is likely that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system. In this case, it is the exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link to the victim, which is consistent with the scenario of sending spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment, which is also consistent with the scenario of sending spear phishing emails with RTF documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the infection occurs. This aligns with the technique of T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, where the link might lead to a document that appears legitimate but is actually malicious.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the recipients will not be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the infection occurs. This does not align with the typical behavior of sophisticated spear phishing attacks, which often use social engineering to make the document appear legitimate to the victim.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where recipients are sent spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents. This aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique.
- The exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT is consistent with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
- Spear phishing attacks often use social engineering to make the document appear legitimate to the victim. Therefore, it is plausible that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the infection occurs.

### Final Answer: Final Answer: A
