Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Malicious documents attached to emails.
2. Execution of embedded macros.
3. Downloading the Dridex loader.
4. The loader executing the OutputDebugStringW function.
5. Employing RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **OutputDebugStringW Function**: This function is often used for debugging purposes and can be a sign of anti-debugging techniques. However, it is not typically used as a primary anti-debugging technique in malware. It is more likely to be used for logging or debugging purposes.
- **RC4 Encryption**: This is a common technique used to obfuscate strings and evade detection. It is a well-known method to make the strings harder to understand and detect.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Malicious Documents and Macros**: These are common initial vectors for malware delivery.
2. **Dridex Loader**: Dridex is known for its sophisticated techniques, including obfuscation and anti-debugging.
3. **OutputDebugStringW Function**: While this function can be used for debugging, it is not a primary anti-debugging technique. It is more likely to be used for logging or debugging purposes.
4. **RC4 Encryption**: This is a common technique used to obfuscate strings and evade detection. It aligns well with the TTPs related to obfuscation and defense evasion.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Dridex loader will employ RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection, but it is less likely to use the OutputDebugStringW function as a primary anti-debugging technique.

**Final Answer: B: No**
