Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware.
2. Privilege escalation using specific tools.
3. Lateral movement using WMI and custom web shells.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Privilege Escalation (T1068)**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher-level access.
- **Execution (T1047)**: This tactic involves running code on the target system.
- **Reconnaissance (T1595.003)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: FIN13 is known to use native OS binaries and custom malware for reconnaissance.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The related TTPs mention T1068, which aligns with the use of tools like ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation.
- **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 is known to use WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement, such as BUSTEDPIPE.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This choice would imply that FIN13 does not use the specified tools and techniques for privilege escalation and lateral movement, which contradicts the known TTPs of FIN13.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: FIN13 is known to perform internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware, which matches the first part of the question.
- **Step 2**: The related TTPs for privilege escalation (T1068) include the use of tools like ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil, which are consistent with the question.
- **Step 3**: FIN13 is known to use WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement, which aligns with the final part of the question.

Given the alignment of the related TTPs with the described sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
