Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT29 (a known threat actor) has gained initial access to a system using publicly available exploits. The question then asks whether it is likely that the group will drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access to the network. This is a common method for maintaining persistence.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a foothold. This is a method for gaining initial access, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - APT29 is known for its sophisticated tactics, including the use of valid accounts (T1078) to maintain persistence. Given that the group has already gained initial access (T1133), it is highly likely that they would use valid accounts to maintain their presence on the network.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the known tactics of APT29. If the group has already gained initial access, it is unlikely that they would not take steps to maintain their presence, such as using valid accounts.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT29 is known for its persistence and use of valid accounts to maintain access.
- The group has already gained initial access using external remote services.
- It is logical and consistent with APT29's tactics to use valid accounts to maintain persistence after gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
