Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has achieved persistence and installed malware.
   - The question then asks if "Machete" (presumably the malware or attacker) is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device for the collection of sensitive information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's mention of copying files to a special USB device.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves logging keystrokes, which directly relates to the question's mention of logging keystrokes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Both techniques (T1025 and T1056.001) are relevant to the question, but they serve different purposes.
   - T1056.001 (Keylogging) is specifically about logging keystrokes, which is directly mentioned in the question.
   - T1025 (Data from Removable Media) is about copying files to a USB device, which is also mentioned in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question asks if "Machete" is likely to perform both actions: log keystrokes and copy files to a USB device.
   - Both actions are supported by the related TTPs.
   - The question does not specify which action is more likely or if both are equally likely.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that both actions are supported by the related TTPs and the question does not provide additional context to favor one over the other, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that "Machete" is likely to perform both actions.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best fits the question is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
