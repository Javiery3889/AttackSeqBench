Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
     - Establishing command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware.
     - Polling remote C&C servers for tasks and executing commands.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leave ransom notes in encrypted directories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which aligns with the ransomware's function of encrypting files.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for C&C communication, which is different from the asymmetric RSA encryption used by ransomware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that the group uses symmetric cryptography for C&C communication, which is different from the asymmetric RSA encryption used by ransomware.
   - The question asks about the deployment of Hermes ransomware, which involves encrypting files using RSA encryption. This is a different technique from the symmetric cryptography used for C&C communication.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (establishing C&C, polling for tasks, and then deploying ransomware) is plausible and aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like Lazarus.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Lazarus group is known for using a variety of techniques, including both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
   - Establishing C&C communication and polling for tasks are standard initial steps in an attack.
   - Deploying ransomware to encrypt files and demand a ransom is a common follow-up action after establishing control over a system.
   - The use of RSA encryption for ransomware is a well-documented technique used by ransomware groups.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is that the Lazarus group would indeed deploy Hermes ransomware after establishing C&C communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
