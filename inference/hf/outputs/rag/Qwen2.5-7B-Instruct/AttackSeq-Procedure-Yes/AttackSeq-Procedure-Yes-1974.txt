Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, after using phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion, it is likely that threat actors targeting Solar Winds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the types of reconnaissance techniques that are relevant:
- **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization.
- **T1589.002-Email Addresses**: This technique involves collecting email addresses, which can be part of the reconnaissance process.
- **T1591.002-Business Relationships**: This technique involves gathering information about business relationships, which can also be part of the reconnaissance process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, as gathering victim organization information (T1591) is a common practice in reconnaissance. The use of phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion suggests that the threat actors are already engaging in reconnaissance to identify potential targets.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the common practice of gathering victim organization information during reconnaissance.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where phishing emails are used as an initial point of intrusion, which is a common method for reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs specifically mention gathering victim organization information (T1591) as a technique used in reconnaissance.
- Given that the threat actors are already using phishing emails, it is highly likely that they will continue to gather victim organization information as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

### Final Answer: Yes
