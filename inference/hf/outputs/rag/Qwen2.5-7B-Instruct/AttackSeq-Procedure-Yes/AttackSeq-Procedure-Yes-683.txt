Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Stuxnet has exploited two vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) for lateral movement within the network. The question then asks whether it is likely that Stuxnet will communicate with its C&C servers using encrypted channels to send system information and receive commands or updates.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This TTP is relevant as it describes the use of vulnerabilities to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This TTP is relevant as it describes the use of internal proxies to communicate with C&C servers, which can be a method to avoid detection and use encrypted channels.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of encrypted channels for communication with C&C servers, which is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure secure communication.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1090.001-Internal Proxy, suggest the use of internal proxies, which can be used to establish encrypted communication channels.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the typical behavior of advanced malware like Stuxnet, which would likely use encrypted channels to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Stuxnet, being a sophisticated piece of malware, would likely use encrypted channels to communicate with its C&C servers to avoid detection and ensure secure data transmission.
- The related TTPs, especially T1090.001-Internal Proxy, support the use of internal proxies, which can be used to establish encrypted communication channels.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Stuxnet would indeed use encrypted channels for communication with its C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A**
