Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where APT15 has gained initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. It then asks whether APT15 is likely to use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves the attacker using compromised domain accounts to gain access to the network. This aligns with the initial access through stolen domain administrator credentials.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves the attacker accessing credentials stored in password stores. While this is a relevant technique, it is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager**: This technique involves the attacker accessing credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager. This is also relevant but not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Mimikatz for OS Credential Dumping**: Mimikatz is a tool commonly used for credential dumping, which involves extracting credentials from memory or other storage locations on a Windows system. This aligns with the technique T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager.
- **Deployment of RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS**: These tools are used for execution evasion and command execution. The question suggests that after credential dumping, these tools are deployed.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: APT15 has gained initial access through stolen domain administrator credentials.
2. **Credential Dumping**: Given the context, it is highly likely that APT15 would use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping to gather additional credentials from the compromised system.
3. **Execution Evasion and Command Execution**: After obtaining the necessary credentials, APT15 would likely deploy tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.

Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A
