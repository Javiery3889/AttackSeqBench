Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by an APT group (Naikon) to evade defenses and gather information. The specific TTPs mentioned are:
1. Evading defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows.
2. Utilizing fileless loading techniques.
3. Gathering information about active processes.
4. Communicating with the C&C server using HTTP and TCP protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control communications.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using one protocol to hide or tunnel another protocol.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- **Evading Defenses**: The question mentions operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques, which are plausible evasion techniques.
- **Gathering Information**: The question states that the group gathers information about active processes, which is a common TTP in the reconnaissance phase.
- **Communication**: The question specifies that the group uses HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server. T1071.001-Web Protocols directly supports this.
- **Backdoor Usage**: The question does not explicitly mention the use of the Aria-body backdoor, but it is plausible that such a backdoor could be used to gather information and establish communication.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This choice would imply that the group does not use the Aria-body backdoor, does not gather information about active processes, and does not use HTTP and TCP for communication. This contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that align well with the provided related TTPs.
- The use of fileless loading and limited time window operations for C&C servers is a common evasion technique.
- Gathering information about active processes is a standard reconnaissance activity.
- Using HTTP and TCP for communication is directly supported by the related TTPs.
- The Aria-body backdoor is not explicitly mentioned, but it is plausible that such a backdoor could be used in this context.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is supported by the provided related TTPs.

**Final Answer: Yes**
