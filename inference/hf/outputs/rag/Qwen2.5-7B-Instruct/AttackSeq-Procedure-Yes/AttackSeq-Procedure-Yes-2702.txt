Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aurora malware:
1. Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
2. Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.
3. Communicating with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL, which aligns with the first action in the question.
- **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves using services and registry permissions to persist on the system, but it does not directly relate to the communication with C&C servers.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control communication, but the question specifies port 443, which is a standard HTTPS port.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the actions described in the question. The malware is likely to use a weak custom encryption scheme for communication with C&C servers over port 443, which is a common practice for malware to avoid detection.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the actions described in the question. If the malware is using a weak custom encryption scheme, it is unlikely that it would not communicate with C&C servers over port 443.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware modifies the file-time of a dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL and loads it into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.
- The related TTPs confirm that the malware is likely to use a weak custom encryption scheme for communication with C&C servers, and it is common for malware to use port 443 (HTTPS) for such communication.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will communicate with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

**Final Answer: A**
