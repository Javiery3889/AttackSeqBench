Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a malicious Excel file attached to a phishing email is designed to:
1. Display a fake invoice.
2. Run malicious code in the background.
3. Install ISMAgent (a specific malware).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious file (e.g., an Excel file) to a specific individual or group. This aligns with the scenario where a phishing email is sent to targeted individuals.
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file. This aligns with the scenario where the Excel file is designed to run malicious code.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The scenario describes a phishing email with a malicious Excel file, which aligns with **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**.
- The Excel file is designed to display a fake invoice and run malicious code in the background, which aligns with **T1204.002-Malicious File**.
- The installation of ISMAgent is a specific action that would occur after the malicious code is executed, which is consistent with the execution of the malicious file.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
