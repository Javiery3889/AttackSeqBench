Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers to gain initial access.
2. Using the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
3. Employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This TTP involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware across a network.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This TTP is about gaining initial access to a network and then using removable media to spread malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After gaining initial access and pivoting to the entire network, the use of an Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices for lateral movement is a plausible next step.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. If the attackers are using the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network, it is reasonable to assume they would then use an Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices for further lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attackers first gain initial access, then pivot to the entire network, and finally use an Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices for lateral movement.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1091-Replication Through Removable Media, support the use of removable media (USB devices) for spreading malware.
- The sequence described in the question is logical and consistent with the TTPs provided.

### Final Answer: Yes
