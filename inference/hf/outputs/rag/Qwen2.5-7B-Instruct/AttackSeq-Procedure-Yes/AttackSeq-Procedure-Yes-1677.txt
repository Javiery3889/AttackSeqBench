Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec.
2. Services are stopped.
3. Windows Defender is disabled.
4. The question asks if it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact.
- **T1489-Service Stop**: This technique involves stopping services to evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. After stopping services and disabling Windows Defender, the next logical step would be to encrypt data, which is a common tactic for ransomware.
  - The TTPs T1486 and T1489 support this sequence, as stopping services and disabling security measures are preparatory steps for data encryption.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence. If the ransomware has already stopped services and disabled security measures, it is highly likely that the next step would be to encrypt data, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question (stopping services and disabling security measures) are preparatory steps for data encryption.
- The related TTPs (T1486 and T1489) support this sequence.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that the ransomware will proceed to encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

**Final Answer: A**
