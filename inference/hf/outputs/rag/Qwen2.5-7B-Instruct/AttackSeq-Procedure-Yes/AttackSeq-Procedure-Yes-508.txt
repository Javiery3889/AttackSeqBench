Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions in a cyber attack:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
2. It is asked if the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography (RSA) for securing communications.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of actions. The use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication suggests a secure and established C2 channel. Given that the SombRAT backdoor is known to be used in similar campaigns, it is plausible that it would exfiltrate data over this secure C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of actions. If the C2 channel is established and secured with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges, it would be illogical for the SombRAT backdoor not to use this channel for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a secure C2 channel established using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
- The SombRAT backdoor is known to be used in similar campaigns and would likely leverage the established secure C2 channel for exfiltration.
- The related TTPs support the use of secure communication channels for both C2 and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: Yes**
