Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Discovery activities are performed to collect system and network information.
2. The TDrop2 malware communicates with C2 servers.
3. The communication uses encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
4. The base64 encoding uses a custom alphabet.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves the use of standard encoding methods, such as base64, to obfuscate the content of the communication.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves the use of non-standard encoding methods, which could include custom alphabets.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the use of base64 encoding, which is a standard encoding method.
  - It also allows for the use of a custom base64 alphabet, which is a non-standard encoding method.
  - The combination of standard and non-standard encoding methods is plausible in a sophisticated malware like TDrop2, as it can help evade detection and analysis.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that TDrop2 does not use base64 encoding or a custom base64 alphabet, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question explicitly mentions that the malware uses base64-encoded commands, which is a standard encoding method.
- The use of a custom base64 alphabet is a non-standard encoding method, which is also mentioned in the question.
- Both standard and non-standard encoding methods are covered by the related TTPs.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that TDrop2 uses both standard and non-standard encoding methods, as described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
