Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery of local IP address and system time.
2. Collection of files from newly inserted removable media.
3. Notification to the C&C server about these files.
4. Compression of the collected files.
5. Sending the compressed files to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the collection phase of the attack:
- **T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting files from newly inserted removable media.
- **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves compressing or archiving the collected data, which aligns with the question's mention of compressing the collected files.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial discovery of the local IP address and system time.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor is likely to perform all the actions described in the question.
  - It aligns with the techniques T1025, T1560, and T1005, which cover the collection of data from removable media, archiving the collected data, and collecting data from the local system, respectively.
  - The sequence of actions (discovery, collection, notification, compression, and sending) is plausible and consistent with the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the backdoor is unlikely to perform the actions described in the question.
  - There is no direct contradiction in the related TTPs that would support this answer. The techniques mentioned do not preclude the backdoor from performing these actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that are consistent with the related TTPs.
- The techniques T1025, T1560, and T1005 support the actions of collecting files from removable media, compressing the collected files, and sending them to the C&C server.
- The sequence of actions (discovery, collection, notification, compression, and sending) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A
