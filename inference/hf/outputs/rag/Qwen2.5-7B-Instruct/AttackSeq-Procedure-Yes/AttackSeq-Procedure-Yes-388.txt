Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. **Collection Phase**: Vyveva's backdoor compresses files with zlib for exfiltration.
2. **Command and Control (C&C) Phase**: The question asks if it is likely to encrypt C&C traffic using the XOR operation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection. However, it does not directly relate to C&C traffic.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves compressing or archiving files using a custom method, which aligns with the compression of files using zlib mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Vyveva's backdoor would encrypt C&C traffic using the XOR operation. However, the related TTPs do not provide any information about C&C traffic encryption.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Vyveva's backdoor would not encrypt C&C traffic using the XOR operation. Given that the related TTPs do not mention C&C traffic encryption, this choice is more plausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs: file compression for exfiltration and a potential encryption method for C&C traffic.
- The related TTPs focus on file compression and do not mention C&C traffic encryption.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Vyveva's backdoor would not use the XOR operation to encrypt C&C traffic.

**Final Answer: B: No**
