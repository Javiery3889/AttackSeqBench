Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities during the discovery phase:
1. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
2. Scanning for deleted files.
3. Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.

The question specifically asks if Regin (a known malware) is likely to perform the third activity after the first two.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization (T1033)**: This is a common technique used in the discovery phase to understand the environment.
- **Scanning for Deleted Files (T1027)**: This is also a common technique used to find and collect deleted files, which can be useful for exfiltration or further analysis.
- **Monitoring Network Traffic and Sniffing Low-Level Network Traffic (T1040)**: This technique is directly related to the question and is a known tactic used by malware like Regin to collect data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization (T1033)**: This is a standard step in the discovery phase to understand the target environment.
2. **Scanning for Deleted Files (T1027)**: This is another common step to find valuable data that might have been deleted.
3. **Monitoring Network Traffic and Sniffing Low-Level Network Traffic (T1040)**: Given that Regin is known for its sophisticated network-based data collection capabilities, it is highly likely that it would perform this step to collect additional data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
