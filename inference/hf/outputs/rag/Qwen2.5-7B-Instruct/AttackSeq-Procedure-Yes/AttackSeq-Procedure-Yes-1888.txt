Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an adversary (FIN13) after obtaining credentials. The sequence includes:
1. Obtaining credentials via process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.
2. Gathering information on services using system service discovery.
3. Moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain unauthorized access. While it is related to credential access, it does not directly describe the process of obtaining credentials via LSASS memory dumping or trojanized KeePass binaries.
- **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique specifically describes the process of obtaining credentials by dumping the LSASS process memory. This directly aligns with the first part of the question.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would include:
1. **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This is the technique used to obtain credentials via LSASS memory dumping.
2. **System Service Discovery (implied by the question but not directly listed as a TTP)**: This is the next step where the adversary gathers information on services.
3. **WMI and Custom Web Shells**: These are the methods used for lateral movement.

Since the question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally, and given that the related TTPs align with the credential access techniques, the answer is affirmative.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
