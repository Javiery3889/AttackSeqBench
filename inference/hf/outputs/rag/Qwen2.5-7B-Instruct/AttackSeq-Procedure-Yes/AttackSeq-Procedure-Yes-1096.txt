Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker:
1. Reconnaissance using system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`.
2. Gaining initial access through malicious documents with job offers.
3. Network share discovery using `net user` and `SMBMap`.
4. Leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** The question mentions gaining initial access through malicious documents.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** The question asks about network share discovery and leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance:** The use of `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` is a common form of reconnaissance.
- **Initial Access:** The question states that the initial access was gained through malicious documents.
- **Network Share Discovery:** The related TTPs do not explicitly mention `net user` or `SMBMap`, but `SMB/Windows Admin Shares` (T1021.002) is relevant.
- **Lateral Movement:** The question asks about leveraging compromised privileged accounts, which aligns with the tactic of Lateral Movement.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access:** The question confirms that the initial access was gained through malicious documents, which is a common method used by the Lazarus Group.
2. **Reconnaissance:** The use of `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` is a standard form of reconnaissance.
3. **Network Share Discovery:** While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention `net user` or `SMBMap`, the technique T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) is relevant to network share discovery.
4. **Lateral Movement:** Leveraging compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement is a common tactic used by the Lazarus Group.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the tactics and techniques commonly used by the Lazarus Group.

Final Answer: A: Yes
