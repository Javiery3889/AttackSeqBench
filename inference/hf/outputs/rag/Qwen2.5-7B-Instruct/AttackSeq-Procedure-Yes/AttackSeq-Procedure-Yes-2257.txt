Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence starting with the delivery of a COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email. The next steps in the sequence are:
1. Execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet.
2. Running the script at memory level.
3. Ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious script or executable.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding a registry entry or shortcut to the startup folder to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs:
    - **Initial Access**: The delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email.
    - **Execution**: The execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet.
    - **Memory Execution**: Running the script at memory level.
    - **Persistence**: Ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
  - The related TTPs (T1053.005 and T1547.001) directly support the persistence techniques mentioned in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the attack sequence does not follow the described steps, which contradicts the related TTPs and the attack sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs.
- The execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet and running it at memory level are plausible steps in an attack sequence.
- Ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks are well-documented techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: Yes**
