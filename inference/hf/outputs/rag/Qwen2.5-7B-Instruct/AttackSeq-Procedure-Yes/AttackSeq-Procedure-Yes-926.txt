Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an initial infection and lateral movement through infected servers and USB devices. It then asks whether the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to use a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media like USB drives.
- **Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows administrative shares for lateral movement.
- **Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which can include application layer protocols.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1091 (Replication Through Removable Media)**: This is relevant to the initial infection and lateral movement through USB devices.
- **Technique T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares)**: This is relevant to the initial infection and lateral movement through network shares.
- **Technique T1104 (Multi-Stage Channels)**: This is relevant to the command and control aspect, specifically using application layer protocols for C2.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Infection and Lateral Movement**: The question mentions using initially infected servers and USB devices for lateral movement. This aligns with T1091 and T1021.002.
2. **Command and Control**: The question asks about the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols. This aligns with T1104.

### Final Answer
Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
