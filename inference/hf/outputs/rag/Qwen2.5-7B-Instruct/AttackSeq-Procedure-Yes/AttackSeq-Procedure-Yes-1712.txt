Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda uses a double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in a spearphishing campaign to evade defenses. The question then asks if Mustang Panda is likely to use documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension**: This technique involves using file extensions to evade detection. This aligns with the double extension trick mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using malicious links in spearphishing emails to deliver malware or other malicious content. This is relevant to the spearphishing campaign mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after using the double extension trick, Mustang Panda would likely use documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.
  - Given that the double extension trick is a method to evade defenses, it is logical that the attackers would continue to use sophisticated techniques to maintain their presence and communicate with their C2 infrastructure.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that after using the double extension trick, Mustang Panda would not use documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like Mustang Panda, who would likely employ multiple techniques to ensure persistence and maintain communication with their C2 infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The double extension trick (T1036.007) is a method to evade detection, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
- Spearphishing (T1566.002) is a method to initially gain access, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
- After gaining initial access, attackers like Mustang Panda would likely use additional techniques to maintain persistence and communicate with their C2 infrastructure.
- Connecting to C2 domains and IP addresses is a common method for maintaining communication and control over the compromised system.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Mustang Panda would indeed use documents attempting to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy.

**Final Answer: A**
