### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers initially compromise endpoints using domain administrative credentials obtained through credential access.
   - The attackers then use this initial compromise to discover additional endpoints.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This indicates that the attackers initially gained access using domain accounts.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This suggests that the attackers are maintaining access using domain accounts.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This implies that the attackers are trying to escalate their privileges, likely to gain higher-level access such as Domain Administrator.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves initial compromise, discovery of additional endpoints, and then moving across the infrastructure.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attackers are using domain accounts for initial access and persistence, and are likely trying to escalate their privileges to gain higher-level access.
   - Given the context, it is plausible that the attackers would aim to find admin-level credentials to escalate their privileges and move across the entire infrastructure.
