Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initial Access: Distribution of a payload via a DMG containing a shell script.
2. Persistence: Installation of a persistent Chrome browser extension.
3. Defense Evasion: Use of an animated image to evade macOS security technology.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions**: This technique involves installing a browser extension to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1176-Browser Extensions**: This technique aligns with the persistence phase and the installation of a Chrome browser extension.
- **Technique T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is more related to loading a malicious DLL, which is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Technique T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is more related to hiding artifacts, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The distribution of a payload via a DMG containing a shell script is a valid Initial Access technique.
2. **Persistence**: The installation of a persistent Chrome browser extension is a valid Persistence technique (T1176).
3. **Defense Evasion**: The use of an animated image to evade macOS security technology is a valid Defense Evasion technique (T1564).

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
