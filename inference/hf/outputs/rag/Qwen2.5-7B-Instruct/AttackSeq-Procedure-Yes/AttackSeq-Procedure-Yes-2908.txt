Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
2. Using a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network.
3. Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves gaining access to domain accounts, which aligns with the first step of the question.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys**: This technique involves stealing private keys, which could include a stolen VPN certificate, aligning with the second step of the question.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is relevant to the initial steps of credential access and domain account access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that APT15 would follow the sequence described in the question.
  - Gaining domain administrator credentials (T1078.002) and using a stolen VPN certificate (T1552.004) are both plausible steps in an APT15 attack.
  - Deploying backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) for execution is a common final step in an APT attack.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that APT15 would not follow the sequence described in the question.
  - Given the techniques and tactics involved, it is less likely that APT15 would skip the credential access and remote access steps before deploying backdoors.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the techniques and tactics provided in the related TTPs.
- Gaining domain administrator credentials and using a stolen VPN certificate are logical steps in an APT attack.
- Deploying backdoors for execution is a common final step in such attacks.

**Final Answer: Yes**
