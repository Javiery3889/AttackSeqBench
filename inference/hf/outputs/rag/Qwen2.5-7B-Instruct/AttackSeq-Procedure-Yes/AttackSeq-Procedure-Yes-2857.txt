Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Scanning the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
2. Identifying potential expansion points.
3. Using a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain account credentials.
4. Using hacktools to move laterally within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step in the attack lifecycle, where the adversary gains access to the target network.
- **Network Service Discovery (T1046 - Technique):** This involves identifying open ports and services on the network.
- **Credential Access (Tactic):** This is the process of obtaining credentials, which can be done through various techniques such as OS Credential Dumping (T1003 - Technique).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1078 - Valid Accounts):** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to the network. However, the question does not mention the use of valid accounts directly.
- **Network Service Discovery (T1046):** This is the scanning of the network for open ports, which aligns with the first step in the question.
- **Credential Access (Tactic):** This involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the third step in the question.
- **OS Credential Dumping (T1003):** This is a specific technique under Credential Access, which involves dumping credentials from the operating system. This aligns with the third step in the question.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** This involves moving from one system to another within the network, which aligns with the fourth step in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The scanning of the network for open ports (8080, 5900, and 40) aligns with Network Service Discovery (T1046).
2. The identification of potential expansion points is a logical next step after discovering open services.
3. The use of a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain account credentials aligns with OS Credential Dumping (T1003), which is a technique under Credential Access.
4. The use of hacktools to move laterally within the network aligns with Lateral Movement.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Network Service Discovery (T1046)
- Credential Access (Tactic)
- OS Credential Dumping (T1003)
- Lateral Movement

### Final Answer: A
