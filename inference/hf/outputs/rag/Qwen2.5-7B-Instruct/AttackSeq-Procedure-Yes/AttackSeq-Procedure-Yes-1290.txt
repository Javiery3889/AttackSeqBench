Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server via the domain `hxxp://outl00k[.]net`.
2. The campaign then carries out activities involving the execution of PowerShell scripts.
3. These PowerShell scripts are triggered by a macro in a Word document.
4. The macro scripts are obfuscated to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution.
- **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for execution, which is often used in macros.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - The question describes a sequence where a backdoor communicates with a C&C server, then executes PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document, and these scripts are obfuscated.
  - The related TTPs mention T1059.001 (PowerShell) and T1059.005 (Visual Basic), which align with the described activities.
  - The obfuscation of the macro scripts (T1059.005) is a common technique to evade detection, which fits the scenario described.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the sequence of activities described in the question does not align with the related TTPs.
  - However, the related TTPs do support the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and obfuscation of scripts (T1059.005), which are consistent with the described activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where a backdoor communicates with a C&C server, then executes PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document, and these scripts are obfuscated.
- The related TTPs support the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and obfuscation of scripts (T1059.005), which align with the described activities.
- Therefore, the sequence of activities described in the question is plausible based on the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: Yes**
