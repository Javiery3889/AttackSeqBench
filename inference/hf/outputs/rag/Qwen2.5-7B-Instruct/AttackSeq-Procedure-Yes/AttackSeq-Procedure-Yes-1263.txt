Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial access via a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
2. Use of Blind Eagle (a technique or tool) that incorporates PowerShell scripts with obfuscation for defense evasion.
3. Placement of a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the use of PowerShell scripts.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves placing scripts or executables in the Startup folder to ensure persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands. This aligns with the use of PowerShell for execution.
- **Blind Eagle**: Blind Eagle is a technique that involves the use of PowerShell scripts with obfuscation for defense evasion. This aligns with the use of T1059.001-PowerShell and the need for obfuscation.
- **Persistence**: The question states that a VBScript is placed in the Startup folder to ensure persistence. This aligns with the use of T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves multiple TTPs that are logically connected and align with the related TTPs.
- The use of PowerShell for execution (T1059.001) and the incorporation of obfuscation (Blind Eagle) are consistent with the described sequence.
- The placement of a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence (T1547.001) is a common and effective method to ensure long-term access.

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed the one described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
