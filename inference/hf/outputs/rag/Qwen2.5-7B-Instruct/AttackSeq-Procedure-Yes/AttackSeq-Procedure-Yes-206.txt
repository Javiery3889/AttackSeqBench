Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access).
2. Collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types (Discovery).
3. Reading file contents.
4. Exfiltrating the collected data to a C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network, system, and users. This aligns with the question's mention of collecting system information.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the LSASS memory to extract credentials. This aligns with the question's mention of using a custom version of Mimikatz for credential access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after dumping credentials, the actor (FamousSparrow) will proceed to collect system information as part of the Discovery phase.
  - The related TTPs support this sequence, as T1082-System Information Discovery is a valid technique in the Discovery phase.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that after dumping credentials, the actor will not collect system information and will instead proceed directly to reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of an attacker who would likely gather as much information as possible before exfiltrating data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the actor first gains credentials and then collects additional information about the system.
- The related TTPs confirm that collecting system information is a valid and common step in the Discovery phase.
- The sequence of actions described in the question and supported by the related TTPs makes Answer Choice A the most plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
