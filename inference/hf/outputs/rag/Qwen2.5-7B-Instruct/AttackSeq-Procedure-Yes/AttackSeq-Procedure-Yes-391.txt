Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the backdoor:
1. Obtaining file and directory listings
2. Obtaining the local IP address
3. Retrieving system time and time zone

The question then asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will compress files before exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's time and time zone, which aligns with the third action in the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the first two actions in the question (file and directory listings, and local IP address).
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves transferring data to a command and control (C&C) server, which is the final step in the sequence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Technique T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique covers the initial collection of data, which includes file and directory listings and the local IP address.
- **Technique T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique covers the retrieval of system time and time zone, which is the third action in the question.
- **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique covers the final step of transferring the collected data to the C&C server.

The question does not explicitly mention file compression as part of the sequence. The related TTPs focus on data collection and exfiltration but do not include a specific technique for file compression.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of data collection actions (file and directory listings, local IP address, and system time and time zone).
- The related TTPs confirm that these actions are part of the data collection and exfiltration process.
- There is no mention or indication in the related TTPs that file compression is part of the sequence.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence does not include file compression as a step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
