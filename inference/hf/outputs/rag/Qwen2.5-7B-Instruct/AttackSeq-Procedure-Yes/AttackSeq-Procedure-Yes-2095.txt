Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents employing the remote template technique.
2. Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool.
3. Initiating a multi-stage infection chain.
4. Creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence
- Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents using the remote template technique. This is a valid initial access method.
- **Exploitation**: The question then mentions exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool. This is a plausible method for exploiting a specific vulnerability.
- **Multi-Stage Infection Chain**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, this is a common practice in multi-stage attacks to ensure the persistence and spread of malware.
- **Persistence**: The question concludes with creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence. This is directly related to the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique, which is a valid method for maintaining persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the TTPs provided, especially the T1053.005-Scheduled Task for persistence.
- The multi-stage infection chain, while not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, is a common practice in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- The use of spear-phishing with malicious DOCX documents and exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool is a plausible and sophisticated method for initial access and exploitation.

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the provided TTPs and the common practices in APTs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed the one described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
