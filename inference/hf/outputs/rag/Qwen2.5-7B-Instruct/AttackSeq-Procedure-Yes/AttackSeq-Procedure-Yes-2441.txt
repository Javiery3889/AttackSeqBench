Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Elise malware:
1. **Discovery**: Collects system information such as IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration.
2. **Command and Control (C2)**: Communicates with a hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14 using an application layer protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and system configuration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols, which indicates that the malware is likely to use web protocols for C2 communication.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of web protocols for C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware performing discovery and then communicating with a C2 server.
- The related TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to use web protocols for C2 communication.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will use web protocols for C2 communication after performing discovery.

### Final Answer: A
