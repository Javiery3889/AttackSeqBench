Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.
2. Leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts.
3. Use WMI for lateral movement across the victim network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques and tactics used:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique is about maintaining access to a network by creating or modifying user accounts.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**: This technique involves using WMI to execute code or commands on remote systems.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process memory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gaining Credentials**: The question mentions gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing, which aligns with the T1003.001-LSASS Memory technique.
- **Gathering Information on User Accounts**: The question asks if FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts. This step is not directly covered by the provided TTPs, but it is a logical next step after gaining credentials.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question mentions using WMI for lateral movement, which aligns with the T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gaining Credentials**: The question starts with gaining credentials, which is correctly aligned with the T1003.001-LSASS Memory technique.
2. **Gathering Information on User Accounts**: After gaining credentials, the next logical step is to gather information on user accounts. While the provided TTPs do not explicitly mention this step, it is a common practice in internal reconnaissance.
3. **Lateral Movement**: The final step is using WMI for lateral movement, which is correctly aligned with the T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation technique.

Given the sequence of actions and the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Gaining credentials (T1003.001-LSASS Memory)
- Gathering information on user accounts (not explicitly covered but a logical step)
- Lateral movement (T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation)

### Final Answer: A: Yes
