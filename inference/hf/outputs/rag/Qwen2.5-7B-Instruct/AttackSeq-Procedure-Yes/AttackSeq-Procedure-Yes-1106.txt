Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names.
2. Leveraging untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion.
3. Utilizing command-and-control infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves disguising malware to appear as legitimate software or files.
- **T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique involves using fake digital signatures to evade detection.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malware to appear as legitimate software or files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This TTP aligns with the first part of the question, where the malware is disguised with legitimate-looking document names.
  - **T1553.002-Code Signing**: This TTP aligns with the second part of the question, where untrusted and faked digital signatures are used for defense evasion.
  - **T1036-Masquerading**: This TTP also aligns with the first part of the question, reinforcing the use of legitimate-looking names or locations.
  - The third part of the question about command-and-control infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services is not directly covered by the provided TTPs but is a common practice in the context of TTPs related to command and control (C2).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not likely, which contradicts the alignment of the TTPs with the described actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the provided TTPs:
  - T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location for disguising malware.
  - T1553.002-Code Signing for using untrusted and faked digital signatures.
  - T1036-Masquerading for reinforcing the use of legitimate-looking names or locations.
- The command-and-control infrastructure part is a common practice but not directly covered by the provided TTPs, but it is consistent with the overall context of the question.

### Final Answer: Yes
