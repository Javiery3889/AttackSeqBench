Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15:
1. Using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
2. Stealing a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
3. Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
4. Leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques used:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using compromised domain accounts to gain access to the network.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain higher privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - **Initial Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials, which aligns with T1078.002-Domain Accounts.
  - **Privilege Escalation**: Stealing a VPN certificate and deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS can be seen as part of privilege escalation.
  - **Defense Evasion**: Using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution aligns with T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control, which is a form of defense evasion.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that APT15 did not deploy backdoors or use RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings, which contradicts the sequence of actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.
- APT15's actions of obtaining domain administrator credentials, stealing a VPN certificate, deploying backdoors, and using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings are all consistent with the techniques and tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
