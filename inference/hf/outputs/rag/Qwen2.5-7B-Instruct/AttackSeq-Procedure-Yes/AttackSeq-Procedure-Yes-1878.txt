Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 (a known APT group) will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the compromise of legitimate credentials to gain access to systems.
- **Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory** - This technique involves dumping the LSASS process memory to extract credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Information on Network and Host Configurations**: This is a common initial step in reconnaissance, where attackers gather information about the target environment to understand the network topology, host configurations, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Using Native OS Binaries for Reconnaissance**: This is a plausible method as native OS binaries are readily available and can be used to gather detailed information about the network and hosts without raising suspicion.
- **Dumping LSASS Process Memory**: This is a well-known technique used by APT groups to extract credentials from the LSASS process, which is a common target for credential theft.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: FIN13 would likely start by gathering information on the network and host configurations to understand the environment.
2. **Using Native OS Binaries**: They would use native OS tools to gather detailed information, which is a stealthy and effective method.
3. **Credential Dumping**: After gathering the necessary information, they would proceed to dump the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the typical attack patterns of APT groups like FIN13.

Final Answer: A
