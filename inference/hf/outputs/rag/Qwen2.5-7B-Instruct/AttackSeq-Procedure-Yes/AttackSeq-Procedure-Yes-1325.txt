Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types.
2. Using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
3. Exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves searching for and collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which aligns with the second part of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives.
  - Given the related TTPs, this sequence makes sense as it follows the logical steps of first collecting data from removable media and then collecting clipboard data.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke would not use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives.
  - This does not align with the logical sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is first collected from removable drives and then from the clipboard.
- The related TTPs confirm that both of these actions are part of the collection tactic.
- Therefore, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would follow this sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A**
