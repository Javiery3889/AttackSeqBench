Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where adversaries have already performed a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems. The next step in the attack sequence is to establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves the use of dynamic data exchange to execute code or scripts.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripts to execute code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, as both T1559.002 and T1059.005 involve the use of scripts (Dynamic Data Exchange and VBA) to execute code, which is a common method for establishing C2 connections.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it suggests that the adversaries would not use scripts to establish a C2 connection, which contradicts the provided TTPs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where adversaries have already delivered the BlackEnergy 3 RAT via a phishing campaign.
- The next step is to establish a C2 connection.
- The related TTPs mention the use of Dynamic Data Exchange and VBA scripts, which are common methods for establishing C2 connections.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that the adversaries would use these methods to establish a C2 connection.

**Final Answer: A**
