Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an encrypted HTTP cookie header is used for communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers to evade detection. It then asks if it is likely that ChChes (a malware family) will receive and load modules from these C&C servers to execute shell commands and perform file uploads or downloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to a target system from a C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described scenario. Using encrypted HTTP cookies for C2 communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a common evasion technique. The malware (ChChes) is likely to receive and load modules from the C2 server to perform specific actions (shell commands, file uploads/downloads) as part of its operation (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described scenario. If the malware is using encrypted HTTP cookies for C2 communication, it is reasonable to assume that it would also receive and load modules from the C2 server to perform its intended actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where encrypted HTTP cookies are used for C2 communication, which is a common technique to evade detection.
- The related TTPs confirm that malware often receives and loads modules from C2 servers to perform specific actions.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that ChChes would receive and load modules from the C2 server to execute shell commands and perform file uploads/downloads.

**Final Answer: A**
