Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration.
2. Staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.
3. A query about whether WinDealer will collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Collection**
- **Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves the attacker staging data locally before exfiltration. This aligns with the action of staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.
- **Collection Tactic**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target environment. Collecting data from removable media and targeting relevant folders are actions that fall under this tactic.

Given the sequence described in the question, the logical next step after staging data in the %TEMP% folder would be to collect more data from the environment, including removable media and relevant folders, before exfiltrating the data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions that include discovery, staging, and exfiltration.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the tactic of collection is relevant, and the technique of local data staging is also relevant.
3. After staging data in the %TEMP% folder, the next logical step would be to collect more data from the environment, which aligns with the collection tactic.
4. Collecting data from removable media and targeting relevant folders are specific actions that fall under the collection tactic.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that WinDealer will indeed collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

### Final Answer: A
