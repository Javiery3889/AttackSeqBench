Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Emissary Panda:
1. Network reconnaissance to identify systems vulnerable to EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144).
2. Exploitation of the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
3. Uploading Mimikatz and custom backdoors like HyperBro for execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
- **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question describes a sequence of actions that align with this tactic.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access to a system. The question mentions exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability, which is a public-facing application, to install webshells. This aligns with the T1190 technique.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Network Reconnaissance:** Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems. This is a common initial step in any attack.
2. **Exploitation of EternalBlue:** The question mentions EternalBlue, which is a known exploit for the SMBv1 protocol. This is a valid initial access method.
3. **Exploitation of SharePoint Vulnerability:** The question then describes exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells. This is a plausible step as SharePoint is a public-facing application and can be exploited for initial access.
4. **Uploading Tools:** After gaining initial access, the question states that Mimikatz and custom backdoors like HyperBro were uploaded for execution. This is a common follow-up step to establish a persistent presence on the network.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
