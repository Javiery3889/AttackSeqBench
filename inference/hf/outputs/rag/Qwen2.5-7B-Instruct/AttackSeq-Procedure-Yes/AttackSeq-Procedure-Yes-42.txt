Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where KONNI malware has established communication with C2 domains using HTTP connections hosted by a free web hosting provider. It then asks whether the malware is likely to steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before uploading the stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves the malware collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the question's mention of stealing files, keystrokes, and screenshots.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves the malware transmitting the collected data to the C2 infrastructure, which aligns with the question's mention of uploading the stolen data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described scenario. The malware is likely to steal data (keystrokes and screenshots) from the local system (T1005) and then upload this data to the C2 infrastructure (T1041).
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described scenario. If the malware is stealing data and uploading it, it would not be "no."

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware steals data from the local system and then uploads it to the C2 infrastructure.
- The related TTPs confirm that the malware is likely to use techniques for data collection (T1005) and exfiltration (T1041).
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed steal files from the local system and upload the stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A**
