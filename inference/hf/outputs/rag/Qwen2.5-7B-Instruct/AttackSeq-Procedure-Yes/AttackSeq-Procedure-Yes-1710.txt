Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - Turla uses an encrypted file system for defense evasion.
   - Turla stores stolen data and tools using this encrypted file system.
   - The question asks if Turla is likely to include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves gathering data from local systems, which aligns with the collection of stolen data and tools.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves using a hidden file system to evade detection, which matches Turla's use of an encrypted file system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, which is directly related to the question about collecting data from information repositories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Turla is known for its sophisticated methods of data collection and evasion.
   - The use of an encrypted file system (T1564.005) for defense evasion suggests that Turla is capable of using advanced techniques to store and protect stolen data.
   - Document stealers (which would be a specialized tool for T1213-Data from Information Repositories) are a common technique used by APTs to gather sensitive information from various sources, including documents.

Given that Turla is known for its advanced and specialized tools, it is highly likely that Turla would include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
