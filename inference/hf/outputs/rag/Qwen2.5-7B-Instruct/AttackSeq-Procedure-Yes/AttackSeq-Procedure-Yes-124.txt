Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Agrius uses an 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP.
2. Actions include updating relays or downloading files.
3. The question then asks if it is likely that Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', which later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the destruction of data, which aligns with the question's focus on data destruction.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files, which is a form of data destruction.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's scenario where Agrius eventually deployed wipers (which are a form of data destruction) to destroy data on targeted systems.
  - The related TTPs, particularly T1485-Data Destruction, support the idea of data destruction.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the scenario described in the question, as it contradicts the likelihood of deploying wipers to destroy data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions leading to the deployment of wipers, which are a form of data destruction.
- The related TTPs, specifically T1485-Data Destruction, support the idea of data destruction.
- The scenario described in the question and the supporting TTPs both point towards the likelihood of data destruction.

**Final Answer: Yes**
