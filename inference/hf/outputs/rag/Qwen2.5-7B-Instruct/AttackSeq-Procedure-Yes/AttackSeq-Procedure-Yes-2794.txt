Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where Grandoreiro first uses tricks like API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation. After this evasion, the malware is expected to collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to understand the target environment.
- **Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is used to evade detection by virtualization and sandbox environments.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to avoid detection or disruption by defensive measures.
- **Technique: T1497.001-System Checks** - This technique involves the adversary checking the system to ensure it is not in a virtualized or sandboxed environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Evasion Techniques (T1497 and T1497.001)**: These techniques are used to detect and avoid virtual environments and sandboxes. This aligns with the question's mention of tricks to evade detection and emulation.
- **Discovery (T1497)**: After evading detection, the malware is expected to gather information about the victim's computer. This includes operating system details and installed security products, which is a form of discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Evasion**: Grandoreiro uses techniques like API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation. This is consistent with the T1497 and T1497.001 techniques.
2. **Information Gathering**: After successfully evading detection, the malware proceeds to gather information about the victim's computer. This is a form of discovery, which is consistent with the T1497 technique.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that Grandoreiro will indeed collect information about the victim's computer after evading detection.

### Final Answer: A
