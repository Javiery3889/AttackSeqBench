Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a specific domain and IP address combination is configured for C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. It then asks if Longhorn's malware is likely to communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves exfiltrating data at scheduled times, which aligns with the question's mention of "scheduled exfiltration."
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 (Command and Control) channel for exfiltration, which aligns with the C&C communication described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described scenario. The malware is configured for C&C communication, and it is likely to use scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described scenario. If the malware is configured for C&C communication and scheduled exfiltration, it is unlikely that it would not use these methods.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware is configured for C&C communication and scheduled exfiltration.
- The related TTPs, T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, support the idea that the malware is likely to use these methods.
- Answer Choice A (Yes) is the most plausible because it aligns with the described scenario and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
