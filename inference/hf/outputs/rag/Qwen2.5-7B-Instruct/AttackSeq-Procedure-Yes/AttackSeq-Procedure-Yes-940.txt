Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker:
1. Distributing Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails to gain initial access.
2. Using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.
3. Employing COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions gaining initial access through spearphishing emails, which is a common method for initial compromise.
- **Stage-1 Downloader**: The question suggests using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader. This is a common technique to evade detection and to download more sophisticated malware.
- **Persistence**: The question mentions using COM object hijacking for persistence. The related TTPs confirm that this is a technique used for persistence, which aligns with the question.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails are a common method for gaining initial access.
2. **Stage-1 Downloader**: This is a plausible step to download and execute a new downloader, which is a common technique to evade detection and to download more sophisticated malware.
3. **Persistence**: COM object hijacking is a technique used for persistence, which aligns with the question.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
