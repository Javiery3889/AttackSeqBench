Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Regin, a known malware.
   - It mentions the use of C&C capabilities with specific modules (C375h and 1Bh) for managing communications and compromised systems.
   - The question then asks if Regin is likely to use its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files as part of its Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves discovering remote systems, which is not directly related to the question about file and directory discovery.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on a system, which is directly relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically asks about Regin's behavior in the Collection phase, where it gathers operational intelligence.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1083-File and Directory Discovery, are directly relevant to the question.
   - Regin, known for its sophisticated capabilities, would likely use file and directory discovery to gather information, including deleted files, as part of its Collection phase.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Regin is known for its advanced capabilities in gathering intelligence.
   - The question mentions the use of C&C capabilities, which are part of the initial compromise and control phase.
   - The Collection phase involves gathering operational intelligence, which would include discovering files and directories, including deleted files.
   - The related TTP T1083-File and Directory Discovery aligns with the question's focus on file discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
