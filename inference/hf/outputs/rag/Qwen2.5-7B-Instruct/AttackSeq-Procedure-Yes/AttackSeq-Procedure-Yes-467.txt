### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants, which provide full control over the victim systems and the capability to wipe files, under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code. This aligns with the exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 in the malicious Word document.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a malicious link via email to gain initial access. While not directly mentioned in the question, it is related to the spear phishing aspect.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email to gain initial access. This directly aligns with the question's description of a malicious Word document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involve gaining initial access through spear phishing and exploiting a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
   - The Bankshot implants, as described, provide full control over the victim systems and the capability to wipe files, which aligns with the tactic of Resource Development.
   - Hidden Cobra is known for developing sophisticated malware and implants to maintain long-term access and control over targeted systems, which includes the capability to wipe files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the attack sequence and the capabilities of Hidden Cobra, it is highly likely that they would develop such implants to maintain control and perform destructive actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the development of the Bankshot implants for full control and file wiping.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
