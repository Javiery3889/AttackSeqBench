Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attackers persist in the network by configuring applications to run batch files every hour.
2. They then use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.
3. Finally, they upload these credentials to an external FTP server they control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
  - **Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves collecting credentials from password stores.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance**
  - **Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials through various means.
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
  - **Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves storing credentials in files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. The attackers persist by configuring applications to run batch files every hour, then use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores, and finally upload these credentials to an external FTP server they control.
  - The related TTPs (T1555, T1589.001, and T1552.001) support the use of legitimate applications to collect credentials and the subsequent uploading of these credentials to an external server.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence described in the question. It would imply that the attackers do not use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores and upload them to an external FTP server, which contradicts the attack sequence provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the attackers persist by configuring applications to run batch files, then use legitimate applications to collect credentials, and finally upload these credentials to an external FTP server.
- The related TTPs support the use of legitimate applications to collect credentials and the subsequent uploading of these credentials to an external server.
- Answer Choice A aligns perfectly with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
