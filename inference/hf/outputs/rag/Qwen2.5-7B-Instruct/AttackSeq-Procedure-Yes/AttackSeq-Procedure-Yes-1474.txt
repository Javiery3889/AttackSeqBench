### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a SLUB backdoor collects specific types of information (screenshots, file listings, and user Desktop folder archives).
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to communicate with attackers using the Slack API to post messages and command results to a private Slack channel for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves the use of chat messages for credential access. While this is related to communication, it does not directly address the use of Slack API for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves bidirectional communication for command and control. This is more relevant to the question as it pertains to the communication aspect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the question's scenario where the malware is communicating with attackers using the Slack API for command and control.
     - The related TTPs, particularly T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, support the idea of bidirectional communication for command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the scenario described in the question and does not align with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
