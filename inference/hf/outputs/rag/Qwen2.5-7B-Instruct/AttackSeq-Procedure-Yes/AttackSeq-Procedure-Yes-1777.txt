Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sayad malware:
1. Discovery: Collecting system and application details.
2. Next step: Capturing screenshots.
3. Final step: Exfiltrating the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the collection phase of the attack:
- **Tactic: Collection**
  - **Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data for later use.
  - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine if capturing screenshots (T1113-Screen Capture) is a likely next step after collecting system and application details (T1560-Archive Collected Data).

- **Technique T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique is about archiving the collected data, which is a preparatory step for exfiltration.
- **Technique T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing visual information from the screen, which could provide additional context or evidence of the malware's activities.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Discovery Phase**: The malware has already collected system and application details.
2. **Next Step**: The question asks if the malware is likely to proceed with capturing screenshots.
3. **Context of TTPs**: While T1560 focuses on archiving data, T1113 focuses on capturing visual information. Capturing screenshots can provide additional insights into the environment and activities of the target system, which could be valuable for the attacker.
4. **Likelihood**: Given that the malware is already collecting detailed information, it is plausible that it would also capture visual evidence to support its data collection efforts.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
