Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initial access via a fake app.
2. Execution of a malware downloader.
3. Installation and execution of a RAT named 'IvizTech' as a service to maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the techniques used:
- **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves using legitimate names or locations to evade detection.
- **T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique involves installing malware as a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing malicious files to gain control or persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1543.003-Windows Service)**: This TTP is about maintaining persistence, which aligns with the final step of installing and executing 'IvizTech' as a service.
- **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File)**: This TTP is about executing malicious files, which aligns with the step of executing the malware downloader.
- **Defense Evasion (T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location)**: This TTP is about evading detection, which could be part of the overall strategy but is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs in the question.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The malware gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app.
2. **Execution**: The malware downloader is executed, which is a step in the execution phase.
3. **Persistence**: The malware installs and executes 'IvizTech' as a service, which is a step in the persistence phase.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and aligns with the provided TTPs. The malware first executes a downloader, then installs and executes 'IvizTech' as a service to maintain persistence.

Final Answer: A
