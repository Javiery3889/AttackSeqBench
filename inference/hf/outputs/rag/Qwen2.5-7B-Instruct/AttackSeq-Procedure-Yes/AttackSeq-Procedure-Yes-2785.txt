Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Data collection from iOS devices (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location information).
2. Exfiltration of this data via HTTP requests.
3. Communication with a C&C server.
4. Use of a Base64 encoded token for identification.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves the use of standard encoding methods to obfuscate data or commands.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a channel that is also used for command and control communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence:
    1. Data collection (as described in the question).
    2. Exfiltration via HTTP requests (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
    3. Communication with a C&C server (Tactic: Command and Control).
    4. Use of a Base64 encoded token for identification (T1132.001-Standard Encoding).

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence, as it would imply that the data is not exfiltrated via HTTP requests or that the communication does not use a C&C channel with a Base64 encoded token.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is collected from iOS devices and then exfiltrated via HTTP requests to a C&C server. The use of a Base64 encoded token for identification is a common technique to obfuscate the communication, which aligns with the related TTPs.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of standard encoding (Base64) for C2 communication, which supports the use of a Base64 encoded token for identification.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
