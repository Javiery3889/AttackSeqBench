Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information before initiating command and control communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's system, which aligns with the question's mention of surveying the victim's computer to gather details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography, which is relevant to the encryption method (AES in CBC mode) mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the sequence of actions before command and control communication. The related TTPs indicate that gathering system information (T1082) is a common tactic in the early stages of an attack, followed by the use of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) for secure communication.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (surveying the victim's computer to gather details, then using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode for command and control) aligns with the typical attack sequence where reconnaissance (gathering information) precedes the establishment of a secure communication channel.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The OceanLotus backdoor is likely to perform reconnaissance (gathering system information) before establishing a secure communication channel.
   - The use of AES in CBC mode for encryption is a common method for secure communication, which aligns with the TTPs provided.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to first gather system information and then use symmetric cryptography for secure communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
