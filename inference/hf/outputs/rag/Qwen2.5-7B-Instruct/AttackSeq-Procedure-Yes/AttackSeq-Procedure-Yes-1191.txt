Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Adding a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows registry Run key to launch the RMS executable during user logon.
2. Using this persistence mechanism to evade detection during reconnaissance and lateral movement.
3. The RMS executable attempting to connect to a C2 server located in Germany.
4. TA505 utilizing the ServHelper backdoor during the Command and Control phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to evade detection. This aligns with the first part of the question where the 'Microtik' string value is added to the Windows registry Run key.
- **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves using registry run keys or startup folders to ensure persistence. This aligns with the second part of the question where the RMS executable is launched during user logon.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring the malware runs at boot or logon. This also aligns with the second part of the question.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the RMS executable will attempt to connect to a C2 server located in Germany and if TA505 will utilize the ServHelper backdoor during the Command and Control phase.
- The related TTPs do not directly address the C2 server location or the ServHelper backdoor. However, the persistence and evasion techniques described in the question are consistent with the TTPs provided.
- TA505 is known to use various techniques for persistence and evasion, and the ServHelper backdoor is one of their known tools. Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that TA505 could use the ServHelper backdoor for C2 communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
