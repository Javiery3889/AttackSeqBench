Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the execution of T9000 malware via an RTF file exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - It then mentions a multi-stage shellcode process and sideloading a malicious DLL, `hccutils.dll`, through a legitimate executable, `igfxtray.exe`.
   - The sequence continues with setting registry keys and injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe` for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves loading a DLL into the AppInit DLL search order, which is a common method for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate executable, which is a method to bypass security measures and achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence that includes sideloading a malicious DLL (`hccutils.dll`) through a legitimate executable (`igfxtray.exe`), which aligns with the T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading technique.
   - The sequence also mentions setting registry keys and injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe`, which aligns with the T1546.010-AppInit DLLs technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sideloading of `hccutils.dll` through `igfxtray.exe` is a plausible initial step to gain persistence.
   - Setting registry keys and injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe` is another common method for persistence.
   - Both techniques are relevant and plausible in the context of the described attack sequence.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the described sequence and the related TTPs, the answer is that T9000 is likely to use these methods for persistence.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A: Yes"
