Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Passive monitoring of HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns.
2. Exfiltration of specific data (configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates).
3. Capability to download additional components from a C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. This aligns with the monitoring of HTTP GET and POST requests.
  - **Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves impersonating a protocol or service to establish a C2 channel. This could be relevant for the capability to download additional components from a C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that FoggyWeb is likely to perform all the actions described in the question.
  - **Passive Monitoring**: T1071.001-Web Protocols supports this.
  - **Exfiltration**: The question does not specify a technique for exfiltration, but it is a common action in C2 scenarios.
  - **Downloading Additional Components**: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation supports this.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that FoggyWeb is unlikely to perform all the actions described in the question.
  - There is no direct contradiction in the related TTPs that would make this choice plausible.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The related TTPs support the actions described in the question.
- T1071.001-Web Protocols supports passive monitoring of HTTP requests.
- T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation supports the capability to download additional components from a C2 server.
- Exfiltration of data is a common action in C2 scenarios and is not contradicted by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: Yes
