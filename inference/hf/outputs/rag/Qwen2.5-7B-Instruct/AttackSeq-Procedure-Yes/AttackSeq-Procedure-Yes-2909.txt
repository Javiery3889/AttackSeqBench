Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malicious code is executed using the AtomBombing technique. The question then asks if it is likely that threat actors will use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique involves using asynchronous procedure calls to perform actions that would otherwise require higher privileges. However, this technique is not directly related to the question's focus on process injection and code injection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a legitimate process to hide malicious activity or gain additional privileges. This is directly relevant to the question as it involves injecting code into trusted processes to evade security products.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the question's scenario. After exploiting AtomBombing to execute malicious code, it is plausible that threat actors would use process injection to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the question's scenario. There is no logical reason to believe that threat actors would not use process injection to achieve the described objectives.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where malicious code is executed using AtomBombing.
- The goal is to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1055-Process Injection, directly support the idea of injecting code into trusted processes to achieve these goals.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that threat actors would use this capability to inject code into trusted processes.

**Final Answer: A**
