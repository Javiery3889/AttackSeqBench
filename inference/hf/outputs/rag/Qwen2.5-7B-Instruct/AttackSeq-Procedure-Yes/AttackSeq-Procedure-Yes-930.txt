Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Credential Access (using keylogging to gain admin passwords)
2. Lateral Movement (using writable mass storage devices, specifically USBs)
3. Command and Control (using a multi-tiered server backend framework)

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware or exfiltrate data.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique is about how the malware initially gains access to the system, which can be through removable media.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control, which can be a multi-tiered server backend framework.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question does not explicitly mention initial access, but the use of writable mass storage devices (USBs) for Lateral Movement can be seen as a form of initial access.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question states that the Explosive Trojan will use writable mass storage devices for Lateral Movement, which aligns with the TTP T1091-Replication Through Removable Media.
- **Command and Control**: The question mentions a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control, which aligns with the TTP T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question (Credential Access -> Lateral Movement -> Command and Control) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
- The use of writable mass storage devices (USBs) for Lateral Movement is a common technique (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media).
- The multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control is also a common technique (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).

Given the alignment of the described sequence with the related TTPs, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
