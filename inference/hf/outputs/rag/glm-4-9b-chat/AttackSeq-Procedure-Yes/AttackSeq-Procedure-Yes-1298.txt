Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that a campaign that has exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction and is about to steal stored passwords and access tokens would employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion

T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution refers to the exploitation of client-side software vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the target system. CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability that allows silent code execution without user interaction, which aligns with T1203.

T1070.004-File Deletion is a technique used for defense evasion, which involves deleting files to avoid detection or to disrupt the security tools' ability to analyze the system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs in the question is as follows:
1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution)
2. Stealing stored passwords and access tokens (not specified, but likely related to TTPs such as T1083-Access Token Duplication or T1087-Command and Scripting Interpreter)
3. Employing T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion

Given that the campaign has already executed arbitrary code on the client-side, the next logical step would be to establish persistence or to gather information that would allow for further access or control of the system. Stealing passwords and access tokens is a common step in this process. After this, the campaign would likely attempt to evade detection, which is where T1070.004-File Deletion comes into play.

The TTP T1070.004-File Deletion is a technique that could be used to delete files that might contain evidence of the attack or that could be used by security tools to analyze the system. This makes it a plausible step in the sequence, as it aligns with the goal of defense evasion.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The campaign has already executed arbitrary code on the client-side using CVE-2017-11882 (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
2. The next step in the sequence is likely to steal stored passwords and access tokens, which is not specified but could involve T1083-Access Token Duplication or T1087-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
3. After gathering information, the campaign would need to evade detection, which is where T1070.004-File Deletion fits in as a plausible technique for defense evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
