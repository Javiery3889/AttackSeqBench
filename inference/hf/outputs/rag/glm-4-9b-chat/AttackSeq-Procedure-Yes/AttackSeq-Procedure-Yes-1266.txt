Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the attack sequence described by the name "Blind Eagle" includes specific steps: 
- A JavaScript downloader that uses ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
- PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs for initial access.
- A VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat for persistence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

T1059.001 refers to the use of PowerShell, which is a scripting language and command-line shell that can be used to automate tasks and execute commands. This technique is often used in attacks for its stealthy nature and the ability to bypass certain security measures.

T1059.005 refers to the use of Visual Basic, which can be used to create scripts that can be executed on a system. This technique is also used for automation and can be used to create persistence mechanisms.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the attack sequence described in the question:

A: Yes
- The use of PowerShell (T1059.001) is consistent with the use of PowerShell commands.
- The use of a VBScript (T1059.005) is consistent with the use of a VBScript in the Startup folder.
- However, the question mentions a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject, which is not directly related to the TTPs provided. ActiveXObject is a Microsoft technology that allows access to COM objects from JavaScript, but it is not listed as a TTP.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the described attack sequence does not involve the use of a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject, PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs, or a VBScript in the Startup folder.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided are consistent with the use of PowerShell and VBScript, which are mentioned in the attack sequence.
- However, the TTPs do not include the use of a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject, which is a key component of the described attack sequence.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question does not align with the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
