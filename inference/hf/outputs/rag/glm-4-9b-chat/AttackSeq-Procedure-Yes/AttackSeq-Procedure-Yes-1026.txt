Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Gamaredon's malware, after performing specific actions (inserting malicious macros into documents, using a backdoor to list files), will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery

T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive is a technique that involves collecting data from network shared drives. This technique is directly related to the collection of data, which is the current tactic mentioned in the question.

T1083-File and Directory Discovery is a technique used for discovering files and directories on a system. This technique is related to the discovery phase, which is also mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question's scenario involves a sequence of actions that include inserting malicious macros and using a backdoor for file discovery. The next logical step in the attack lifecycle, after discovery, is typically collection. Given that the related TTPs include a technique for collecting data from network shared drives (T1039), it is plausible that the malware would continue to the next phase of the attack lifecycle, which is data collection.

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Given the context of the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would continue to the next phase of the attack lifecycle, which is data collection. Therefore, it is likely that the malware would scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that include discovery and collection.
- The related TTPs include a technique for collecting data from network shared drives (T1039), which is relevant to the collection phase.
- The technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery is also relevant to the discovery phase, which has already been mentioned in the question.
- Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the malware would continue to the next phase of the attack lifecycle, which is data collection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
