Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Naikon APT group used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during its discovery phase, followed by using HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server. The question implies that the group has already evaded defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows and utilizing fileless loading techniques.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by attackers to evade detection by operating through legitimate web traffic.

T1572-Protocol Tunneling is a technique where an attacker uses a protocol to encapsulate and transmit arbitrary data. This can be used to bypass network security measures that are designed to detect certain types of traffic.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question:

A: Yes
- The Naikon APT group is known for evading defenses and using fileless loading techniques, which suggests they are sophisticated and likely to use advanced tools like the Aria-body backdoor.
- The Aria-body backdoor is a known tool used by the Naikon group, and it is plausible that it could be used to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase.
- The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for communication with the C&C server is consistent with the TTPs provided, as T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1572-Protocol Tunneling are both relevant.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the Naikon APT group did not use the Aria-body backdoor for gathering information about active processes, which contradicts the known behavior of the group and the capabilities of the Aria-body backdoor.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the following reasoning can be provided:

1. The Naikon APT group is known for sophisticated tactics, including the use of fileless loading and evading defenses.
2. The Aria-body backdoor is a known tool used by the group, and it is plausible that it could be used for gathering information about active processes.
3. The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for communication with the C&C server is consistent with the TTPs provided.
4. The answer choice "No" does not align with the known behavior of the Naikon APT group or the capabilities of the Aria-body backdoor.

Final Answer: A: Yes
