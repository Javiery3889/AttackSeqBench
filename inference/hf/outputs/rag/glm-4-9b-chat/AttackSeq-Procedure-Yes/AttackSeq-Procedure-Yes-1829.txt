Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the callCam app, after evading detection through overlay screens during the installation of the payload app, is likely to perform specific actions: collect files and screenshots, encrypt this data using RSA and AES, and then exfiltrate it to a Command and Control (C&C) server.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

These TTPs suggest that the attacker is engaging in data collection, evading detection, and using encryption and obfuscation techniques.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs indicate that the attacker is collecting data (T1560), which could include files and screenshots. The use of encryption (T1027.013) and obfuscation (T1027) are also mentioned, which could be used to encrypt the collected data before exfiltration. This answer choice aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the callCam app does not perform the described actions. However, the TTPs suggest that the app does engage in data collection, encryption, and possibly obfuscation, which would support the "Yes" answer.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that the attacker is engaging in data collection (Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data), which includes collecting files and screenshots.
- The TTPs also suggest that the attacker is using encryption (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File) and obfuscation (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information), which could be used to encrypt the collected data before exfiltration.
- Based on the alignment of the TTPs with the actions described in the question, it is plausible that the callCam app would collect files and screenshots, encrypt this data using RSA and AES, and then exfiltrate it to the C&C server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
