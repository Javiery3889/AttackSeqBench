Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a phishing email is used to deliver a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro. The question then asks if it is likely that the VBA macro will execute commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL before establishing persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

T1059.005 refers to the technique of using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code. This is relevant because the question mentions a VBA macro being used in a PowerPoint add-in document.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The VBA macro is a common method for delivering malicious payloads, as mentioned by T1059.005. It is plausible that the VBA macro could be designed to execute 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. This is a common method for attackers to bypass security measures and establish persistence on a system.
- Creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours is also a plausible persistence mechanism. This would allow the attacker to maintain access to the system over time.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the VBA macro would not execute 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper, nor would it create a scheduled task for persistence. However, given the context and the TTPs provided, this seems less likely.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The VBA macro is a known technique for delivering malicious payloads, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper is a plausible method for attackers to bypass security measures and establish persistence.
- The creation of a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours is a common persistence mechanism used by attackers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
