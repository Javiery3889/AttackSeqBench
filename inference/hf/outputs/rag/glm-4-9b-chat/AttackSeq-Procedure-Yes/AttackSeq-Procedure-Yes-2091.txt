Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after the initial discovery and mapping of the internal network using Cobalt Strike beacon and collecting administrative-level credentials, the attackers are likely to move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools laterally across the network to maintain persistence and move to other systems.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the attackers have already gained initial access using domain accounts (T1078.002). This is a common method for attackers to move laterally within a network. The subsequent TTP, T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, indicates that the attackers are likely to transfer tools across the network to maintain their presence and move to other systems. This aligns with the idea that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the attackers will not move laterally. However, the TTPs provided indicate that lateral movement is a likely next step in the attack, as the attackers have already gained initial access and have the capability to transfer tools laterally.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already gained initial access using domain accounts, which is a common method for initial access.
- The TTPs suggest that the attackers will transfer tools laterally across the network, which is indicative of lateral movement.
- The combination of these TTPs supports the idea that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
