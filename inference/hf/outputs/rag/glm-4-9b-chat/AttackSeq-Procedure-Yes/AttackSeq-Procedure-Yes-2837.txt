Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control (C2) operations after discovering system information and process lists using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery

T1071.001-Web Protocols is a technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework that refers to the use of web protocols for command and control. This technique is often used by malware for its communication with the C2 server.

T1057-Process Discovery is a technique within the Discovery tactic that involves gathering information about the processes running on a system. The use of 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' is an example of this technique.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware is likely to use HTTPS communication for C2 operations. Since T1071.001-Web Protocols involves using web protocols, which include HTTPS, this answer is plausible.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware is unlikely to use HTTPS communication for C2 operations. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no information that contradicts the use of web protocols for C2, so this answer is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware's discovery phase, which is followed by the potential use of HTTPS communication for C2 operations.
- The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using web protocols for C2, which includes HTTPS.
- There is no information provided that contradicts the use of HTTPS for C2 operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
