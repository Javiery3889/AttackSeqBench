Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after the discovery phase where attackers gather information about systems, users, and data, they are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement
- Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

The Tactic "Lateral Movement" refers to the actions taken by an attacker to move laterally within a network after initial access has been gained. The Technique "T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services" is a specific method within the Lateral Movement Tactic that involves exploiting remote services to move from one system to another.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
This answer suggests that after the discovery phase, the attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points. This aligns with the Tactic of Lateral Movement and the Technique of Exploitation of Remote Services.

B: No
This answer suggests that the attackers will not exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points. This contradicts the Tactic of Lateral Movement, as lateral movement is a common step in many attack sequences to expand their presence within the network.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Step 1: The question is about the sequence of actions taken by attackers after the discovery phase.
Step 2: The related TTPs indicate that lateral movement is a tactic used by attackers, and exploiting remote services is a technique within that tactic.
Step 3: The Tactic of Lateral Movement is a logical next step after gathering information in the discovery phase, as it allows attackers to move around the network and establish a more significant presence.
Step 4: The Technique of Exploiting Remote Services is a specific method of lateral movement, which supports the idea that attackers would use this technique to move laterally.

Final Answer: A: Yes
