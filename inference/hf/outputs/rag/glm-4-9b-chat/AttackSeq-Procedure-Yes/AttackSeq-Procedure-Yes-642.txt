Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Moafee and DragonOK, after using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access, are likely to use custom-built backdoors and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) during resource development. It also asks if they will use environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks to execute their payloads.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This indicates that the initial method of attack is through spear-phishing emails.
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware: This suggests that the attackers are likely to develop resources, such as malware, as part of their attack process.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- Spear-phishing is a common initial access vector, which is consistent with the TTP provided.
- The use of custom-built backdoors and RATs is a plausible step in resource development, as these are tools that can be used to maintain persistence on a compromised system.
- The use of environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks is a plausible method to avoid detection, which aligns with the TTP for malware development.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that Moafee and DragonOK do not use custom-built backdoors and RATs or environment-based evasion techniques after gaining initial access, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access method of spear-phishing is consistent with the TTP provided.
- The TTP for resource development suggests that the attackers are likely to develop malware, which could include custom-built backdoors and RATs.
- The TTP for malware development also implies the use of evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to avoid detection.

Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
