Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether after FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access, it is likely that they will use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for persistence. The question also mentions that they might use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for persistence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence
- Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

T1505.003-Web Shell is a technique that involves deploying web shells on compromised servers for persistence. T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is a technique that involves using multiple stages of communication channels to communicate with the command and control server, which is relevant to the Command and Control tactic.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that after deploying web shells and custom malware, FIN13 will use BLUEAGAVE for persistence. BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that listens on high ephemeral ports for incoming HTTP requests and command execution. This aligns with the TTPs provided, as T1505.003-Web Shell is a technique for persistence, and BLUEAGAVE is a method that can be used for persistence.

B: No
- This answer suggests that FIN13 will not use BLUEAGAVE for persistence after deploying web shells and custom malware. However, the related TTPs indicate that persistence is a tactic, and T1505.003-Web Shell is a technique for achieving persistence. Since BLUEAGAVE is a method that can be used for persistence, it is plausible that FIN13 could use it.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where FIN13 has already achieved initial access using web shells and custom malware.
- Persistence is a tactic that is often used after initial access to maintain a presence on the compromised system.
- The related TTPs include T1505.003-Web Shell, which is a technique for persistence, and T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which is relevant to command and control.
- BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that can be used for persistence, which aligns with the TTPs provided.

Final Answer: A: Yes
