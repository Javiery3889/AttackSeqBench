Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether SparrowDoor, a malware used for Execution, is likely to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted HTTPS channel after it has been executed on a system that has been compromised through the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- Tactic: Command and Control - This tactic is related to the communication aspect of the attack, which is the focus of the question.
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols - This technique suggests that the attackers might use web protocols for command and control communication, which includes HTTPS.
- Tactic: Initial Access - This tactic is related to how the attackers gained access to the system, which is the initial step in the sequence described in the question.
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application - This technique indicates that the attackers exploited a public-facing application, which is the means by which they gained initial access.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that SparrowDoor will use an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control communication. Given that T1071.001-Web Protocols is a technique associated with command and control, and HTTPS is a web protocol, this answer choice is plausible.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that SparrowDoor will not use an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control communication. However, there is no information provided that contradicts the use of web protocols for command and control, so this answer choice is less plausible without further context.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with Initial Access through the exploitation of a public-facing application (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and continues with Execution using SparrowDoor.
- The related TTPs indicate that web protocols (including HTTPS) are used for command and control (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
- Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that SparrowDoor, as a piece of malware designed for command and control, would use an encrypted HTTPS channel for communication with its C&C server.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with Answer Choice A: Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
