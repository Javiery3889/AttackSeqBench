Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the data collected by Yellow Garuda from victims' Telegram accounts using a 'grabber' tool would be exfiltrated over the web and stored in a SQLite database and JSON format. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the exfiltration of data over a command and control (C2) channel. This technique is often used by attackers to send stolen data back to their command and control server.

T1213-Data from Information Repositories is a technique where an attacker collects data from information repositories, which could include social media accounts like Telegram.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- The TTP T1041 suggests that the data could be exfiltrated over a C2 channel, which implies that the data could be sent over the web. However, the TTP does not specify the format in which the data is stored or exfiltrated.
- The TTP T1213 indicates that the attacker collects data from information repositories, which includes social media accounts. This supports the idea that the attacker would collect data from Telegram accounts.

B: No
- The TTP T1041 suggests that the data could be exfiltrated over a C2 channel, which implies that the data could be sent over the web. However, the TTP does not specify the format in which the data is stored or exfiltrated.
- The TTP T1213 indicates that the attacker collects data from information repositories, which includes social media accounts. This supports the idea that the attacker would collect data from Telegram accounts.

The key point here is that while the TTPs suggest that the data could be exfiltrated over the web, they do not explicitly state the format in which the data is stored. However, the question specifically asks about the format being SQLite and JSON. Without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that the data is stored in these formats.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs suggest that the data could be exfiltrated over the web, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- The TTPs do not provide explicit information about the storage format of the data.
- The question asks about the likelihood of the data being stored in SQLite and JSON format, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No

The answer is "No" because the provided TTPs do not support the claim that the data is stored in SQLite and JSON format. The TTPs only suggest that the data could be exfiltrated over the web, not the specific storage format.
