Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that after using T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to evade defenses, the threat actors would use T1057 Process Discovery to gain knowledge about the systems and internal networks, followed by leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS

The TTPs indicate that the actors are interested in command and control activities and have used subverted trust controls to evade defenses. The TTPs also suggest that they might use application layer protocols or DNS for command and control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that after using T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, the actors would use T1057 Process Discovery to gather information about the systems and networks, and then use T1071 Application Layer Protocol for command and control.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the actors would not use T1057 Process Discovery after T1553 Subvert Trust Controls and would not use T1071 Application Layer Protocol for command and control.

Given the sequence of TTPs, T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls) is a technique used to bypass security measures, which is followed by T1057 (Process Discovery) to gather information about the systems and networks. This information gathering is a logical step before establishing command and control. T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is a technique used for command and control, which fits the sequence after gathering information.

The related TTPs also indicate that the actors are interested in command and control, which aligns with the use of T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The actors have used T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls) to evade defenses.
2. After bypassing defenses, it is plausible that they would gather information about the systems and networks.
3. T1057 (Process Discovery) is a technique used for gathering such information.
4. With the information gathered, the actors would likely establish command and control.
5. T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is a technique used for command and control, which fits the sequence after information gathering.

Final Answer: A: Yes
