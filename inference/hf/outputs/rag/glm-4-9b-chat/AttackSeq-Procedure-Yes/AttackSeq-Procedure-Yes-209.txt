Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether FamousSparrow, a malware that uses SparrowDoor for communication, is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

T1041 refers to exfiltrating data over a Command and Control (C2) channel, which is the channel used by SparrowDoor. T1048.002 refers to exfiltrating data over an asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocol, which is not directly related to the C2 channel used by SparrowDoor.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor. Since T1041 explicitly mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel, this answer aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer suggests that FamousSparrow is not likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor. However, the related TTPs do not provide any information that contradicts the use of the C2 channel for exfiltration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about exfiltration over the C&C channel, which is the primary function of the C2 channel.
- The related TTPs indicate that exfiltration over the C2 channel is a known technique (T1041).
- There is no information provided that contradicts the use of the C2 channel for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
