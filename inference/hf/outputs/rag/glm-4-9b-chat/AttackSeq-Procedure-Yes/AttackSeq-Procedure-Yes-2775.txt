Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Dragonfly group, after using self-deleting code for defense evasion, is likely to have focused on Windows systems to gather system information as part of the discovery tactic, and then used the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally among systems.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing indicators of the attacker's presence to avoid detection.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol: This technique refers to the use of RDP to move laterally within a network.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests a typical cyber attack lifecycle, starting with defense evasion and moving to discovery and lateral movement. Here's how the related TTPs fit into this sequence:

- Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal): This is consistent with the first part of the question, where the Dragonfly group is using self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence.
- Discovery (gathering system information on Windows systems): This is a plausible step after defense evasion, as attackers often gather information about the environment to understand their position and plan their next moves.
- Lateral Movement (using RDP): This is consistent with the second part of the question, where the group is likely to use RDP to move laterally among systems.

Given that the Dragonfly group is known for targeting critical infrastructure and using sophisticated methods, it is reasonable to assume they would follow a structured attack pattern that includes discovery and lateral movement after defense evasion.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Dragonfly group is known for using self-deleting code, which is a technique associated with defense evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal).
2. After defense evasion, it is common for attackers to gather information about the target environment, which aligns with the discovery tactic.
3. The use of Windows systems for gathering system information is a plausible step, as Windows is a common target for such activities.
4. The use of RDP for lateral movement is a well-documented technique (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol) that is often used by attackers to move within a network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
