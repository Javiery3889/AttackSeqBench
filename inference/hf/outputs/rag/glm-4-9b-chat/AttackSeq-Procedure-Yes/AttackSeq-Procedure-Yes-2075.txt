Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether RIG EK (RIG Exploit Kit) is likely to deliver exploits through malvertising, which involves redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites, followed by running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising: This technique involves using malvertising to deliver malicious content.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique refers to the use of PowerShell for executing scripts, which can be used to run obfuscated scripts.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a user's system without any action on their part, which can be a result of visiting a compromised website.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- RIG EK is known for delivering exploits through malvertising (T1583.008-Malvertising), which matches the first part of the question.
- The use of PowerShell (T1059.001-PowerShell) to run an obfuscated script is a common method for delivering malware, which aligns with the second part of the question.
- The Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise is relevant because it describes the initial compromise that could lead to the delivery of the exploit through malvertising.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that RIG EK does not use malvertising or PowerShell for delivering exploits, which contradicts the known behavior of RIG EK.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- RIG EK is known to use malvertising (T1583.008-Malvertising) to deliver exploits, which is consistent with the first part of the question.
- The use of PowerShell (T1059.001-PowerShell) to run an obfuscated script is a common method for delivering malware, which is consistent with the second part of the question.
- The Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise is relevant because it describes the initial compromise that could lead to the delivery of the exploit through malvertising.

Final Answer: A: Yes
