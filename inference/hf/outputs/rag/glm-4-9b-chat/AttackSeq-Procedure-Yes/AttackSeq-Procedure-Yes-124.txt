Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication and actions, the threat actor (Agrius) would deploy wipers like 'Apostle' that later turned into functioning ransomware to destroy data on targeted systems.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction: This indicates that the attack's goal is to cause harm or disruption by destroying data.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion: This suggests that the attackers are attempting to evade detection by deleting files that could be used to identify their presence or actions.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The use of 'IPsec Helper' for communication and actions is consistent with the need for stealthy communication channels, which aligns with the Defense Evasion Tactic (T1070.004-File Deletion). The deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' that later turned into ransomware to destroy data aligns with the Impact Tactic (T1485-Data Destruction). This sequence of actions is plausible given the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' is not a likely outcome after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. However, the TTPs provided suggest that the attackers are indeed interested in causing data destruction, which would be a plausible outcome after establishing a stealthy communication channel.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of 'IPsec Helper' indicates a need for stealthy communication, which is consistent with the Defense Evasion Technique (T1070.004-File Deletion).
- The deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' for data destruction aligns with the Impact Tactic (T1485-Data Destruction).
- Given the TTPs provided, the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
