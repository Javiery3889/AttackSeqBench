Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Shuckworm, a threat actor, is likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions after executing malicious VBS scripts and deploying a custom backdoor. The question also mentions that the actor will employ HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
  - Technique: T1218.005-Mshta (This technique involves using mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions)
- Tactic: Execution
  - Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic (This technique involves executing Visual Basic scripts, which is relevant to the VBS scripts mentioned in the question)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is asking about the sequence of actions Shuckworm is likely to take. The TTPs provided suggest that the actor has already executed malicious VBS scripts (T1059.005-Visual Basic) and deployed a custom backdoor. The next step in the sequence is to bypass application control solutions, which is where T1218.005-Mshta comes into play.

The sequence of actions in the question is:
1. Execute malicious VBS scripts
2. Deploy custom backdoor
3. Use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions
4. Employ HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading

Given that the TTPs provided are T1059.005 and T1218.005, it is clear that the actor has already executed the VBS scripts and is now looking to bypass application control solutions. The use of mshta.exe (T1218.005) is a plausible step in this sequence, as it is a technique specifically designed for defense evasion, which aligns with the tactic mentioned in the question.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer suggests that Shuckworm is likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions after deploying the backdoor.

Answer Choice B: No - This answer suggests that Shuckworm is not likely to use mshta.exe for this purpose.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Step 1: The actor has executed malicious VBS scripts (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
Step 2: The actor has deployed a custom backdoor.
Step 3: The actor needs to bypass application control solutions.
Step 4: The TTP T1218.005-Mshta is a technique for defense evasion that involves using mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions.
Step 5: The sequence of actions in the question matches the TTPs provided, with mshta.exe being used as a method to bypass application control solutions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
