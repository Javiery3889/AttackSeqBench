Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after gathering detailed system information using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries, a backdoor is likely to collect a wide range of additional data from the victim's system. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

The Tactic "Discovery" refers to the process of gathering information about the target environment. The Technique "T1082-System Information Discovery" is a specific method within the Discovery Tactic that involves using system information tools to gather details about the system, such as the hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the backdoor will indeed collect a wide range of data from the victim's system after gathering initial system information. This is plausible because after discovering system information, an attacker would likely want to understand the full scope of the system's capabilities and vulnerabilities to better exploit it.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the backdoor will not collect additional data. However, this seems less plausible given the nature of a backdoor. A backdoor is designed to provide persistent access to a system, and collecting a wide range of data is a common practice for attackers to maintain control and understand the environment better.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial TTP (T1082-System Information Discovery) indicates that the attacker has already gathered detailed system information.
- The nature of a backdoor is to provide persistent access and control over the system, which typically requires a comprehensive understanding of the system's environment.
- Collecting a wide range of data, such as file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information, is consistent with the goals of a backdoor.

Final Answer: A: Yes
