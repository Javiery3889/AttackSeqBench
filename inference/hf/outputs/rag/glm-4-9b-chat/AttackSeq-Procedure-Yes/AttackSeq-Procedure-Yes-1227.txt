Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether The Inception attackers, after conducting a reconnaissance spear phishing attack, are likely to exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities. The question is essentially asking if the sequence of actions described is plausible based on the provided TTPs.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution

T1203 refers to the exploitation of client-side software vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the target system. CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows for remote code execution. This technique is a common method used in the Execution tactic, which involves executing malicious code on the target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER. This aligns with the T1203 technique, which is a method of exploitation for client execution. Given that CVE-2017-11882 is a client-side vulnerability, this sequence is plausible.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the attackers will not exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor. However, since T1203 is a technique for exploiting client-side vulnerabilities, and CVE-2017-11882 is such a vulnerability, this sequence is a plausible attack vector.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that begins with reconnaissance spear phishing, which is a common initial step in spear-phishing attacks.
- The attackers are then likely to exploit a client-side vulnerability, which is what CVE-2017-11882 represents.
- The technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution is directly related to the exploitation of such vulnerabilities.
- The use of remote templates in Microsoft Word is a method that can be used to exploit CVE-2017-11882.
- The deployment of the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities is a plausible next step after exploitation.

Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
