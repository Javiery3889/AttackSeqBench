Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether SideCopy, a malware that maintains persistence on a system, is likely to use specific tactics to evade detection. The two tactics mentioned are mimicking legitimate processes (T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location) and using decoy documents (T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service).

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are focused on defense evasion. T1036.005 involves matching legitimate names or locations to avoid detection, while T1036.004 involves masquerading as a task or service to evade detection. Both of these techniques are designed to make the malicious process appear legitimate or non-malicious.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given that the question is about the likelihood of SideCopy employing tactics to evade detection, we need to evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that SideCopy is likely to use the mentioned defense evasion tactics. Since both T1036.005 and T1036.004 are defense evasion techniques, this answer aligns with the context of the question.

B: No - This answer suggests that SideCopy is not likely to use the mentioned defense evasion tactics. However, given the nature of malware that maintains persistence, it is common for such malware to use defense evasion techniques to avoid detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the likelihood of SideCopy using defense evasion tactics.
- The related TTPs are T1036.005 and T1036.004, both of which are defense evasion techniques.
- Malware that maintains persistence often uses defense evasion to avoid detection.
- Therefore, it is plausible that SideCopy would use these defense evasion tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
