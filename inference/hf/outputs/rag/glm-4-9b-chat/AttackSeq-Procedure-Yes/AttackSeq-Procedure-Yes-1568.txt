Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Turla, a known cyber espionage actor, is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase of an attack. The question specifies that the file upload and download capabilities were implemented with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include recent files.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is part of the discovery phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that Turla is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase. This aligns with the TTPs T1025 and T1005, which are both related to the collection phase and involve collecting data from the local system and removable media, respectively.

B: No
- This answer suggests that Turla is not likely to use its backdoor plugins for collecting recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase. However, the provided TTPs do not support this conclusion, as they are all related to the collection phase and involve collecting data from the local system and removable media.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the file upload and download capabilities were implemented during the discovery phase, which is a precursor to the collection phase.
- The related TTPs indicate that Turla is known to collect data from the local system and removable media, which are relevant to the collection phase.
- The TTPs do not suggest any reason why Turla would not use its backdoor plugins for collecting data during the collection phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
