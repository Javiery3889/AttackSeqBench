Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Shuckworm, a cyber espionage actor, is likely to download additional payloads after communicating with their Command and Control (C&C) servers using HTTP requests. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

T1071.001 is a technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework that refers to the use of web protocols for command and control. This technique is often used by attackers to communicate with their C&C servers, which is consistent with the scenario described in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads after establishing communication with their C&C servers using HTTP requests. This is plausible because cyber espionage actors often use multiple payloads to maintain persistence and expand their presence within a network.

B: No
- This answer suggests that Shuckworm is not likely to download additional payloads. This is less plausible given the nature of cyber espionage campaigns, which often require multiple tools and payloads to achieve their objectives.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence involving communication with C&C servers using HTTP requests, which is a common technique for command and control activities.
- The related TTPs indicate that web protocols are used for command and control, which aligns with the scenario described.
- Cyber espionage campaigns typically involve the use of multiple payloads to maintain control and achieve various objectives within a compromised network.
- Based on the above reasoning, it is more plausible that Shuckworm would download additional payloads after establishing communication with their C&C servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
