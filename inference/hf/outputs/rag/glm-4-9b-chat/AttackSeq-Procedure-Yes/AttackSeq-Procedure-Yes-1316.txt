Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker, CosmicDuke, is likely to use after using document-based exploits. The sequence includes:
- Deceiving victims into opening malicious PDF files.
- Executing malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
- Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
- Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging

T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a victim's system. This technique is relevant to the last part of the question, which involves exfiltration via FTP and WebDav.

T1056.001-Keylogging is a technique used for collecting information by logging keystrokes. This technique is relevant to the part of the question that mentions collecting information through keylogging.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the sequence described in the question:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to use keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing as part of the attack sequence, followed by exfiltration and updating via FTP and WebDav. The related TTPs (T1020 and T1056.001) support this sequence, as they involve exfiltration and collection, respectively.

B: No
- This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to use the described sequence of TTPs. However, the related TTPs indicate that exfiltration (T1020) and collection (T1056.001) are plausible actions for an attacker in this scenario.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that an attacker is likely to take after deploying a malicious payload.
- The related TTPs provide support for the exfiltration (T1020) and collection (T1056.001) aspects of the attack.
- Given that the TTPs are relevant to the actions described in the question, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use these techniques in the sequence mentioned.

Final Answer: A: Yes
