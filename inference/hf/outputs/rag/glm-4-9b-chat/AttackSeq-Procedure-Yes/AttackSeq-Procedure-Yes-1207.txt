Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after the discovery phase where system information is gathered using PyFlash backdoor, it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with a hardcoded C&C server and use AES-128 in CBC mode for encryption on specific ports for command and control operations.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- Tactic: Discovery - This indicates that the initial phase of the attack involves gathering information about the target system.
- Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery - This technique is used to gather information about the network configuration of the system, which aligns with the system information gathering mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Command and Control - This tactic is about establishing communication with a command and control server.
- Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography - This technique involves using symmetric encryption, which is a common method for securing C&C communications.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- The question describes the discovery phase, which is consistent with the T1016 technique. 
- The use of a hardcoded C&C server is a common method for command and control operations, aligning with the Tactic: Command and Control.
- Utilizing AES-128 in CBC mode for encryption is a plausible method for securing the communication, as indicated by the T1573.001 technique.
- Therefore, the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible given the related TTPs.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the sequence of actions described in the question is not likely, which contradicts the plausible alignment with the related TTPs.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The discovery phase is consistent with T1016, which involves gathering system information.
- The use of a hardcoded C&C server is a common practice for command and control, aligning with the Tactic: Command and Control.
- The use of AES-128 in CBC mode is a plausible encryption method for securing C&C communications, as indicated by T1573.001.
- Therefore, the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible based on the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
