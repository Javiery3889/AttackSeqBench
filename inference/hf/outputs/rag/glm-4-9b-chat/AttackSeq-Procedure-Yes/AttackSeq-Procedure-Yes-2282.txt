Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Regin, a sophisticated malware, is likely to perform certain actions after discovering information on processes and memory utilization. Specifically, it inquires if Regin would crawl through the file system and gather computer information for the purpose of collection before encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection

T1005-Data from Local System refers to the technique of gathering data from the local system, which could include scanning for deleted files and monitoring network traffic. T1119-Automated Collection suggests the use of automated methods to collect data, which could be part of the process of gathering information from the local system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that Regin would indeed crawl through the file system and gather computer information for the purpose of collection before encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.
- The TTPs provided indicate that Regin is engaged in collection activities, which aligns with the first part of the answer choice. However, the TTPs do not explicitly mention the use of cookies for exfiltration or the crawling of the file system for this purpose.

B: No
- This answer suggests that Regin would not crawl through the file system and gather computer information for the purpose of collection before encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.
- The TTPs provided do not mention the use of cookies for exfiltration, and while they do indicate collection activities, they do not specify the method of collection or the use of cookies.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided focus on the collection of data from the local system and automated collection, which are relevant to the initial discovery of information on processes and memory utilization.
- However, the TTPs do not provide explicit evidence that Regin would use cookies for exfiltration or crawl through the file system for this purpose.
- Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to definitively conclude that Regin would perform these specific actions.

Final Answer: B: No
