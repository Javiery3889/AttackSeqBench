Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that attackers will execute Remote Access Trojans (RATs) entirely in memory to avoid disk interaction and evade antivirus detection. The sequence of events described includes the delivery of the RAT payload via email attachments or by tricking users into downloading files, and the attackers have not yet created persistence mechanisms by pointing to specific registry keys.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.010-Regsvr32: This technique involves using the Regsvr32 command to load a DLL into memory, which can be used to execute code without writing to disk.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique refers to the execution of a malicious file, which could be a RAT payload.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage: This technique involves storing data or code in memory to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the attackers are using techniques that align with executing code in memory (T1027.011-Fileless Storage) and evading detection (T1218.010-Regsvr32). This supports the idea that the attackers are likely to execute the RAT entirely in memory.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the attackers are not using the techniques mentioned to execute the RAT in memory, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers are trying to evade detection by executing the RAT in memory.
- The TTPs provided include techniques that are directly related to executing code in memory (T1027.011-Fileless Storage) and evading detection (T1218.010-Regsvr32).
- Given that the TTPs align with the described attack sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that the attackers are likely to execute the RAT entirely in memory.

Final Answer: A: Yes
