Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the attackers' infrastructure is likely to receive the stolen data from compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control (C2) phase. The context is an attack that involves mobile applications loaded with spyware collecting sensitive information.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

T1071-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control communication. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique for exfiltrating data automatically, which could be part of the exfiltration phase. T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of non-application layer protocols for command and control communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that fits the description of using an application layer protocol for command and control. This suggests that the attackers might use an application layer protocol to receive the stolen data.

B: No
- T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol suggests that the attackers might use a non-application layer protocol for command and control. This would imply that the data is not received over an application layer protocol.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attackers are using mobile applications loaded with spyware to collect sensitive information. This is a part of the Collection phase.
- The question then asks about the Command and Control phase, which is the phase where the attackers would typically receive the stolen data.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that aligns with the use of an application layer protocol for command and control, which is a plausible method for receiving data from compromised devices.
- T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is also a plausible method, but it does not directly address the use of an application layer protocol as specified in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's context is the use of an application layer protocol for command and control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
