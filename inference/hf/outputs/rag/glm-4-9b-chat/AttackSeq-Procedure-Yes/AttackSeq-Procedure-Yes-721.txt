Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Rising Sun implant, after ensuring persistence by placing a second-stage binary in the startup folder, will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control communication.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery: This technique is used to discover the internet connection details of the system.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery: This technique is used to discover system owner/user information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question focuses on the implant's discovery activities before communicating with control servers. The related TTPs suggest that the implant is likely to perform discovery activities. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities. This is plausible because the TTPs provided include techniques for system owner/user discovery (T1033), which aligns with the potential need to gather such information.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not fetch computer name and user name information. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no information that contradicts the idea that the implant would perform discovery activities, including system owner/user discovery.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the implant's discovery activities, and the related TTPs include techniques that are relevant to discovery (T1016 and T1033).
- The TTPs do not provide any information that would suggest the implant would skip discovery activities.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the implant would perform discovery activities, including fetching computer name and user name information, before communicating with control servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
