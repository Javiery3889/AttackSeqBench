Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have used specific Defense Evasion techniques (T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls) before employing Discovery techniques (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry). The context here is the SolarWinds attack, which is known to be sophisticated and aimed at evading detection.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls

T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location is a technique that involves using legitimate names or locations to avoid detection. T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is a technique that aims to bypass or manipulate security controls to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence on a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The SolarWinds attack is well-documented and known for its complexity and the attackers' ability to remain undetected for an extended period. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would have used Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection.

- T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location: This technique is useful for attackers to make their malicious processes or files appear as legitimate ones, which could help them avoid detection by security tools that rely on file names or locations.
- T1553-Subvert Trust Controls: This technique is used to bypass or manipulate security controls, which could be part of the attackers' strategy to maintain persistence and avoid being detected by security systems.

The question specifically mentions T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry as Discovery activities. These are techniques used to gather information about the system, which is a logical step after evading detection. It is plausible that the attackers would have used T1036 and T1553 before T1057 and T1012 to ensure they could operate without being detected.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The SolarWinds attack is known for its sophisticated nature and the attackers' ability to remain undetected.
2. T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location and T1553-Subvert Trust Controls are Defense Evasion techniques that would be used to avoid detection.
3. T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry are Discovery techniques that would be used after the attackers have evaded detection.
4. Given the context of the SolarWinds attack and the nature of the TTPs provided, it is likely that the attackers would have used T1036 and T1553 before T1057 and T1012.

Final Answer: A: Yes
