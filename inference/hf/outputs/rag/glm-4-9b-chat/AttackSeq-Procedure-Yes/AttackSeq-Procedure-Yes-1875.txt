Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether FIN13, after using specific tools and techniques (ProcDump for memory dumping and BLUEAGAVE for command execution), is likely to exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory

The TTPs suggest that the attacker is interested in maintaining persistence on the system (T1505.003-Web Shell) and accessing credentials (T1003.001-LSASS Memory). The LSASS memory dump technique is often used to extract credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), which is a common method for credential access.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The use of ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and BLUEAGAVE for command execution indicates that the attacker is interested in obtaining credentials. However, the TTPs provided do not explicitly mention the exploitation of external servers or the deployment of web shells for initial access. The TTPs are more focused on persistence and credential access.

B: No
- The absence of TTPs related to external server exploitation and web shell deployment suggests that the sequence of actions described does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that FIN13 would exploit external servers and deploy web shells for initial access. The TTPs provided are more aligned with lateral movement and credential access rather than initial access.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the sequence of TTPs leads to the conclusion that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells for initial access. The provided TTPs are focused on persistence and credential access, not on the initial access phase.
- The use of ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE is indicative of post-compromise activities rather than initial access methods.
- There is no mention of external server exploitation or web shell deployment in the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
