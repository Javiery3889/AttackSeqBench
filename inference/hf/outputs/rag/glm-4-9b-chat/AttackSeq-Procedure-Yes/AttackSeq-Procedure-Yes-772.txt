Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether recipients of spear phishing emails containing RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery are likely to be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before they get infected with QuasarRAT.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution refers to the exploitation of client-side software vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the target system. CVE-2017-8750 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is a technique where the attacker uses a link in an email to direct the user to a malicious website, which could potentially deliver malware.

T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is a technique where the attacker uses an attachment in an email to deliver malware to the target.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This suggests that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before they get infected with QuasarRAT.

B: No - This suggests that the recipients will not be presented with such a document before getting infected.

The TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves spear phishing emails with attachments (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) and the exploitation of a client-side vulnerability (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution). The spear phishing emails are designed to deceive the recipient into opening the attachment, which contains the exploit for CVE-2017-8750. The exploit would then execute the QuasarRAT on the target system.

The TTPs do not explicitly mention a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report. However, it is common for spear phishing attacks to use social engineering techniques to make the email appear more legitimate and increase the likelihood of the target opening the attachment.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The TTPs provided indicate that the attack uses spear phishing emails with attachments to deliver the exploit for CVE-2017-8750.
2. Spear phishing attacks often use social engineering techniques, such as simulating legitimate documents, to increase the likelihood of the target opening the malicious attachment.
3. There is no explicit mention of a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report in the TTPs, but it is a common practice in spear phishing attacks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
