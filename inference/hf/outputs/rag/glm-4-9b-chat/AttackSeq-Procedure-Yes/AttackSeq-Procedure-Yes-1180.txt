Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether a backdoor, which has been used to collect machine information and take screenshots during the Discovery and Collection tactics, will likely communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is a technique that involves using multiple stages of communication channels to communicate with a C&C server. This technique is often used to evade detection and to make it harder for security analysts to trace the communication back to the C&C server. T1113-Screen Capture is a technique used to collect screenshots, which is relevant to the Discovery and Collection tactics mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase. Since T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is a technique used for communication with a C&C server, it is plausible that the backdoor would use an encrypted channel to communicate with the C&C server to maintain stealth and evade detection.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the backdoor will not communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel. However, given the use of T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, it is unlikely that the attacker would not use encryption to communicate with the C&C server, as encryption is a common method to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that a backdoor has been used to collect information and take screenshots, which are part of the Discovery and Collection tactics.
- The related TTPs include T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which is a technique used for communication with a C&C server, often involving encrypted channels.
- Given the use of T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, it is reasonable to assume that the backdoor would use an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server during the Command and Control phase to maintain stealth and evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
