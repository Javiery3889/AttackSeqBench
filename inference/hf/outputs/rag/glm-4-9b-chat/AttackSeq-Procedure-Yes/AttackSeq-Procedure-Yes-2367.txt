Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely for a malware system, after executing commands from an encrypted file to infect removable media and collect system files, to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence by deleting key artifacts.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery

T1070-Indicator Removal is a technique used by adversaries to remove, disable, or cover up artifacts that could be used to detect or trace an attack. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to avoid detection and persistence.

T1083-File and Directory Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the file system. This could include recursive directory listings to find files and directories that are relevant to the attacker's objectives.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question, we can evaluate the answer choices based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes - This suggests that the malware system would perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence.
B: No - This suggests that the malware system would not perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence.

The TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to remove indicators of its presence (T1070-Indicator Removal) and discover files and directories (T1083-File and Directory Discovery). It is plausible that the malware would perform both actions in a sequence that makes sense for its objectives. The malware might first discover files and directories to understand the environment and then remove any evidence of its presence to avoid detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already executed commands from an encrypted file to infect removable media and collect system files.
2. The TTP T1070-Indicator Removal suggests that the malware is likely to clean up after itself to avoid detection.
3. The TTP T1083-File and Directory Discovery suggests that the malware is likely to gather information about the file system.
4. It is plausible that the malware would first gather information (T1083) and then clean up (T1070) to maintain stealth.

Final Answer: A: Yes
