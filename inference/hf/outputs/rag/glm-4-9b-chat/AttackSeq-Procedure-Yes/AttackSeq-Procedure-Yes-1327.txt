Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether CosmicDuke, a known malware, is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer during the Collection phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This technique refers to the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a victim's system to a remote server. It could involve scripts, scheduled tasks, or other automated processes.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial collection phase mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique refers to exfiltrating data over non-command and control (C2) protocols that are not encrypted, which could be a method used by CosmicDuke.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - CosmicDuke is known to exfiltrate data, and the related TTPs suggest that it could use automated methods (T1020) and potentially non-encrypted protocols (T1048.003). However, the question specifically mentions FTP, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. While it's plausible that CosmicDuke could use FTP, we cannot confirm this without additional information.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to use FTP for exfiltration. The related TTPs do not explicitly mention FTP, but they do suggest automated exfiltration methods, which could include other protocols or methods.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use FTP for exfiltration, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. While it is plausible that CosmicDuke could use automated exfiltration methods, the absence of FTP in the related TTPs and the lack of specific information about CosmicDuke's use of FTP makes it difficult to definitively conclude that it will use FTP.
- Given the information provided, the most cautious answer would be to consider the possibility but not assume it as a certainty.

Final Answer: B: No
