Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests after gathering specific information from the registry. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. T1012-Query Registry is a technique used for discovery, which involves retrieving information from the registry. T1568-Dynamic Resolution is a command and control technique that involves resolving domain names dynamically.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question describes an attack sequence that starts with reconnaissance (T1012-Query Registry) and then proceeds to command and control (C2) communication. Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the implant is capable of command and control activities (T1071.001 and T1568-Dynamic Resolution). Since the question mentions HTTP POST requests, which are a common method for C2 communication, this answer choice is plausible.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the implant does not communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests. However, the TTPs provided indicate that the implant is designed for command and control activities, which typically involve some form of communication with a C2 server. Without additional information that contradicts this, it is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence that includes gathering information from the registry (T1012-Query Registry) and then communicating with control servers (command and control activities).
- The TTPs provided suggest that the implant is designed for command and control, which would involve communication with a C2 server.
- The use of HTTP POST requests is a common method for such communication, as indicated by the TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols.
- Based on the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the implant communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Final Answer: A: Yes
