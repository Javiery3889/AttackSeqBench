Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Derusbi malware, after beaconing system information to a command and control (C2) infrastructure via destination port 443, is likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

T1071.001 refers to the use of web protocols for command and control. This technique is often used by malware to communicate with its C2 server, which can include HTTP, HTTPS, or other web protocols.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the information provided:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware is likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.
- Given that T1071.001 involves the use of web protocols for command and control, it is plausible that the malware could use HTTP for beaconing. However, the specific endpoint /photos/photo.asp is not mentioned in the TTPs provided, and the use of obfuscated communication is not explicitly stated.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware is not likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.
- While the TTPs do not explicitly mention the use of obfuscated communication or the specific endpoint /photos/photo.asp, they do indicate the use of web protocols for command and control. Therefore, it is not a definitive "no," but rather a possibility that the malware might use HTTP for beaconing.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that the malware uses web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of HTTP for beaconing.
- However, the specific endpoint /photos/photo.asp and the use of obfuscated communication are not explicitly mentioned in the TTPs.
- Given that the TTPs do not provide enough information to confirm the use of obfuscated communication or the specific endpoint, the most plausible answer is that the malware could use HTTP for beaconing but without the additional details provided, we cannot confirm the use of obfuscated communication or the specific endpoint.

Final Answer: B: No
