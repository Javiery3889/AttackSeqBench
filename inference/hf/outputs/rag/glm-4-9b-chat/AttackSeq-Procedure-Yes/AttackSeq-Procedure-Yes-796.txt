Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform a series of actions after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. The actions include creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link: This technique involves using malicious links to deliver payloads.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification: This technique is used to maintain persistence on an infected system by modifying shortcuts.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript: This technique involves executing JavaScript to perform malicious actions.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the Higaisa APT group uses malicious links (T1204.001) to deliver payloads, which could include a JavaScript file. The execution of JavaScript (T1059.007) is also a technique they might use. The persistence technique (T1547.009) could be used to ensure the malware remains active after the initial infection. The sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the Higaisa APT group does not use the TTPs mentioned to perform the described actions. However, the TTPs provided suggest that they do use these techniques, which would make this answer choice less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that align with the TTPs provided, indicating that the Higaisa APT group is likely to use these techniques.
- The TTPs include the use of malicious links to deliver payloads, which could be a JavaScript file, and the execution of JavaScript to perform actions.
- Persistence is also a key aspect of the attack, which is achieved through shortcut modification.
- The final action of sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL is consistent with the use of malicious links and the execution of JavaScript.

Final Answer: A: Yes
