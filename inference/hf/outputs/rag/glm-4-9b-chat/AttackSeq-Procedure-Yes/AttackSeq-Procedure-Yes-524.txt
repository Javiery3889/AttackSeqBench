Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the INOCNATION malware, which has employed XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation for defense evasion, is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control communications.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of common web protocols for command and control communications. This technique is often used by malware to communicate with its command and control (C2) server in a way that is less likely to be detected by security systems.

T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography refers to the use of public-key cryptography, which is often used to encrypt communications between the malware and its C2 server. This technique provides a secure way to exchange keys and encrypt data.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation are techniques used to evade detection. Using encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections is a common method for evading detection as well, as it can make network traffic harder to inspect and analyze. Asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) could be used to secure the communication channel, which is consistent with the use of SSL/TLS. Therefore, this answer choice is plausible.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the malware is not likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections. However, given the context of the TTPs provided, there is no information that contradicts the use of encrypted communications. The techniques mentioned are all methods that could be used to enhance the malware's ability to communicate securely and evade detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a malware that has already employed several defense evasion techniques, which suggests that it is designed to avoid detection and secure its communications.
- The TTPs provided indicate that using encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and asymmetric cryptography are common practices in malware operations.
- There is no information in the TTPs that suggests the malware would not use these techniques.

Final Answer: A: Yes
