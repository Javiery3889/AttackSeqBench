Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether "Machete" malware, after establishing persistence on a target machine, is likely to perform specific malicious activities: logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1123-Audio Capture
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging

The TTPs indicate that the malware is capable of collecting information (Tactic: Collection) and specifically mentions keylogging (T1056.001) and audio capture (T1123). The third TTP suggests credential access, which is a separate tactic but also involves keylogging.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question asks if the malware is likely to perform the following actions after establishing persistence:
1. Log keystrokes
2. Capture audio from the computer's microphone
3. Hijack the clipboard

Given the related TTPs:
- The first and third TTPs directly support the first action (keylogging).
- The second TTP supports the second action (audio capture).

The third action (hijacking the clipboard) is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, since the malware has already established persistence, it is plausible that it could perform additional actions to collect information, including hijacking the clipboard.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has established persistence, which is a common precursor to further malicious activities.
2. The TTPs indicate the malware is capable of keylogging and audio capture, which are consistent with the first two actions mentioned in the question.
3. Although the TTPs do not explicitly mention clipboard hijacking, the general tactic of "Collection" suggests that the malware is designed to gather information, which could include clipboard data.
4. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware is likely to perform the actions described in the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
