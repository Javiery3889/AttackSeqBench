Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after a successful privilege escalation using the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll`, the shellcode will contact its Command and Control (C&C) server at the specified URL and resolve the domain to the given IP address for further malicious activity.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver

The TTPs indicate that the attacker has already escalated privileges (T1055) and is now attempting to establish a Command and Control connection (T1102). The dead drop resolver technique (T1102.001) is a method used to resolve domain names to IP addresses without using standard DNS resolution, which is often used to avoid detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the shellcode will contact the C&C server and resolve the domain as described. Given the TTPs, this is plausible because the attacker has already escalated privileges and is now attempting to establish a C&C connection, which could involve resolving a domain to an IP address.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the shellcode will not contact the C&C server or resolve the domain as described. This is less plausible given the TTPs, as the attacker is actively trying to establish a C&C connection, which would typically involve resolving a domain to an IP address.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has successfully escalated privileges using a Metasploit module, which is a common step in a cyber attack.
- The attacker is now attempting to establish a C&C connection, which is a typical next step in an attack lifecycle.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the attacker is using a dead drop resolver, which is a method to resolve domain names to IP addresses without using standard DNS resolution, which is consistent with the action of resolving a domain to an IP address.
- Based on the context of the question and the provided TTPs, it is plausible that the shellcode will contact the C&C server and resolve the domain as described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
