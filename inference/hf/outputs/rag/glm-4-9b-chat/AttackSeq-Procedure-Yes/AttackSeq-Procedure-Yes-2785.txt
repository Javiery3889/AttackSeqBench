Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that a malicious XAgent app, after collecting sensitive data from iOS devices, will exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests using a Base64 encoded token for identification. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control (C2)
- Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding
- Tactic: Exfiltration
- Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1132.001-Standard Encoding refers to the use of standard encoding methods to obfuscate data, which is often used in C2 communications to evade detection. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that data exfiltration is done through the command and control channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the malicious app could use standard encoding (T1132.001) to encode the data before exfiltrating it. This is consistent with the use of Base64 encoding, which is a standard encoding method.
- The TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that exfiltration is done through the C2 channel, which aligns with the idea that the data would be exfiltrated via HTTP requests to the C&C server.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the malicious app does not use standard encoding (T1132.001) or the C2 channel (T1041) for exfiltration, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided suggest that the malicious app would use standard encoding (T1132.001) to encode the data and exfiltrate it over the C2 channel (T1041), which is consistent with the use of Base64 encoding and HTTP requests.
- The use of Base64 encoding is a standard method that fits the TTP T1132.001, and exfiltrating data via HTTP requests aligns with T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
