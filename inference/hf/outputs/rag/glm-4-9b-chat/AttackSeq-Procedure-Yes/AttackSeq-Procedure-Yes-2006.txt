Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on a network through employee-enabled macro execution. The question is specifically about the likelihood of communication establishment post-installation.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
  - Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
  - Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery

These TTPs are related to the reconnaissance phase of an attack, where an attacker gathers information about the target system and its network connections. T1018 involves discovering remote systems, while T1049 involves discovering system network connections.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is about the communication phase after the implant is installed, not the reconnaissance phase. The TTPs provided are reconnaissance techniques, which are not directly related to the communication phase. However, we can infer that if an implant like BlackEnergy 3 is installed on the network, it would likely attempt to communicate with its C2 servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Given this context, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely that the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed. This is plausible because many malware implants are designed to communicate with their C2 servers to maintain persistence and receive commands.

B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely that the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed. This is less plausible because the primary purpose of most malware is to communicate with its C2 servers for various malicious activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the communication phase after the implant is installed.
- The provided TTPs are related to the reconnaissance phase, which is not directly relevant to the communication phase.
- Given the nature of malware implants, it is common for them to establish communication with their C2 servers after installation.

Final Answer: A: Yes
