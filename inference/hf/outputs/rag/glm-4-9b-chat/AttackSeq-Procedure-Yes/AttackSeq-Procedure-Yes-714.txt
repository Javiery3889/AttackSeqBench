Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Rising Sun implant, after the Sharpshooter downloader has been injected into the memory of Word through a malicious macro, is likely to download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which could be the Sharpshooter downloader in this context.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic: This technique suggests the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code, which is often associated with malicious macros in documents like Microsoft Word.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question, we need to determine if the Rising Sun implant is likely to download a second-stage payload after the Sharpshooter downloader has been executed. The TTPs provided indicate that the initial access is achieved through the execution of a malicious file (T1204.002) and the use of a malicious macro (T1059.005).

The Rising Sun implant is a known malware that is designed to perform various malicious activities, including downloading additional payloads. The sequence of TTPs provided suggests that the initial access is achieved by executing a malicious file (the Sharpshooter downloader) through a malicious macro. This aligns with the typical behavior of malware that uses a downloader to deliver a second-stage payload.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload after the Sharpshooter downloader has been executed.

Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload after the Sharpshooter downloader has been executed.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be one where the implant performs the expected behavior of a downloader, which is to download a second-stage payload. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
