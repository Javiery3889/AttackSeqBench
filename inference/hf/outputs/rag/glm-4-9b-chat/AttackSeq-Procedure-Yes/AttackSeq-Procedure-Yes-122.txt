Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker, likely Agrius, has gained initial access to a target system by exploiting a public-facing application (CVE-2018-13379). The question then asks if Agrius is likely to use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic, leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement, and communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This indicates that the initial access was gained by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol: This suggests that the attacker is using RDP for lateral movement within the network.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- Exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) aligns with the initial access method described in the question.
- Using webshells for tunneling RDP traffic is a plausible method for maintaining persistence and evading detection, as it can be used to hide RDP traffic within legitimate web traffic.
- Leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement is a common technique used by attackers to move laterally within a network.
- Communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP is a sophisticated method that can bypass traditional network defenses.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that none of the described actions are likely to be used by Agrius. However, based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it seems that these actions are plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access method (T1190) is consistent with the scenario described.
- The use of webshells for tunneling RDP traffic is a plausible technique for evading detection and maintaining persistence.
- Lateral movement using compromised accounts is a common and effective method for attackers to move within a network.
- Communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP is a sophisticated method that can be used to avoid detection.

Given the plausibility of each step in the sequence of TTPs, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
