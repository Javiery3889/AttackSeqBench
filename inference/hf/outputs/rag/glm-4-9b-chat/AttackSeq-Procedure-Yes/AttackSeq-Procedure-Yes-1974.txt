Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that threat actors who have used phishing emails to infiltrate a client's supply chain and are targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are all related to the Tactic: Reconnaissance. The Techniques listed are:
- T1591-Gather Victim Org Information: This technique involves collecting information about the target organization, which could include employee details, network infrastructure, and other relevant information.
- T1589.002-Email Addresses: This technique involves collecting email addresses, which can be used for further phishing campaigns or to understand the communication patterns within the target organization.
- T1591.002-Business Relationships: This technique involves gathering information about the business relationships of the target organization, which can be useful for understanding the supply chain and potential entry points.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that it is likely that the threat actors will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts. This is plausible because the TTPs provided are all related to gathering information about the target organization, which is a common step in reconnaissance.

B: No
- This answer suggests that it is not likely that the threat actors will gather victim organization information. However, given the TTPs provided, this seems less plausible because the techniques listed are all directly related to gathering information about the target organization.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the threat actors have already used phishing emails to infiltrate the client's supply chain and are targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks. This indicates a sophisticated and targeted attack, which typically involves thorough reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs are all techniques that are commonly used to gather information about a target organization, which is a critical step in reconnaissance.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the threat actors would gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
