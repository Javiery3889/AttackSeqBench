Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely for the Korplug variant, after collecting data, to communicate with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by malware to blend in with legitimate web traffic, which could include using HTTPS for initial handshakes.

T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of non-standard protocols for command and control communication. This technique is used to avoid detection by security systems that monitor standard protocols.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The use of web protocols (T1071.001) suggests that HTTPS could be used for the initial handshake, which is a common practice to obfuscate malicious traffic.
- The use of a custom TCP-based protocol (T1095) implies that the malware might use a non-standard TCP connection for subsequent communication, which is consistent with the description in the question.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that Korplug does not use a custom TCP-based protocol for communication with C&C servers, which contradicts the TTP T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.
- The TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols supports the use of HTTPS for the initial handshake.
- The TTP T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol supports the use of a custom TCP-based protocol for subsequent communication.
- Based on the provided TTPs, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
