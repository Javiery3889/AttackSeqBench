Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that Elfin, a threat actor, would exploit CVE-2018-20250 by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails before deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution. The question is essentially asking if the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) described is plausible.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution is a technique that involves exploiting a vulnerability on the client side to execute code. CVE-2018-20250 is a known vulnerability that could be exploited in this manner.

Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link refers to the use of spear-phishing emails to deliver a malicious link that leads to initial access to the target's system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs in the question can be broken down as follows:
1. Scanning for vulnerable websites (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but a common initial step in many attacks).
2. Identifying targets or creating C&C infrastructure (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but could be part of the broader attack campaign).
3. Exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
4. Deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).

Given the related TTPs, the sequence described in the question is plausible. The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing, which is a common method for initial access. The exploitation of CVE-2018-20250 is a client-side exploitation technique, which aligns with T1203. The deployment of malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution is a typical step in the execution phase of an attack.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is achieved through a spear-phishing email, which is a plausible method for gaining access to a target's system.
2. The exploitation of CVE-2018-20250 is a client-side exploitation technique that can be delivered via a spear-phishing email, as mentioned in the related TTPs.
3. The deployment of malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill follows the exploitation phase, which is consistent with the TTPs provided.

Final Answer: A: Yes
