Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the XAgent app, after executing itself in the background on iOS 7 devices while hiding its icon and restarting when terminated, is likely to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its Command and Control (C&C) server.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique where an attacker exfiltrates data to a Command and Control server. This is relevant because the question mentions sending data to a C&C server via HTTP.

T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique where an attacker gathers information about the system on which the malware is running. This is also relevant because the question mentions a discovery routine.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTP T1082-System Information Discovery suggests that the malware is likely to gather information about the system. Geo-location data is a type of system information, so it is plausible that the XAgent app could collect this data as part of its discovery routine.
- The TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that the malware is designed to send data to a C&C server. Since the question states that the data is sent out via HTTP to a C&C server, this TTP is consistent with the action of sending the collected data.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the XAgent app does not collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine. However, the TTP T1082-System Information Discovery suggests that it does gather system information, which could include geo-location data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTP T1082-System Information Discovery indicates that the malware is designed to collect system information, which could include geo-location data.
- The TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the malware is designed to send data to a C&C server, which is consistent with the action of sending the collected data.
- Based on the provided TTPs, it is plausible that the XAgent app collects geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and sends it to its C&C server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
