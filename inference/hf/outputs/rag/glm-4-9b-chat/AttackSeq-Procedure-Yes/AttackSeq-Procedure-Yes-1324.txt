Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether CosmicDuke, a known threat actor, is likely to use specific TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a particular sequence: keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing, followed by exfiltrating data to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System

These TTPs suggest that the threat actor is engaged in the process of exfiltrating data and collecting information from the local system. The keylogging technique (T1056.001) is a method of collecting data, and the data from local system technique (T1005) is also a collection technique. The automated exfiltration technique (T1020) is a method of exfiltrating data.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger (T1056.001) to collect keystrokes.
- CosmicDuke is likely to use a screenshotter to collect visual information (not explicitly listed, but related to T1005).
- CosmicDuke is likely to use a clipboard stealer to collect clipboard data (not explicitly listed, but related to T1005).
- CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate the collected data to remote servers via FTP (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that CosmicDuke would not use the mentioned TTPs in the described sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- CosmicDuke is known for its data collection and exfiltration activities.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the threat actor is engaged in collecting data from the local system.
- The keylogging technique (T1056.001) is a common method for collecting data, which aligns with the question's sequence.
- The data from local system technique (T1005) is broad and could include screenshotting and clipboard stealing, which are also mentioned in the question.
- The automated exfiltration technique (T1020) is a method of exfiltrating data, which is the final step mentioned in the question.

Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use the mentioned TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
