Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the RMS (Remote Management System) tool, which was used for reconnaissance and lateral movement within the victim network, attempted to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server located in Germany using application layer protocols.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

T1071 refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control communication. T1071.001 specifically mentions the use of web protocols, which are a subset of application layer protocols. T1095 refers to the use of non-application layer protocols, which are typically lower-level protocols like TCP or UDP.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question, we know that the RMS tool was used for reconnaissance and lateral movement. The question is whether it is likely that the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 server using application layer protocols.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  This answer suggests that the RMS executable did attempt to communicate with a C2 server using application layer protocols. This is plausible because T1071 and T1071.001 are techniques that involve using application layer protocols for command and control.

- Answer Choice B: No
  This answer suggests that the RMS executable did not attempt to communicate with a C2 server using application layer protocols. This is less plausible given the TTPs provided, as T1071 and T1071.001 are techniques that involve using application layer protocols.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Step 1: The question is about the communication method used by the RMS tool for command and control.
Step 2: The related TTPs indicate that application layer protocols are used for command and control.
Step 3: Answer Choice A aligns with the TTPs provided, suggesting that the RMS executable used application layer protocols for communication.
Step 4: Answer Choice B does not align with the TTPs provided, as it suggests a non-application layer protocol was used.

Final Answer: A: Yes
