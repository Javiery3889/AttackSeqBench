Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Sunburst backdoor, which was delivered through a supply-chain attack, will likely communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol for further exploitation. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

T1071.001-Web Protocols is a technique that involves using web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by attackers to avoid detection and to communicate with their C2 servers.

T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain is a technique where attackers compromise the software supply chain to deliver malicious software to the target. This is the technique used in the initial access phase of the attack, which is relevant to the Sunburst backdoor's delivery.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- The Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated malware that was delivered through a supply-chain attack. It is common for such malware to communicate with its C2 server using a protocol to maintain persistence and receive further instructions. T1071.001-Web Protocols is a technique that aligns with this behavior.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the Sunburst backdoor would not communicate with its C2 server using a protocol. However, given the context of the TTPs and the nature of sophisticated malware like Sunburst, it is unlikely that it would not use a protocol for command and control communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated piece of malware that was delivered through a supply-chain attack, which is a common initial access technique (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain).
- The backdoor is designed to maintain persistence and communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation. This is a characteristic of the Command and Control tactic (Tactic: Command and Control).
- The use of web protocols for command and control communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a common technique for evading detection and maintaining stealthy communication channels.
- Based on the context of the TTPs and the nature of the Sunburst backdoor, it is reasonable to conclude that it would use a protocol for further exploitation.

Final Answer: A: Yes
