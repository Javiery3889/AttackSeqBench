Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the malware known as Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate collected files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection

T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a victim's system. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that the exfiltration is done through a command and control (C2) channel. T1119-Automated Collection is the technique of automatically collecting data from a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- Infamous Chisel is known for its ability to exfiltrate data (T1020). The use of a Tor hidden service for exfiltration (T1041) is a plausible method for evading detection, as it provides anonymity. However, the question also mentions SSH connections, which is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. While it's possible that Infamous Chisel could use SSH for additional security or to bypass certain network defenses, the TTPs do not explicitly state this.

B: No
- The TTPs provided do not mention anything about SSH connections. While T1020 and T1041 suggest that Infamous Chisel is capable of automated exfiltration, the absence of SSH in the TTPs and the lack of a clear sequence that includes SSH connections make this answer less likely.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to use a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections for exfiltration. The TTPs provided do not include SSH connections, which are not a standard technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
- The TTPs do suggest that Infamous Chisel is capable of automated exfiltration (T1020) and could potentially use a Tor hidden service (T1041) for exfiltration, but the sequence involving SSH connections is not supported by the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
