Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the KerrDown DLL, after decoding and executing a base64 encoded blob, is likely to use process injection as a defense evasion tactic. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
  - Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
  - Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection

Tactic: Defense Evasion refers to a set of techniques used by adversaries to avoid detection and analysis by security systems. T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is a technique where an attacker deobfuscates or decodes files or information to avoid detection. T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library (DLL) Injection is a technique where an attacker injects a DLL into a running process to execute code.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically mentions that the KerrDown DLL is involved in decoding and executing a base64 encoded blob. This aligns with T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, as the DLL is deobfuscating the encoded payload.

The next part of the question asks if the DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection. This is a direct reference to T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection, which is a technique used to inject a DLL into a running process to execute code, often as a defense evasion tactic.

Given that both the decoding and the process injection are relevant TTPs, it is plausible that the KerrDown DLL would use both techniques as part of its attack.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the execution phase of the KerrDown DLL, which involves decoding a base64 encoded blob.
2. Decoding a base64 encoded blob is a technique that aligns with T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.
3. The question also mentions that the DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection.
4. Process injection is a technique that aligns with T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection.
5. Both TTPs are related to defense evasion, which is the overall tactic being discussed.
6. Since both TTPs are relevant to the question and are part of the defense evasion tactic, it is likely that the KerrDown DLL uses both techniques.

Final Answer: A: Yes
