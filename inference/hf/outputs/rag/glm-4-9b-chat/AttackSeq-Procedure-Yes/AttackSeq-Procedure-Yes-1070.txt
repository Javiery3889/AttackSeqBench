Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after implementing checks for security software during malware deployment to evade detection, it is likely that the attackers will perform specific actions (collecting system information and capturing screenshots) and then exfiltrate this information to a Mattermost server. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

The TTPs indicate that the attackers are engaging in activities that involve collecting data from the local system and capturing screenshots. T1005 refers to collecting data from the local system, which could include system information. T1113 refers to screen capture, which is directly related to capturing screenshots.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question, we can evaluate the answer choices based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that the attackers will indeed execute a series of commands to collect system information and capture screenshots before exfiltrating the information to the Mattermost server. The TTPs provided support this sequence of actions, as both T1005 and T1113 are techniques that align with the actions described in the question.

B: No - This answer suggests that the attackers will not execute the described actions. However, the TTPs provided indicate that the attackers are engaging in collection activities, which includes both data from the local system and screen capture. This does not align with this answer choice.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where attackers have evaded detection by implementing checks for security software during malware deployment.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the attackers are engaging in collection activities, which include collecting data from the local system (T1005) and screen capture (T1113).
- These collection activities are consistent with the actions described in the question (collecting system information and capturing screenshots).
- The final step mentioned in the question is exfiltrating this information to a Mattermost server, which is not directly addressed by the TTPs but is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
