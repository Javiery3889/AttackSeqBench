Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Powersing, after capturing periodic screenshots and executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts from a C&C server, is likely to use public services and dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation refers to impersonating legitimate protocols or services to communicate with the C&C server, which can help blend traffic into legitimate traffic.
T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver is a technique where an attacker uses a dead drop resolver to store data on a public service and retrieve it later, which can be used to blend communication into legitimate traffic.
T1059.001-PowerShell is the technique used by Powersing to execute arbitrary scripts, which is a common method for post-compromise activities.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- Powersing is already using PowerShell (T1059.001) to execute scripts, which is a technique that can be used in conjunction with other methods to blend traffic. The use of dead drop resolvers (T1102.001) is a plausible method to store data and blend communication into legitimate traffic. Protocol or Service Impersonation (T1001.003) could also be used to blend traffic, but it is not directly mentioned in the question.

B: No
- The use of dead drop resolvers (T1102.001) is a plausible method to store data and blend communication into legitimate traffic. However, the question does not provide enough information to definitively say that Powersing will not use public services or dead drop resolvers.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Powersing is already using PowerShell to execute scripts, which is a technique that can be used in conjunction with other methods to blend traffic.
- The use of dead drop resolvers is a plausible method to store data and blend communication into legitimate traffic, as it is a technique that is often used by attackers.
- Protocol or Service Impersonation is a technique that can be used to blend traffic, but it is not directly mentioned in the question.

Given the information provided and the plausible use of dead drop resolvers, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
