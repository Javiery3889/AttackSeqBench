Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether CosmicDuke, a known threat actor, is likely to use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives for files and skipping certain file types. The question is specifically about the sequence of actions taken by the threat actor.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media: This technique refers to the act of collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data: This technique refers to the act of collecting data from the clipboard, which is the temporary storage for data copied to or cut from the clipboard.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of actions described in the question is:
1. Searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types.
2. Using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
3. Exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

Given the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after collecting data from removable media. The TTP T1115-Clipboard Data is directly related to the second action in the sequence, which is collecting data from the clipboard. This TTP is consistent with the question's scenario.

B: No - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke will not use a clipboard stealer after collecting data from removable media. However, the TTP T1115-Clipboard Data indicates that clipboard data collection is a technique used by threat actors, which aligns with the second action in the sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions that CosmicDuke is likely to take.
2. The related TTPs provide context to the actions taken by the threat actor.
3. The TTP T1115-Clipboard Data is directly related to the second action in the sequence, which is collecting data from the clipboard.
4. The TTP T1025-Data from Removable Media is related to the first action, which is searching removable drives for files.

Based on the provided TTPs and the sequence of actions, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives for files.

Final Answer: A: Yes
