Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, Dropping Elephant, has already executed and is in the process of downloading encoded blobs. These blobs are then decoded into PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion. The question asks whether it is likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context to the question:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection: This technique involves using automated methods to collect information from a system.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This technique is used to evade detection by deobfuscating or decoding files or information.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique is used to discover files and directories on a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of events described in the question involves:
1. A backdoor (Dropping Elephant) that downloads encoded blobs.
2. Decoding these blobs into PowerShell scripts for defense evasion.

Given this sequence, we can infer the following:
- The backdoor is already in the system and is capable of executing actions.
- The backdoor is using PowerShell scripts, which are known for their flexibility and ability to perform a variety of tasks, including file collection.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: Yes - This suggests that the file-stealer module will indeed iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
B: No - This suggests that the file-stealer module will not iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions.

The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is interested in collecting information (Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection) and has already demonstrated the ability to deobfuscate/decode files (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information). The technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery is also relevant as it is a common step in the process of collecting files.

Considering the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to assume that the file-stealer module would be designed to collect files, which is a typical function of such modules. Automated collection is a common method for this purpose, as it saves time and resources for the attacker.

Final Answer: A: Yes
