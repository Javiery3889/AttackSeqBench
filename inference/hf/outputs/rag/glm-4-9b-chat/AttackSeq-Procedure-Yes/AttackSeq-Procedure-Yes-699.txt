Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Elderwood Project attackers, who have gained initial access via watering hole attacks using zero-day exploits, are likely to establish command and control (C&C) servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a technique where an attacker uses a watering hole attack to compromise a target. T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is a technique where an attacker establishes a two-way communication channel with the compromised system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically mentions that the attackers have already gained initial access using zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks. This aligns with T1189-Drive-by Compromise. After gaining access, it is common for attackers to establish command and control channels to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems. This aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control, which is supported by the Techniques T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication.

Given that the attackers have already demonstrated the ability to use watering hole attacks (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and have a clear need for command and control (Tactic: Command and Control), it is reasonable to assume that they would establish C&C servers to maintain control over the compromised systems.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have used a watering hole attack (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) to gain initial access.
- Establishing command and control (C&C) servers is a common step for attackers to maintain control over compromised systems.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the attackers are likely to use web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and bidirectional communication (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication) for command and control.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish C&C servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
