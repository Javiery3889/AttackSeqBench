Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that malware, after gathering system information, communicates with Command and Control (C&C) servers using application layer protocols. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is typically associated with the use of HTTP, HTTPS, or other application layer protocols for communication with C&C servers.

T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of non-web protocols for command and control communication, which would be lower in the OSI model, such as TCP or UDP.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware uses application layer protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with the C&C servers. This aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a technique for command and control communication.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware does not use application layer protocols for command and control communication. This would align with T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, which is a technique for command and control communication using lower layer protocols.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the malware has gathered system information, which is a common precursor to establishing command and control communication.
- The related TTPs indicate that there are two techniques for command and control communication: one using web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and one using non-application layer protocols (T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol).
- Since the question asks if the malware is likely to use application layer protocols, we should focus on T1071.001-Web Protocols as it directly addresses the use of application layer protocols for command and control.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that the malware uses application layer protocols for command and control communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
