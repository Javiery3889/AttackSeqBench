Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that FIN13, a threat actor, will perform system service discovery after obtaining credentials using specific techniques, and then move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory

T1556-Modify Authentication Process refers to the technique of modifying the authentication process to gain unauthorized access to systems. This could involve using stolen credentials to authenticate to a system.

T1003.001-LSASS Memory is a technique where an attacker uses process memory dumping to extract credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process. This is a common method used by attackers to steal credentials.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
This answer suggests that it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

B: No
This answer suggests that it is not likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

The TTPs provided indicate that FIN13 is already in a position to access systems by modifying the authentication process and by extracting credentials from the LSASS memory. This implies that they have already obtained the necessary credentials to authenticate to systems.

The next logical step for an attacker after obtaining credentials is to understand the environment they have access to. System service discovery is a common step in this process, as it helps the attacker to identify potential targets and understand the network's layout. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells are tools that can be used for lateral movement and further data exfiltration.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that after obtaining credentials, an attacker like FIN13 would likely gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. FIN13 has already obtained credentials using T1556-Modify Authentication Process and T1003.001-LSASS Memory.
2. After obtaining credentials, the next logical step for an attacker is to gather information about the environment.
3. System service discovery is a common method used to gather such information.
4. WMI and custom web shells are tools that can be used for lateral movement in the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
