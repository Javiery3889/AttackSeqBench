Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the TDrop2 malware, after discovery activities, is likely to communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding
- Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding

The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes T1132 as "Command and Control," which includes techniques for adversaries to communicate with their C2 servers. T1132.001 refers to the use of standard encoding, which typically means using a standard base64 encoding without any custom alphabet. T1132.002 refers to non-standard encoding, which could imply the use of a custom base64 alphabet.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the information from the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that TDrop2 malware is likely to use a custom base64 alphabet for encoding commands to communicate with C2 servers. This would be consistent with T1132.002, which is a non-standard encoding technique.

B: No - This answer suggests that TDrop2 malware does not use a custom base64 alphabet for encoding commands. This would be consistent with T1132.001, which is the use of standard encoding.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The question specifically mentions "using a custom base64 alphabet," which is a characteristic of T1132.002. Since the question is asking about the likelihood of TDrop2 using a custom base64 alphabet, the answer that aligns best with the TTPs provided is the one that suggests the use of a non-standard encoding technique.

Final Answer: A: Yes
