Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after gaining initial access through phishing emails with a malicious Word document, an encoded PowerShell script retrieved via a VBS macro is likely to execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which is consistent with the scenario of a malicious Word document being used for initial access.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique refers to the use of PowerShell for malicious purposes, which is relevant to the scenario of an encoded PowerShell script being retrieved and executed.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The scenario described aligns with the TTPs provided. The initial access is gained through a malicious file (T1204.002), and the subsequent execution of a PowerShell script (T1059.001) is a common method for delivering payloads like Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Given that PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute additional payloads, this answer choice is plausible.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the encoded PowerShell script would not execute or would not download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. However, based on the TTPs provided, there is no indication that the script would not execute or that it would not be capable of downloading payloads. Therefore, this answer choice is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is achieved through a malicious file, which is consistent with T1204.002.
- The subsequent execution of a PowerShell script is a technique that is relevant to the scenario, as indicated by T1059.001.
- PowerShell is a common tool used in attacks to download and execute payloads, which is consistent with the potential for Ursnif and GandCrab malware payloads.
- Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the encoded PowerShell script will execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
