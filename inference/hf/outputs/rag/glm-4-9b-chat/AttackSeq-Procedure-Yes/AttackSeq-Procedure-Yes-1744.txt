Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, the threat group (TG1021) is likely to have demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
  - Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
  - Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools

T1070.004-File Deletion is a technique within the Defense Evasion tactic that involves deleting files from the system to avoid detection. T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools is also a technique within the Defense Evasion tactic that involves removing indicators of the tool or malware from the system to avoid detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
This answer suggests that TG1021 would have removed all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy after employing the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

B: No
This answer suggests that TG1021 would not have removed all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy after employing the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

The related TTPs indicate that file deletion (T1070.004) and indicator removal (T1027.005) are common techniques used to evade detection. However, the question specifically mentions "all disk-resident tools," which implies a more comprehensive approach to cleaning up after an operation. While these TTPs are relevant, they do not necessarily indicate that TG1021 would remove all disk-resident tools.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if TG1021 removed all disk-resident tools after using Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
- The related TTPs suggest that file deletion and indicator removal are common defense evasion techniques.
- However, the TTPs do not explicitly state that all disk-resident tools would be removed.
- It is plausible that TG1021 might use these techniques, but the question's specificity about "all disk-resident tools" is not directly supported by the TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
