Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that Hidden Cobra, after gaining initial access to Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878, would develop Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the Resource Development tactic.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

These TTPs indicate that the initial access is achieved through spear phishing, and the exploitation is done by executing a client-side exploit (CVE-2018-4878). This aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is specifically about the development of Bankshot implants, which are a set of tools used by Hidden Cobra to gain full control over systems and perform actions like wiping files. The development of such tools would fall under the Resource Development tactic.

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

- If Hidden Cobra has already exploited CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access, it is plausible that they would develop additional tools like Bankshot implants to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems. This aligns with the Resource Development tactic.
- The related TTPs do not explicitly mention the development of Bankshot implants, but the fact that Hidden Cobra is known for using such tools suggests that it is within their capabilities and tactics.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is achieved through spear phishing, which is consistent with the TTPs provided.
2. The exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 is a technique that aligns with the TTPs.
3. Given that Hidden Cobra is known to use Bankshot implants, it is reasonable to assume they would develop such tools to maintain control over compromised systems.
4. The development of Bankshot implants is a part of the Resource Development tactic.

Final Answer: A: Yes
