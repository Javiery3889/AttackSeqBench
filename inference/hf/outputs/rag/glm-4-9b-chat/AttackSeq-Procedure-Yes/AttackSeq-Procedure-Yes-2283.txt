Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Regin, a sophisticated malware, is likely to perform network traffic monitoring and low-level network traffic sniffing after it has gathered information on processes and memory utilization and scanned for deleted files during the discovery phase of an attack.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing

T1040 is a technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework that refers to "Network Sniffing," which involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information about the network and its users.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that Regin is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes after the discovery phase. This aligns with the T1040 technique, which is a common activity during the discovery phase to gather information about the network.

B: No
- This answer suggests that Regin would not monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic after the discovery phase. This contradicts the T1040 technique, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that Regin has already gathered information on processes and memory utilization and scanned for deleted files, which are part of the discovery phase.
- The related TTP indicates that network sniffing (T1040) is a technique used during the discovery phase to gather information about the network.
- Therefore, it is plausible that Regin, after completing the discovery phase, would continue to use network sniffing to further gather information about the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
