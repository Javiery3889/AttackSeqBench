Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Mandiant would track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution. The question implies that FIN13 has already exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK for Initial Access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell

These TTPs are relevant to the question because they describe actions that could be part of the Reconnaissance and Execution phases of an attack. Specifically:
- T1505.003-Web Shell is a technique used for persistence on a compromised system, which could be part of the Reconnaissance phase.
- T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the network, which is a key part of the Reconnaissance phase.
- T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is a technique used for execution, which is part of the Execution phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that Mandiant would track FIN13 for gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase. Given that T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is a technique used for Discovery (Reconnaissance), this answer is plausible.

B: No
- This answer suggests that Mandiant would not track FIN13 for gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase. However, since the TTPs provided include a technique that is part of the Reconnaissance phase, this answer is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if Mandiant would track FIN13 for Reconnaissance activities before employing JSPRAT for Execution.
- The related TTPs include a technique (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery) that is part of the Reconnaissance phase.
- Based on the provided TTPs, it is plausible that Mandiant would track FIN13 for Reconnaissance activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
