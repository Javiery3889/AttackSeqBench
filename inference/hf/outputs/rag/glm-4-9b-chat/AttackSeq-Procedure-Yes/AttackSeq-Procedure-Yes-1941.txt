Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Smooth Operator malware, after establishing communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTPS and using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by malware to communicate with its C2 servers in a way that is less likely to be detected by security systems.

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the technique of exfiltrating data through the same channel used for command and control communication. This technique is used to avoid detection by exfiltrating data in a manner that is consistent with the normal traffic of the C2 channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware will automatically exfiltrate data using a HTTP GET request. Given that T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique for exfiltrating data through the C2 channel, it is plausible that the malware could use a HTTP GET request as part of this technique.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware will not automatically exfiltrate data using a HTTP GET request. However, the TTPs provided do not explicitly state that the malware will not use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration. It only states that the exfiltration will occur over the C2 channel, which is consistent with using a HTTP GET request if that is the protocol chosen by the malware.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the malware's communication with C2 servers over HTTPS and the use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the malware uses web protocols for command and control (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and exfiltrates data over the C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
- While the TTPs do not explicitly state that a HTTP GET request will be used for exfiltration, the use of web protocols and exfiltration over the C2 channel are consistent with using a HTTP GET request.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the malware could use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
