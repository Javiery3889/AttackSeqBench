Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the netd component of Infamous Chisel, after collecting files, will likely exfiltrate those files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections during the Exfiltration phase. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection

T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a compromised system. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel involves exfiltrating data through a command and control (C2) channel. T1119-Automated Collection is the technique used by Infamous Chisel in the Collection phase to automatically collect files.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically mentions that the netd component of Infamous Chisel will exfiltrate the collected files. We need to evaluate the likelihood of this exfiltration being done through a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

- T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a general technique that does not specify the method of exfiltration. It could include using a Tor hidden service, SSH, or any other method.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the exfiltration is done through a C2 channel, which could be a direct connection or a hidden service, but it does not specify the use of Tor or SSH.
- T1119-Automated Collection is not directly related to the exfiltration method but confirms that the collection phase is automated.

Given the information provided, we can infer that the exfiltration method is not specified in the TTPs. However, since the question asks about the likelihood of using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that the exfiltration will indeed use a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
B: No - This answer suggests that the exfiltration will not use a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The question asks about the likelihood of using a specific exfiltration method (Tor hidden service and SSH connections). While the TTPs do not explicitly mention these methods, they do not rule them out either. Since the question is about the likelihood, we must consider that any of the TTPs could be used in conjunction with the exfiltration method in question.

However, since the TTPs provided do not specifically mention the use of a Tor hidden service or SSH connections, we cannot definitively conclude that these methods will be used. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the exfiltration will not use these methods.

Final Answer: B: No
