Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase of an attack on medical infrastructure. The reconnaissance phase has already been completed using tools like masscan, which identified Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
  - Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique involves identifying and mapping the network and system resources of a target environment.
  - Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique involves identifying and enumerating files, directories, and other objects on a target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question's scenario involves reconnaissance on medical infrastructure, which is a part of the Discovery Tactic. The techniques T1018 and T1083 are both relevant to the Discovery Tactic.

- T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique is about discovering the remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase where tools like masscan are used to identify systems with specific protocols and interfaces.
- T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique is about discovering files and directories, which is a step that typically follows system discovery to enumerate the content of the systems.

Given that the reconnaissance phase has already identified specific systems, the next logical step would be to enumerate the files and directories on those systems to gather more information. Therefore, it is plausible that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings would be retrieved during the discovery phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a reconnaissance phase that has already been completed.
2. The reconnaissance phase identified specific systems with known vulnerabilities.
3. The next step in the attack sequence is the discovery phase, which involves identifying and enumerating files and directories.
4. The related TTPs include techniques that are relevant to both reconnaissance and discovery phases.
5. Given the context and the related TTPs, it is likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
