Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that attackers rebooted the target system after completing wiping processes, rather than launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'. The context here is that FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers in this campaign.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This suggests that the attackers used encryption or encoding to evade detection.
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service: This indicates that the attackers caused a denial of service at the endpoint level, which is consistent with a DDoS attack.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question:

A: Yes
- The observation of single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files could be part of a defense evasion technique to avoid detection. However, this does not necessarily imply that the attackers rebooted the system after the wiping processes.
- The TTP related to endpoint denial of service (T1499) suggests that the attackers did indeed launch a DDoS attack, which is inconsistent with the idea that they rebooted the system instead.

B: No
- The TTPs provided do not directly indicate that the attackers rebooted the system. The T1499 technique is consistent with the DDoS attacks mentioned in the question.
- The fact that the attackers used encoding techniques (T1027.013) could be part of a broader attack that includes both defense evasion and the DDoS attack, but it does not necessarily mean they rebooted the system.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs suggest that the attackers were engaged in activities that are consistent with launching a DDoS attack, not rebooting the system.
- The use of encoding techniques (T1027.013) is a method to evade detection, which could be part of a broader attack that includes the DDoS attack.
- There is no direct evidence in the TTPs provided that indicates a reboot of the system after the wiping processes.

Final Answer: B: No
