Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether data exfiltration will occur over commonly used ports only after a fallback Command and Control (C&C) server becomes operational. The context is an attack sequence that includes the Collection phase, where malware is used to scan for files and stage data for exfiltration.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- Tactic: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external destination.
- Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - This technique refers to the use of a Command and Control channel for exfiltrating data.
- Tactic: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication between the attacker's infrastructure and the compromised system.
- Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels - This technique involves the use of alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is unavailable or blocked.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the fallback C&C server is embedded in the configuration and is used only if the primary C&C server is not operational. Given this context, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer implies that the data will be sent over commonly used ports only after the fallback C&C server is operational. This would be consistent with the use of fallback channels, as the fallback server would only be used when the primary server is not available.

B: No - This answer suggests that the data will be sent over commonly used ports regardless of the operational status of the fallback C&C server. This would not align with the use of fallback channels, as the fallback server is intended to be used when the primary server is not operational.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the fallback C&C server is embedded in the configuration and is used only after the primary C&C server becomes operational for communications.
- The use of fallback channels (T1008) implies that the fallback server is a secondary option for communication.
- Therefore, it is logical to conclude that data would be sent over commonly used ports only after the fallback C&C server is operational, as it is a fallback mechanism.

Final Answer: A: Yes
