Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Longhorn's malware, after communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration, will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by malware to communicate with its C&C server using HTTP, HTTPS, or other web protocols. T1029-Scheduled Transfer is a technique where malware uses scheduled tasks to transfer data at specific times to avoid detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the malware is already communicating externally for exfiltration, which aligns with T1029-Scheduled Transfer. The next step in the sequence is to determine if the malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

Given the TTPs provided:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols suggests that the malware is likely to use web protocols for C&C communication.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer indicates that the malware is already using scheduled transfers for exfiltration.

The question specifically asks if the malware will use a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communication. While T1071.001-Web Protocols does not explicitly mention custom cryptographic protocols, it does cover the use of HTTPS, which is a secure protocol that uses cryptographic methods. However, the question's focus on a "custom cryptographic protocol" is not directly addressed by the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware is already using scheduled transfers for exfiltration, which is consistent with T1029-Scheduled Transfer.
2. The malware is likely to use web protocols for C&C communication, as indicated by T1071.001-Web Protocols.
3. The use of HTTPS is a form of secure communication that uses cryptographic methods, but the question specifically asks about a "custom cryptographic protocol," which is not explicitly mentioned in the TTPs provided.
4. Without explicit information about the use of a custom cryptographic protocol in the TTPs, we cannot definitively conclude that the malware will use one.

Final Answer: B: No
