Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers and execute remote commands after deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, which disrupted the bank's operations during the heist.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery

T1070.004-File Deletion is a technique used to delete files that could be used for system recovery or to prevent analysis of the system. This is consistent with the ransomware's action of deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, which aligns with the question's description of the ransomware's behavior.

T1490-Inhibit System Recovery is a technique used to prevent the recovery of the system, which is also consistent with the ransomware's action of deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is asking if the Lazarus group used backdoor malware after deploying Hermes ransomware. The related TTPs do not directly mention the use of backdoor malware. However, the sequence of actions described in the question (deploying ransomware, deleting backup files, and then using backdoor malware) is plausible in the context of a cyber attack.

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Given that the question asks if the backdoor malware was used "only afterwards," it implies that the backdoor malware was used after the ransomware actions. The related TTPs do not provide explicit evidence that the backdoor malware was used, but they do not contradict the possibility either.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of events where ransomware is deployed, followed by the deletion of backup files, and then the use of backdoor malware.
- The related TTPs are consistent with the ransomware's actions but do not explicitly mention the use of backdoor malware.
- The question asks if the backdoor malware was used "only afterwards," which implies that it was used after the ransomware actions.
- The absence of explicit evidence in the related TTPs does not negate the possibility that the backdoor malware was used.

Final Answer: A: Yes
