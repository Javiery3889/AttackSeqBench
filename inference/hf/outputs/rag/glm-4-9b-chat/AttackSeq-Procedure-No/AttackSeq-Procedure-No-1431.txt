Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Smooth Operator malware, after exfiltrating data using a HTTP GET request, is likely to establish communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by malware to communicate with C2 servers to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the technique of exfiltrating data through the C2 channel. This could involve using various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, or other web protocols.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware is likely to use HTTPS for C2 communication and a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. HTTPS is a secure protocol that encrypts data in transit, which is a common practice for malware to avoid detection. Custom data encoding algorithms are also a common method to obfuscate data to evade detection. This answer aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware is not likely to use HTTPS for C2 communication or a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. However, the TTPs provided do not explicitly rule out the use of HTTPS or custom encoding. It is possible that the malware could use these methods, especially since HTTPS is a common practice for secure communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that the malware uses web protocols for command and control and exfiltration. HTTPS is a secure web protocol that is commonly used for C2 communication, and custom data encoding is a common method for obfuscation.
- Based on the TTPs and the common practices in malware communication, it is reasonable to assume that the malware could use HTTPS and a custom encoding algorithm.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that the malware will use HTTPS and a custom data encoding algorithm.

Final Answer: A: Yes
