Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the malware from the FHAPPI campaign, which delivered an APT phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website, would install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution. The context here is the sequence of actions taken by the malware after the initial delivery and execution.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron: This technique involves using the cron utility to execute commands at scheduled times.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves executing a malicious file on the target system.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron: This technique is related to maintaining persistence on the system by using cron jobs.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is specifically about the method of installation for the malware, whether it will use cron jobs or PowerShell. The related TTPs suggest that the malware could potentially use cron jobs (T1053.003-Cron) for persistence or execution. However, the TTPs do not provide any information about PowerShell being used or not.

The TTPs indicate that the malware could use cron jobs for persistence, but they do not explicitly state that it will use cron jobs for installation. The use of cron jobs is typically associated with maintaining persistence rather than the initial installation of malware. PowerShell, on the other hand, is a common tool used by attackers for automation and execution of scripts on Windows systems.

Given the information provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that the malware will install itself as a cron job. However, the TTPs do not provide evidence that the malware will use cron jobs for installation, only for persistence.

B: No - This answer suggests that the malware will not install itself as a cron job. This is a more plausible answer based on the TTPs provided, as they do not indicate that cron jobs are used for installation but rather for persistence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that the malware could use cron jobs for persistence (T1053.003-Cron).
- The TTPs do not mention PowerShell or indicate that it will be used for installation.
- The question asks whether the malware will install itself as a cron job, which is not explicitly supported by the TTPs.
- The most plausible answer is that the malware will not install itself as a cron job, as the TTPs suggest cron jobs are used for persistence rather than installation.

Final Answer: B: No
