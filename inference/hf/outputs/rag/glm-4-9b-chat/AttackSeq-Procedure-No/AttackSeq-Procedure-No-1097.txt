Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether CosmicDuke, a known threat actor, is likely to use specific tools (keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer) to gather information after exfiltrating data via FTP and after searching removable drives while skipping certain file types during the collection phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This indicates that the threat actor is using automated methods to exfiltrate data.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging: This suggests that the threat actor is using keylogging as a method of data collection.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This indicates that the threat actor is collecting data from the local system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
To determine the sequence of TTPs, let's evaluate the answer choices based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that CosmicDuke uses the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data via FTP and after searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.
- The TTPs provided do not explicitly state the order of the actions, but they do indicate that keylogging (T1056.001) and collecting data from the local system (T1005) are part of the collection phase.
- The question implies that the threat actor is gathering information after exfiltration, which could be a follow-up action to the initial collection phase.

B: No
- This answer suggests that CosmicDuke does not use the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltration.
- However, the TTPs provided do not contradict the use of these tools after exfiltration. They only specify the methods used during the collection phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided do not explicitly state the sequence of actions after exfiltration, but they do indicate that keylogging and collecting data from the local system are part of the collection phase.
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use these tools after exfiltration, which is not directly contradicted by the TTPs.
- Given that the TTPs do not provide enough information to definitively say that the tools would not be used after exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that they could be used in that sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
