Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the SBDH malware, after using HTTP and SMTP protocols for network communication with its Command and Control (C&C) server, will then use powerful filters to specify and collect targeted data based on criteria such as file extension, creation date, and file size.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols

These TTPs indicate that the malware is using web and mail protocols for command and control, and it is capable of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel. T1071.001 and T1071.003 are techniques that involve using HTTP and SMTP protocols, respectively, which aligns with the malware's use of these protocols as mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically asks about the malware's ability to employ filters to collect targeted data. The provided TTPs do not directly mention data filtering based on file extension, creation date, and file size. However, we can infer the following:

- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the malware is capable of exfiltrating data, which could imply that it has some form of data collection mechanism.
- The use of HTTP and SMTP protocols for command and control does not inherently suggest data filtering capabilities.

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the malware will employ powerful filters to specify and collect targeted data based on the criteria mentioned. The TTPs do not provide explicit evidence of such filtering capabilities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question asks about the malware's ability to filter data based on specific criteria.
2. The provided TTPs show that the malware uses HTTP and SMTP for command and control and can exfiltrate data.
3. The TTPs do not mention data filtering based on file extension, creation date, and file size.
4. Therefore, we cannot confirm that the malware will employ such filters based on the given information.

Final Answer: B: No
