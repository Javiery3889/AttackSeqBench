Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after APT28's malicious document uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique via PowerShell to execute encoded commands, it is likely that the document will hijack legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange

T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique used to bypass security controls by manipulating the DLL search order. This technique is not directly related to hijacking startup scripts or enabling malware execution on system startup.

T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange is a technique that allows an attacker to execute code by leveraging the DDE feature of applications. This technique is directly related to the initial part of the question, as it describes how the malicious document achieves execution.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question focuses on the likelihood of the document hijacking startup scripts after using DDE via PowerShell. The provided TTPs do not directly support the idea of hijacking startup scripts. T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking is not relevant to the question, and T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange is the technique used for initial execution but does not inherently involve hijacking startup scripts.

Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence that the TTPs listed would lead to the hijacking of startup scripts. Therefore, the answer should be based on the absence of evidence for this specific action rather than the evidence provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the likelihood of the document hijacking startup scripts after using DDE via PowerShell.
- The provided TTPs do not include any technique that is specifically related to hijacking startup scripts.
- The TTPs provided are focused on defense evasion and execution, but not on the specific action of hijacking startup scripts.

Final Answer: B: No
