Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes, it is likely that it performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

The TTPs are categorized into Tactic and Technique. The Tactic "Discovery" is related to gathering information about the environment, while "Exfiltration" is related to stealing data from the target environment. The Techniques listed are specific actions that fall under these tactics.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is focused on whether the implant performed reconnaissance after establishing command and control communication. Let's evaluate the answer choices based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the implant performed reconnaissance after establishing command and control communication. The TTPs provided include techniques that are part of the Discovery Tactic, which is consistent with the idea of reconnaissance. T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery are both relevant to gathering information about the network and system configuration, which is a common step in reconnaissance.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the implant did not perform reconnaissance after establishing command and control communication. However, the TTPs provided do not directly support this conclusion. The TTPs are related to discovery and exfiltration, which could be part of reconnaissance activities or other stages of an attack.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the implant performed reconnaissance after establishing command and control communication.
- The related TTPs include techniques that are part of the Discovery Tactic, which is consistent with reconnaissance activities.
- The TTPs do not provide evidence that the implant did not perform reconnaissance.

Final Answer: A: Yes
