Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether T9000, after exfiltrating data to a Command and Control (C2) server using compressed and encrypted network traffic, is likely to target Skype users, automatically capture data from removable media, and steal sensitive files only after evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid analysis by security researchers and security products.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.001-Binary Padding
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a compromised system to a C2 server. T1027.001-Binary Padding is a technique used to evade detection by adding unnecessary data to a binary file, which can make it harder for security products to identify the malicious code. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique where data is exfiltrated through the C2 communication channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- T9000 is already exfiltrating data to a C2 server, which aligns with T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
- The question also mentions that T9000 customizes its installation to avoid detection, which is consistent with T1027.001-Binary Padding.
- The question does not specify that T9000 targets Skype users or automatically captures data from removable media, but these actions could be part of a broader attack pattern that T9000 might employ.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that T9000 does not exhibit the behaviors described in the question, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that T9000 is capable of exfiltrating data, evading detection, and communicating with a C2 server, which are all consistent with the question's description.
- The question does not specify that T9000 targets Skype users or automatically captures data from removable media, but these actions could be part of a broader attack pattern.
- Given the information provided, it is plausible that T9000 could target Skype users and automatically capture data from removable media, as these actions are not explicitly contradicted by the TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
