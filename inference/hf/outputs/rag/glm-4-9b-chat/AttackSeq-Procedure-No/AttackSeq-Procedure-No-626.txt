Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after establishing communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling: This technique involves using a protocol like DNS or HTTP to tunnel commands and data to and from a C2 server.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique refers to exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communication.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol without encryption.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifies that the CostaRicto Campaign has already established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. This means that the C2 channel is already established and being used for command and control.

Given the TTPs provided:
- T1572 is the technique used to establish the C2 communication channel.
- T1041 suggests that the C2 channel is used for exfiltration as well.
- T1048.003 suggests exfiltration over a non-C2 protocol, which is not the established C2 channel.

The question asks if the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. Since HTTPS and SMTPS are both secure protocols, it is less likely that the attacker would choose to exfiltrate data over these protocols without encryption, especially after already using a protocol tunneling technique for command and control. Additionally, T1048.003 specifically mentions exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols, which does not align with the established C2 channel.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to continue using the established C2 channel for exfiltration, which is in line with T1041.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The CostaRicto Campaign has established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP (T1572).
2. The established C2 channel is typically used for both command and control and exfiltration (T1041).
3. The use of HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration would be less likely due to the secure nature of these protocols and the established C2 channel.
4. Exfiltration over a non-C2 protocol (T1048.003) is not in line with the established C2 channel.

Final Answer: B: No
