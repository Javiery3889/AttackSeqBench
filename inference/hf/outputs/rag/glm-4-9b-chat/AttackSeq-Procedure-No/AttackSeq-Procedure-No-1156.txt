Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that attackers, after collecting Instagram credentials through phishing sites, will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials: This indicates that the attackers are gathering information, specifically Instagram credentials.
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts: This suggests that the attackers are developing resources, possibly by using email accounts for further communication or control.
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop: This technique involves stopping services, which could imply disrupting the target's operations.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs provided do not explicitly state that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups. The TTP "Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop" suggests that the attackers may stop services, but it does not specify which services. The question asks about services related to backups, which is not directly mentioned in the TTPs.

B: No
- The TTPs do not provide any indication that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups. The TTP "Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop" is a general technique that could apply to any service, not necessarily those related to backups.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided do not give a clear indication that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups. The TTP "Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop" is a general technique that could be used in various contexts, not specifically for stopping services related to backups.
- Therefore, based on the information given, it is not plausible to conclude that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

Final Answer: B: No
