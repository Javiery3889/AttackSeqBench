Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used after a backdoor configuration that includes encryption/decryption keys and XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses. The question specifically mentions the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable', which are Windows API functions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which can be used to bypass security controls.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking: This technique is used to block or hide indicators of malicious activity, which can include blocking or modifying system functions.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the backdoor has already been configured with encryption and XOR-encrypted communication, which are methods to evade detection. The next step in the attack sequence is likely to be further evading detection by using techniques that are commonly associated with malware that has already established a presence on a system.

- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that API hooking techniques will be used. API hooking is a method that can be used to intercept and modify the behavior of system functions, such as 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable'. This is a plausible step after establishing a backdoor, as it would allow the malware to interact with the system at a deeper level, potentially to hide its presence or to perform other malicious actions.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that API hooking techniques will not be used. However, given that the backdoor is already configured to communicate with a C&C server in an encrypted manner, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would want to further obfuscate their activities to avoid detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The backdoor has been configured with encryption and XOR-encrypted communication, indicating an attempt to evade detection.
2. The use of 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' suggests that the malware is interacting with the operating system at a low level.
3. API hooking is a technique that can be used to modify system functions and is often associated with malware that wants to remain undetected.
4. Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the attackers would use API hooking to further evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
