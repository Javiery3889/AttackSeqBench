Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the data collected from victims' Telegram accounts by Yellow Garuda is divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. The context here is the use of a 'grabber' tool to collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from Telegram accounts.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration
  - Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
  - Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the exfiltration of data through a command and control (C2) channel. This technique is often used to avoid detection by exfiltrating data through a channel that is less likely to be monitored.

T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits refers to the limitation of the size of data transferred to evade detection. This technique is used to avoid triggering intrusion detection systems by not sending large amounts of data in a single transfer.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
This answer suggests that it is likely that the data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. This aligns with T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, which is a technique used to avoid detection by limiting the size of data transfers.

B: No
This answer suggests that it is not likely that the data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. However, given the related TTPs, this seems less plausible, as T1030 explicitly mentions the use of data transfer size limits to evade detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the collection of data from Telegram accounts using a 'grabber' tool.
- The related TTPs include techniques that are used to evade detection during exfiltration.
- T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits is a technique that aligns with the idea of dividing data into fixed-size chunks to avoid detection.
- The answer choice A (Yes) is more in line with the TTPs provided and the context of the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
