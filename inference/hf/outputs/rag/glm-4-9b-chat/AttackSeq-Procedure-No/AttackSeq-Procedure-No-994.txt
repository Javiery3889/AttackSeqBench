Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the malware named PROMETHIUM, which searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives during the Collection phase, is likely to exfiltrate data to a Command and Control (C2) server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration
  - Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
  - Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a compromised system. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that the exfiltration is done through a C2 channel, which is a common method for malware to communicate with its command and control server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes. Given that T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique that can be used to automate the exfiltration process, it is plausible that the malware could be designed to exfiltrate data at regular intervals. However, the frequency of exfiltration (every 10 minutes) is not specified in the TTPs.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware will not exfiltrate data every 10 minutes. While T1020-Automated Exfiltration does not specify the frequency of exfiltration, it does not necessarily mean that the malware will not exfiltrate at all. The TTPs do not provide information about the specific timing of exfiltration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that the malware is capable of automated exfiltration and can do so over a C2 channel.
- The frequency of exfiltration (every 10 minutes) is not explicitly mentioned in the TTPs.
- Given that the TTPs do not provide information about the frequency of exfiltration, we cannot definitively conclude that the malware will or will not exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.

Final Answer: B: No

The final answer is "No" because the TTPs do not provide enough information to conclude that the malware will exfiltrate data every 10 minutes. While the malware is capable of automated exfiltration over a C2 channel, the specific timing of exfiltration is not specified.
