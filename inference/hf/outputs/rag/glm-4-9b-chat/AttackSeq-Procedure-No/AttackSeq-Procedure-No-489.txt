Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will perform two specific actions—collecting system information and probing files—as part of the Discovery phase, following the action of dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the system, which is typically part of the Discovery phase. T1003-OS Credential Dumping is a technique used to extract credentials from operating systems, which is part of the Credential Access phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the sequence of actions is:
1. Dump credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz (T1003-OS Credential Dumping)
2. Collect system information and probe files (T1082-System Information Discovery)

Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This suggests that after credential dumping, FamousSparrow will proceed to collect system information and probe files.
B: No - This suggests that after credential dumping, FamousSparrow will not proceed to collect system information and probe files.

The sequence of TTPs provided indicates that the Credential Access phase (T1003-OS Credential Dumping) comes before the Discovery phase (T1082-System Information Discovery). Therefore, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would perform the Discovery phase actions after Credential Access.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The TTPs provided show that Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping) is a phase that precedes Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery).
2. The question asks if FamousSparrow will perform Discovery actions after Credential Access.
3. Given the sequence of TTPs, it is logical that after gaining access to credentials, the attacker would then proceed to gather more information about the system.
4. Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase after dumping credentials.

Final Answer: A: Yes
