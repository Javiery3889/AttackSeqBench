Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Seaduke, after retrieving system information and deleting itself, will calculate the command-and-control (C2) port using a specific method involving IP address manipulation. The method described is multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.003-DNS Calculation
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution

T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the network configuration of a system. This is relevant to the first part of the question, as Seaduke is retrieving system information.

T1568.003-DNS Calculation and T1568-Dynamic Resolution are both techniques related to command and control. T1568.003-DNS Calculation involves calculating a C2 port using DNS resolution, while T1568-Dynamic Resolution is a more general technique that involves dynamically resolving C2 communication endpoints.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that Seaduke will calculate the C2 port using the described IP address manipulation method. This is not directly aligned with the TTPs provided, as the TTPs mention DNS calculation and dynamic resolution, not IP address manipulation.

B: No
- This answer suggests that Seaduke will not calculate the C2 port using the described IP address manipulation method. This aligns with the TTPs provided, as they do not mention IP address manipulation but rather DNS calculation and dynamic resolution.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about a specific method of calculating a C2 port, which is not mentioned in the provided TTPs.
- The TTPs provided are related to system discovery and command and control techniques, but they do not include the IP address manipulation method described in the question.
- Based on the analysis, the answer choice that aligns best with the TTPs is B: No, as it is not mentioned that Seaduke will use the IP address manipulation method for calculating the C2 port.

Final Answer: B: No
