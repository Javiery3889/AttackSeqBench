Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, after establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, would perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase of an attack.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery

The TTPs indicate that the backdoor is using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication, which is a Command and Control technique (T1572 and T1071.004). Additionally, the TTPs mention a Discovery technique (T1057), which is related to process discovery.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is specifically about the Discovery phase, which is a phase where an attacker gathers information about the target environment. The TTPs provided include a technique that is directly related to the Discovery phase (T1057-Process Discovery). Since the backdoor has already established a C2 channel, it is reasonable to assume that it would proceed with the Discovery phase to understand the target environment better.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer suggests that the backdoor would perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase, which is consistent with the TTPs provided.

Answer Choice B: No - This answer suggests that the backdoor would not perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor performing Discovery phase activities after establishing a C2 channel.
- The TTPs provided include a technique (T1057-Process Discovery) that is directly related to the Discovery phase.
- Since the backdoor has already established a C2 channel, it is reasonable to assume that it would proceed with the Discovery phase to gather information about the target environment.
- Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the TTPs and the context of the question is that the backdoor would perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
