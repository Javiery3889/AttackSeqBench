Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that attackers will use specific tools (Nmap and Mimikatz) for network mapping and password collection after using PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, and only after executing a GreyEnergy mini via spearphishing emails.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash

T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer refers to the use of legitimate tools to move laterally within a network. PsExec and WinExe are examples of tools that can be used for this purpose. T1550.002-Pass the Hash is a technique where an attacker uses stolen credentials to gain access to other systems without requiring a password.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that after using PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, the attackers will use Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and password collection. This is plausible because Nmap is a common tool for network mapping, and Mimikatz is used for extracting credentials, which aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the attackers will not use Nmap and Mimikatz after lateral movement. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no information that contradicts the use of these tools after lateral movement. Therefore, this answer is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of events where attackers use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, which is consistent with T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer. 
- The question also mentions that the attackers execute GreyEnergy mini via spearphishing emails, which is a separate action but does not necessarily dictate the sequence of tools used for network mapping and password collection.
- The TTPs provided include T1550.002-Pass the Hash, which is a technique that could be used after lateral movement to collect passwords, and Nmap, which is a tool for network mapping.
- Based on the information given, it is plausible that the attackers would use Nmap and Mimikatz after lateral movement to further their objectives.

Final Answer: A: Yes
