Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Lazarus group, after deploying Hermes ransomware and encrypting files, would establish command and control (C2) communication using backdoor malware to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact: This indicates that the ransomware's primary function is to encrypt data for the purpose of impact, which is consistent with the deployment of Hermes ransomware.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography: This suggests that the C2 communication might involve the use of symmetric cryptography, which is a method that could be used for encrypting the communication between the backdoor malware and the C&C servers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The deployment of ransomware is a clear indication of an attack with the intent to impact the victim's data. 
- The use of backdoor malware to establish C2 communication is a common TTP for attackers to maintain persistence on the compromised system and receive further instructions.
- The use of symmetric cryptography for C2 communication is a plausible technique, as it can be more efficient than asymmetric encryption like RSA for encrypting large amounts of data.

B: No
- There is no information provided that directly contradicts the use of backdoor malware for C2 communication. The TTPs provided do not suggest that the Lazarus group would not use backdoor malware for C2.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The deployment of Hermes ransomware aligns with the T1486 technique, which is about encrypting data for impact.
- The Tactic: Command and Control suggests that the attackers would need a method to communicate with the compromised systems.
- The Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography is a plausible method for C2 communication, though it is not directly related to the use of backdoor malware.
- Given that the use of backdoor malware for C2 is a common practice in cyber attacks and there is no information suggesting that the Lazarus group would not use it, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would include the use of backdoor malware for C2 communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
