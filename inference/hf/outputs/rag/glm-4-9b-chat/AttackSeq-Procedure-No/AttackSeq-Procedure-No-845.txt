Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether an Office document, which has delivered the KerrDown malware via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading, is likely to use base64 encoded blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTP (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File) suggests that the attack involves the execution of a malicious file. T1204.002 specifically refers to the execution of a malicious file that is designed to be delivered through a malicious document, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that the Office document is likely to use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros. This could be plausible if the malware is designed to be highly adaptive and capable of determining the system architecture to execute the payload accordingly.

B: No - This answer suggests that the Office document is not likely to use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros. This could be plausible if the malware is not designed to be adaptive in this manner or if the use of base64 encoding is not a typical characteristic of the malware.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The use of base64 encoding to execute a payload based on system architecture is not a common practice, as malware typically relies on other methods to adapt to the target environment. However, it is not impossible, especially if the malware is designed to be highly sophisticated and adaptive. The presence of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a common social engineering technique used to deceive users into executing the malicious payload.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the Office document uses base64 encoding to execute the payload based on the system architecture, followed by the image file to instruct the user to enable macros. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
