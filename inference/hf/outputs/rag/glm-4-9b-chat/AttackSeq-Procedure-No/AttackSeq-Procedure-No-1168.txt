Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites after identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains. The question is specifically about the sequence of actions taken by the actors and whether location information collection is a plausible step in that sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains: This technique involves actors using domain information to identify potential targets.
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations: This technique is about determining the physical locations of individuals or organizations.
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains: This technique involves actors searching open websites and domains to gather information about potential targets.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the actors are engaged in reconnaissance activities. T1583.001-Domains and T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains are both reconnaissance techniques that could be used to identify potential targets. However, T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations is a technique that could be used to collect location information. Since the actors are in the reconnaissance phase, it is plausible that they would collect as much information as possible about their targets, including location information if it is relevant to their objectives.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the actors did not collect location information. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no explicit indication that collecting location information is not part of their reconnaissance activities. Therefore, this answer choice is less plausible based on the information given.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The actors are in the reconnaissance phase, which involves gathering information about potential targets.
- The TTPs provided include techniques that are used for reconnaissance, such as searching open websites and domains (T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains) and using domain information (T1583.001-Domains).
- One of the techniques listed (T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations) is specifically about collecting location information, which is a plausible action during reconnaissance.
- There is no information provided that contradicts the idea that the actors would collect location information as part of their reconnaissance activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
