Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has evaded defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. The question then asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victimâ€™s machine.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie

Tactic: Credential Access is a broad category that includes various techniques for accessing credentials. Technique T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers specifically refers to the act of extracting credentials from web browsers. Technique T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie is a more specific technique that involves stealing session cookies from web browsers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is involved in the attack sequence. Given the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is capable of stealing browser cookies. Since T1555.003 and T1539 are related to credential access and stealing web session cookies, respectively, this answer is plausible.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is not capable of stealing browser cookies. However, given the related TTPs, there is no information that contradicts the capability of the Dropping Elephant backdoor to perform this action.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the use of PowerShell scripts to download malware, which is consistent with the capabilities of the Dropping Elephant backdoor.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is interested in credential access, which includes stealing web session cookies.
- There is no information provided that contradicts the Dropping Elephant backdoor's ability to steal browser cookies.

Final Answer: A: Yes
