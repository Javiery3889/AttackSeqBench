Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether FIN13, a threat actor, is likely to use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement after conducting internal reconnaissance. The question also mentions that the actor has already collected data from network shared drives and is targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery

T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer refers to the technique of transferring tools from one system to another within a network. T1072-Software Deployment Tools is the use of software deployment tools to move tools across a network. T1083-File and Directory Discovery is the technique of identifying files and directories on a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that FIN13 is likely to use lateral movement techniques. T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is a direct match for moving tools across the network, and T1072-Software Deployment Tools could be used to deploy AvosLocker and other tools. This answer choice aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that FIN13 does not use software deployment tools for lateral movement, which contradicts the TTPs provided. The TTPs suggest that lateral movement is a tactic used by FIN13, and software deployment tools are a technique that could be employed for this purpose.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where FIN13 has already conducted internal reconnaissance and collected data from network shared drives. This suggests that the actor is already within the network and has a presence that needs to be expanded.
- The TTPs provided indicate that lateral movement is a tactic used by FIN13, and software deployment tools are a technique that can be used for lateral movement.
- Given that the actor is already within the network and has a need to expand their presence, it is plausible that they would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.
- Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the TTPs and the context of the question is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
