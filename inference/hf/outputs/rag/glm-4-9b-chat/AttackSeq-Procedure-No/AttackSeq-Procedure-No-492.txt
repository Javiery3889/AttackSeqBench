Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon are likely to use the FTP protocol for command and control (C2) communication after the Harvester's custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols

T1113-Screen Capture is a technique used for collecting information from the target environment, which is consistent with the Harvester's custom screenshot tool capturing and archiving screenshots. T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols is a technique used for command and control communication, which is relevant to the second part of the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is asking about the use of the FTP protocol for C2 communication. The related TTPs suggest that there is a collection phase (T1113-Screen Capture) and a command and control phase (T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols). However, the TTPs do not specify which protocol is used for C2 communication.

FTP is one of the protocols that can be used for C2 communication, but it is not the only one. Other protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or even custom protocols might be used as well. The question is asking if it is "likely" that FTP will be used, which implies that we are looking for a common or typical choice among the possible protocols.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided do not specify the use of FTP for C2 communication.
- While FTP is a possible protocol for C2 communication, it is not the only one.
- The question asks if it is "likely" that FTP will be used, which suggests that we should consider the most common or typical choice among the possible protocols.

Final Answer: B: No

The answer is "No" because the TTPs do not provide enough information to conclude that FTP is the most likely protocol for C2 communication. There are other protocols that could be used, and without additional context, it is not plausible to assume that FTP is the most likely choice.
