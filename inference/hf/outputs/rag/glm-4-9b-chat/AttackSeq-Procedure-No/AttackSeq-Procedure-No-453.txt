Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether APT-TOCS, after using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control operations, is likely to exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement
  - Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
- Tactic: Execution
  - Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

The TTPs indicate that the attacker is engaging in lateral movement (T1570) and using PowerShell (T1059.001) for execution. Lateral movement is a tactic that involves moving laterally across a network to access other systems. T1570, Lateral Tool Transfer, is a technique that specifically refers to an attacker using tools that are already present on the network to move laterally. T1059.001 is the technique of using PowerShell for execution, which is consistent with the initial action of using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that after using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts, APT-TOCS is likely to exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network. This is plausible because lateral movement is a common behavior for attackers to maintain persistence and access more resources within a network.

B: No
- This answer suggests that APT-TOCS is not likely to exhibit lateral movement. However, given the TTPs provided, this seems less plausible because the T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer technique is specifically designed for lateral movement.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where PowerShell is used to download encrypted data scripts, which is a common method for execution (T1059.001).
- The related TTPs include lateral movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer), which is a technique used to move laterally across a network.
- Given that the attacker is already using a technique that is associated with lateral movement, it is reasonable to conclude that the attacker is likely to exhibit lateral movement within the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
