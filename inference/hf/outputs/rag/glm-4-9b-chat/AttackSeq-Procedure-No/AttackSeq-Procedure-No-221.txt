Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether a Shellbot, which has already established Command and Control (C&C) communication via an IRC channel, is likely to gather information about the infected host. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

The Tactic "Discovery" refers to the process of identifying and mapping the environment to understand the assets and vulnerabilities. The Technique "T1082-System Information Discovery" is a specific method within the Discovery Tactic that involves gathering information about the system, such as hardware and software configurations.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host after establishing C&C communication. This aligns with the Technique "T1082-System Information Discovery," which is a common step in the Discovery Tactic. Gathering system information is a typical action for a malware or bot that has successfully established a connection with its C&C server.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Shellbot is not likely to gather information about the infected host. However, this does not align with the common behavior of malware or bots that have established a C&C connection. Gathering system information is a standard action to understand the environment and prepare for further exploitation.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where a Shellbot has already established C&C communication, which is a significant milestone in an attack. 
- The related TTPs indicate that after establishing a connection, the next logical step is to gather information about the system, which is what T1082-System Information Discovery is for.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Shellbot would gather information about the infected host.

Final Answer: A: Yes
