Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Rising Sun implant, after performing initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is likely to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication

T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is a technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework that refers to the ability of an attacker to send and receive data from a compromised system to a C2 server. This technique is often used to maintain persistence on a network and to exfiltrate data.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Rising Sun implant is likely to use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication with its C2 server. While it is possible for an attacker to use unconventional channels for C2 communication, the use of blogs and WordPress is not a common or typical method. These platforms are generally not designed for secure, bidirectional communication between an implant and a C2 server.

B: No
- This answer suggests that it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant would use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. Given that blogs and WordPress are not typically used for secure C2 communication, this answer aligns more closely with the common practices of attackers who use more secure and stealthy methods for C2 communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the likelihood of the Rising Sun implant using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication after initial reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs indicate that the implant is engaging in Command and Control activities, which typically involve secure and stealthy communication methods.
- The use of blogs and WordPress for C2 communication is not a common or typical method, as these platforms are not designed for secure communication.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the context of the question is that the Rising Sun implant would not use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

Final Answer: B: No
