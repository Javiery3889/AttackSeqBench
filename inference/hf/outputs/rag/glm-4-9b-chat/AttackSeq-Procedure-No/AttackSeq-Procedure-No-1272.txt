Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that WastedLocker ransomware, after deploying using PsExec and performing Defense Evasion actions such as stopping services and disabling Windows Defender, will proceed to delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands during the Impact phase of the attack.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact
- Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery

T1490-Inhibit System Recovery is a technique within the MITRE ATT&CK framework that refers to actions taken by an attacker to prevent the recovery of data or systems. This technique is typically associated with the Impact phase of an attack, where the attacker aims to cause harm or disruption to the target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that it is likely that WastedLocker ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies during the Impact phase. Since T1490-Inhibit System Recovery is a technique that aligns with the Impact phase and involves actions to prevent system recovery, this answer is plausible.

B: No
- This answer suggests that it is not likely that WastedLocker ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies during the Impact phase. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no information that contradicts the idea that the ransomware would take such an action.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where WastedLocker ransomware has already performed Defense Evasion actions, which is consistent with the initial stages of an attack.
- The related TTP indicates that the Impact phase involves inhibiting system recovery, which is a plausible action for ransomware to take to ensure that the victim cannot recover their data.
- The T1490-Inhibit System Recovery technique is a direct match to the action of deleting system volume shadow copies, which is a common method to prevent recovery.
- There is no information provided that contradicts the idea that the ransomware would delete system volume shadow copies.

Final Answer: A: Yes
