Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that Tortoiseshell conducted pre-compromise web searches for victim information. The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes the execution of a reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' for discovery, followed by gaining initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a specific website.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery

These TTPs are related to the discovery and reconnaissance phases of an attack. T1016.001 refers to the discovery of internet connections, T1589.001 involves gathering credentials, and T1518 is about discovering software on a network.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question focuses on whether Tortoiseshell conducted web searches for victim information before the attack sequence described. The TTPs provided do not directly mention web searches. However, we can infer the following:

- The execution of 'bird.exe' for discovery (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery) suggests that Tortoiseshell was looking for information about the target's network infrastructure.
- The Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials implies that Tortoiseshell was gathering information about potential user credentials, which could be part of the reconnaissance process to understand the target's environment.
- The Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery indicates that Tortoiseshell was looking for software installed on the target's systems.

Given these TTPs, it is plausible that Tortoiseshell conducted web searches for victim information as part of the reconnaissance phase. Web searches could be a method to gather information about the target, such as employee details, system configurations, or potential vulnerabilities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. Tortoiseshell executed 'bird.exe' for discovery, which is a step that could involve gathering network information.
2. Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app, which suggests a social engineering attack.
3. The TTPs provided indicate a focus on discovery and reconnaissance, which are phases that often involve gathering information about the target.
4. While the TTPs do not explicitly mention web searches, they do suggest a comprehensive approach to gathering information about the target's environment.

Final Answer: A: Yes
