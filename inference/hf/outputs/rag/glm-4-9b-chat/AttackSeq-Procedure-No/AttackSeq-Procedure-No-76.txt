Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after gathering information about the infected computer, it is likely that the malware will perform specific actions, which include extracting emails from archived Outlook .pst files and transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery - This tactic involves identifying and collecting information about the environment, such as system and user names.
- Technique: T1087.003-Email Account - This technique refers to attempting to identify email accounts on the system.
- Tactic: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the system, such as files, documents, or emails.
- Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection - This technique refers to collecting emails from local email clients, such as Outlook.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question's scenario involves the following sequence of actions:
1. Gathering information about the infected computer (Discovery).
2. Extracting emails from archived Outlook .pst files (Collection).
3. Transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers (which could involve using an Email Account).

Given the related TTPs:
- The first action aligns with the Tactic: Discovery.
- The second action aligns with the Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection, as it involves collecting emails from a local email client.
- The third action is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is plausible that the attackers would use an email account to send the data, which could be related to the Technique: T1087.003-Email Account.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely the malware will perform the described actions.
Answer Choice B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely the malware will perform the described actions.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already gathered information about the infected computer, which aligns with the Tactic: Discovery.
2. The malware is now extracting emails from archived Outlook .pst files, which is a form of local email collection, aligning with the Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection.
3. The final step is to transmit the data through encrypted emails. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention encrypted emails, it is a plausible step in the context of a cyber attack and could involve using an email account, which is related to the Technique: T1087.003-Email Account.

Given the alignment of the actions with the provided TTPs and the plausible nature of the final step, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is likely to occur.

Final Answer: A: Yes
