Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Black Energy 2 malware will perform a specific sequence of actions: mount and bind to the `/proc/` filepath on the victim system, enable subsequent operation in memory, remove on-disk artifacts, evade defenses by encrypting its payload, and load plugins directly onto the infected machine.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.009-Proc Memory: This technique involves using the `/proc/` filesystem to store malicious code in memory, which can help in evading detection.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to avoid detection by security tools.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage: This technique involves storing malicious code in a way that it does not persist on disk, which can help in evading detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- T1055.009-Proc Memory is directly related to the question's mention of mounting and binding to the `/proc/` filepath for operation in memory.
- T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File is relevant to the question's mention of encrypting the payload to evade defenses.
- T1027.011-Fileless Storage is relevant to the question's mention of removing on-disk artifacts and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that none of the mentioned actions are likely to be performed by Black Energy 2, which contradicts the TTPs provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided suggest that Black Energy 2 is designed to use techniques that align with the actions described in the question.
- T1055.009-Proc Memory supports the operation in memory.
- T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File supports the evasion of defenses by encrypting the payload.
- T1027.011-Fileless Storage supports the removal of on-disk artifacts and the direct loading of plugins onto the infected machine.

Final Answer: A: Yes
