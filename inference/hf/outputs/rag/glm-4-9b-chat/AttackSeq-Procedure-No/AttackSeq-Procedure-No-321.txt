Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether an app that uploads files via FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) operations is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control. This technique is often used because web protocols are commonly allowed through firewalls and are less likely to be blocked by security systems.

T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol refers to the exfiltration of data over a protocol that is not specifically designed for command and control. This technique is used when the attacker wants to avoid detection by using less common or unmonitored protocols.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the app would send the information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. This is plausible because HTTP is a common protocol for exfiltration, and it is often used for data transmission due to its widespread acceptance and the fact that it can be used to exfiltrate data without raising suspicion.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the app would not send the information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. This is less plausible given the TTPs provided. The use of HTTP for exfiltration is a common technique, and there is no indication that the app would switch to a different protocol after performing routines on the iOS device.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question involves an app that uses FTP for C2 operations, which is a web protocol (T1071.001).
- The exfiltration technique (T1048.003) suggests that the attacker might use a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration.
- Given that HTTP is a common and widely used protocol for exfiltration, it is likely that the app would continue to use HTTP for exfiltration after performing routines on the iOS device.

Final Answer: A: Yes
