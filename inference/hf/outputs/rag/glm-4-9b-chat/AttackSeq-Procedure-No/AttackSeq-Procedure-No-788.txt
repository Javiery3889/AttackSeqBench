Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious links that lead to the initial compromise.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain: This technique refers to attackers compromising the software supply chain to distribute malicious software, such as by tampering with legitimate software updates.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests a sequence of events where the Higaisa APT group first distributes malicious LNK files via spear-phishing (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) and then attempts to compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor. The related TTPs indicate that the group has the capability to compromise software supply chains (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain).

Given the sequence of events described in the question and the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely the Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. This aligns with the TTPs provided, as the group has the capability to compromise software supply chains (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain).

B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely the Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. This contradicts the TTPs provided, as the group has the capability to compromise software supply chains.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of events where the Higaisa APT group uses spear-phishing to distribute malicious LNK files and then attempts to compromise legitimate web browser updates.
- The related TTPs indicate that the group has the capability to compromise software supply chains, which aligns with the second part of the described attack sequence.
- Based on the TTPs and the sequence of events, it is plausible that the Higaisa APT group would use their capabilities to compromise legitimate web browser updates after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.

Final Answer: A: Yes
