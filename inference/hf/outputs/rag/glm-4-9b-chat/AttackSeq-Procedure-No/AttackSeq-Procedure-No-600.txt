Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase after they have launched campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks is a technique used for reconnaissance to identify potential targets by scanning IP blocks. T1046-Network Service Discovery is a technique used during the Discovery phase to identify services running on a network. T1059.005-Visual Basic is a technique used for Execution, which involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros to deliver malware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the Sednit group has already established initial access using malicious documents with VBA macros, which corresponds to the Execution phase (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic). The next phase mentioned is Discovery, which is where the group would likely gather information about the target environment.

Given the TTPs provided, the Sednit group's next steps after Execution would be to gather information about the target network, which aligns with the Tactic: Discovery. Within this tactic, T1046-Network Service Discovery is a relevant technique for identifying services running on the network. However, the question specifically mentions targeting IP ranges for vulnerability scanning, which is more closely aligned with T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks.

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Sednit group would use T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks as part of their Discovery phase after establishing initial access with malicious documents containing VBA macros.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Sednit group has established initial access using malicious documents with VBA macros, which is an Execution phase activity (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
2. The next phase mentioned is Discovery, which is where the group would gather information about the target environment.
3. The related TTPs suggest that the group would use T1046-Network Service Discovery during the Discovery phase.
4. However, the question specifically asks about targeting IP ranges for vulnerability scanning, which is more closely aligned with T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the Sednit group would use T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks during the Discovery phase after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros.

Final Answer: A: Yes
