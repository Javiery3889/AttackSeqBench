Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after a series of steps have been completed. These steps include:
- Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.
- Exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

T1190 refers to the exploitation of public-facing applications, which could include the zero-day vulnerabilities mentioned in the question. T1068 refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, which is also mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Stager module will only notify after all the steps have been completed. Given that the TTPs provided are related to the steps of the attack sequence, this answer is plausible.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Stager module will notify at any point during the attack sequence. However, the question specifically mentions that the notification is only after all the steps have been completed. The TTPs provided do not indicate that the Stager module would notify at any point before the final steps.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific sequence of events that must be completed before a notification is made.
- The TTPs provided are directly related to the steps in the question, including the exploitation of vulnerabilities and privilege escalation.
- Based on the information given, the most plausible sequence is that the Stager module will only notify after all the steps have been completed.

Final Answer: A: Yes
