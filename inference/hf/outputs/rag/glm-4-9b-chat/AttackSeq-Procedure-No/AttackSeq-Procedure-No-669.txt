Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that adversaries, after identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase, would then use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure: This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used for command and control.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery: This technique is about discovering containers and resources within a network.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question focuses on the Reconnaissance phase, which is about gathering information about the target environment. The TTPs provided are relevant to the Reconnaissance phase, and we need to determine if scanning entire netblocks and detecting compromised Docker APIs is a plausible activity during this phase.

- T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks: This technique is directly related to scanning IP blocks, which could be part of the Reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets. However, it does not specifically mention Docker APIs.
- T1665-Hide Infrastructure: This technique is about hiding infrastructure and is not directly related to scanning or detecting compromised Docker APIs.
- T1613-Container and Resource Discovery: This technique is specifically about discovering containers and resources, which includes Docker APIs. This is the most relevant TTP to the question.

Given the context of the question, the use of DOCKERGEDDON, which is a tool designed to scan for Docker vulnerabilities, would be most aligned with the T1613-Container and Resource Discovery technique.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question is about the Reconnaissance phase, which involves gathering information about the target environment.
2. The TTPs provided are relevant to the Reconnaissance phase.
3. T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks is a plausible technique but does not specifically mention Docker APIs.
4. T1665-Hide Infrastructure is not directly related to scanning or detecting Docker APIs.
5. T1613-Container and Resource Discovery is the most relevant TTP as it includes discovering Docker APIs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
