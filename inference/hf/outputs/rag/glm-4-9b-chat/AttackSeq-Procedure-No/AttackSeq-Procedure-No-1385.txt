Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether FIN13, after using passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries. The question is essentially asking if the attackers will use web shells and custom malware for initial access after establishing persistence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

These TTPs are relevant because they describe common methods used in cyber attacks. T1071.001 refers to the use of web protocols for command and control, T1505.003 refers to the use of web shells for persistence, and T1104 refers to the use of multi-stage channels for command and control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that after using BLUEAGAVE and other persistence methods, FIN13 will use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access. This is plausible because web shells and custom malware can be used for initial access, and the TTPs provided include the use of web shells (T1505.003) and multi-stage channels (T1104), which could be used to deploy such malware.

B: No
- This answer suggests that FIN13 will not use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access after establishing persistence. This is less plausible because the TTPs provided include the use of web shells for persistence, which implies that they are likely to use them for some form of access.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where FIN13 has already established persistence using BLUEAGAVE and other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
- The TTPs provided include the use of web shells (T1505.003) and multi-stage channels (T1104), which are techniques that could be used to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
- Given that web shells are a common method for persistence and initial access, it is plausible that FIN13 would use them after establishing persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
