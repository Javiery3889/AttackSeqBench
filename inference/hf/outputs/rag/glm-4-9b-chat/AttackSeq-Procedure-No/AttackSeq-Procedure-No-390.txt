Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that after using AtomBombing to inject malicious code into legitimate programs, threat actors will use a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

T1221-Template Injection is a technique that involves using a template to inject malicious code into a document or file. This is relevant because it suggests that the threat actors are already using methods to inject code into files, which aligns with the use of AtomBombing.

T1059.005-Visual Basic is a technique that involves using Visual Basic for Applications to execute code. This is also relevant because it directly mentions the use of VBA, which is a scripting language that can be embedded within documents like Word.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- The use of VBA scripts is a common method for delivering malicious code within documents, such as Word documents. Given that the threat actors have already used a method (AtomBombing) to inject code into legitimate programs, it is plausible that they would use another method (embedding a VBA script) to further evade defenses and execute code.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the threat actors would not use a VBA script. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no indication that they would not use VBA, as it is a common technique for delivering malicious code within documents.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where threat actors have already used AtomBombing, which is a method of code injection. The related TTPs include techniques that involve injecting code into documents (T1221-Template Injection) and using VBA (T1059.005-Visual Basic) to execute code.
- Since the TTPs suggest that the threat actors are already using methods to inject code into files and have knowledge of VBA, it is reasonable to conclude that they would use a VBA script as part of their strategy.
- Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
