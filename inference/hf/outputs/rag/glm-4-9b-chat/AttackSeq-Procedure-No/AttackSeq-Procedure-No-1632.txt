Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether an adversary, after compressing and encrypting large chunks of data and staging them for exfiltration, would divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (1,048,576 bytes) or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint: This technique refers to the collection of data from SharePoint Online. It does not directly address the size of the files or the need to divide them.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits: This technique involves the transfer of data with size limitations. It is relevant to the question as it could influence the decision to divide files if they exceed a certain size.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the adversary would divide files if they are 0x1000000 bytes or more.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the adversary would not divide files if they are 0x1000000 bytes or more.

The related TTPs indicate that the size of the data transfer is a concern, which is why the technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits is relevant. This technique is likely to be a factor in the decision to divide files if they exceed a certain size to avoid exceeding data transfer limits.

When considering the context of the question, it is plausible that if the data size is 0x1000000 bytes or more, the adversary would divide the files to ensure that the data transfer does not exceed the size limits of the data transfer technique (T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits). This is especially true if the data transfer method has strict size constraints, which is common in many network environments to prevent denial-of-service attacks or to comply with network policies.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question involves the collection phase of an attack, where data is being collected from a SharePoint Online repository.
2. The data is compressed and encrypted, which does not inherently require division of files.
3. The technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits is relevant to the exfiltration phase, which is the next step after collection.
4. Given that the data is large (0x1000000 bytes or more), it is likely that the adversary would need to consider the data transfer size limits.
5. Dividing the files into smaller chunks would allow the adversary to stay within the size limits of the data transfer technique.

Final Answer: A: Yes
