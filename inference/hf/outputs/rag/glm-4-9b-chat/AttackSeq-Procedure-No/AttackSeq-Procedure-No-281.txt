Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the OceanLotus backdoor, after establishing command and control (C2) communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode, is likely to perform a specific action: survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
  - Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and hardware configuration.
- Tactic: Command and Control
  - Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography: This technique refers to the use of symmetric encryption for command and control communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question's context involves the OceanLotus backdoor, which is a known piece of malware associated with the OceanLotus threat group. Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to perform system information discovery after establishing C2 communication. The TTPs provided include a technique for system information discovery (T1082), which supports this answer choice.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor is not likely to perform system information discovery after establishing C2 communication. However, the TTPs provided do not contradict this action; they only describe the encryption used for C2 communication (T1573.001), which is not directly related to the action of gathering system information.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to perform system information discovery after establishing C2 communication.
- The TTPs provided include a technique for system information discovery (T1082), which is relevant to the action described in the question.
- The TTPs also include a technique for symmetric cryptography (T1573.001), which is related to the encryption of C2 communication but does not directly address the action of gathering system information.
- Based on the provided TTPs, there is no information that contradicts the action of gathering system information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
