Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that proxy servers will be used within the infrastructure of a threat actor (RIG EK) after they have used a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encrypted command and control (C2) operations. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using proxy servers to route network traffic to hide the source and destination of the communication.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography: This technique involves using symmetric encryption to secure communications between the attacker and the compromised system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

A: Yes
- The use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encrypted C2 operations suggests that RIG EK is interested in maintaining a secure and stealthy communication channel. Using proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) would be a plausible step to further obfuscate the communication and make infections harder to detect. This aligns with the TTPs provided.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that RIG EK does not use additional measures to hide their C2 operations after using RC4 encryption. However, given the nature of cyber threats and the need for stealth, it is unlikely that an attacker would stop at using encryption without also using other methods to hide their activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question indicates that RIG EK is using a custom RC4 algorithm for encrypted C2 operations, which is a technique to secure communications.
- The related TTPs suggest that proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) are a technique used to route network traffic to hide the source and destination of communications, which is consistent with the goal of making infections harder to detect.
- The use of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) is also mentioned, which is relevant to the encryption technique used, but it does not directly address the use of proxy servers.
- Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that RIG EK would likely use proxy servers to further obfuscate their C2 operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
