Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor, which was delivered through a supply-chain attack, will use domain fronting to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting

T1071.004-DNS refers to the use of DNS to communicate with a C2 server, which is a common method for command and control activities.
T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain is the technique used to initially gain access to the target system, which is the context of the Sunburst backdoor.
T1090.004-Domain Fronting is a technique used to disguise the destination of network traffic by routing it through a legitimate domain.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the Sunburst backdoor and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- The Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated malware that was delivered through a supply-chain attack. It is common for such malware to use advanced techniques to communicate with its C2 server. Domain fronting is an advanced technique that can be used to disguise the destination of network traffic, making it a plausible method for the Sunburst backdoor to use.

B: No
- While it is not guaranteed that the Sunburst backdoor would use domain fronting, the fact that it is a sophisticated piece of malware delivered through a supply-chain attack suggests that it is likely to use advanced techniques to communicate with its C2 server. Without specific information indicating that it does not use domain fronting, we cannot definitively say "No."

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Step 1: The Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated malware that was delivered through a supply-chain attack.
Step 2: The related TTPs suggest that the malware is designed for command and control activities and may use advanced techniques like DNS communication and domain fronting.
Step 3: Given the context and the nature of the malware, it is plausible that the Sunburst backdoor would use domain fronting to communicate with its C2 server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
