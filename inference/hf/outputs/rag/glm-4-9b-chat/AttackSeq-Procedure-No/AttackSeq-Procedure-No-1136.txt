Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of fake social media personas to gather information, followed by the use of social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents. The question then asks if it is likely that the WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.001-Social Media

These TTPs are related to the use of social media for reconnaissance and resource development. T1585.001 and T1586.001 are techniques for using social media accounts for resource development, while T1593.001 is a technique for reconnaissance using social media.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question's scenario involves the APT using social media for reconnaissance, which is a clear indication of the Reconnaissance Tactic. The APT has already gathered information and stolen data from social media mobile apps. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to use this information for further development of the target.

The TTPs provided suggest that the APT is already engaged in Resource Development (Tactic) by using social media accounts. This aligns with the idea that the APT is building a profile of the target. Given that the APT has already gathered contact lists, emails, and SMS contents, it is plausible that they would use this information to access external victim-owned websites for further target development.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely the APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development after the described reconnaissance activities.

Answer Choice B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely the APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development after the described reconnaissance activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The APT has already engaged in reconnaissance using social media, which is a technique for gathering information about the target.
- The APT has gathered contact lists, emails, and SMS contents, which are valuable pieces of information for further target development.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the APT is already involved in resource development, which is consistent with the idea of using the gathered information for further target development.
- Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the APT would use this information to access external victim-owned websites for target development.

Final Answer: A: Yes
