Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the SBDH malware, after employing filters to collect targeted data, will incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding for network communication with its Command and Control (C&C) server. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1001.001-Junk Data
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1205.002-Socket Filters

The TTPs indicate that the malware is using Command and Control tactics and employs two specific techniques: using junk data (T1001.001) and socket filters (T1205.002).

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically mentions the use of junk data in encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding. The related TTP, T1001.001-Junk Data, directly addresses this aspect. The other TTP, T1205.002-Socket Filters, is related to filtering network traffic but does not directly address the use of junk data in encoded strings.

Given that the question is focused on the incorporation of junk data into encoded strings, the TTP T1001.001-Junk Data is the most relevant to the question.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer suggests that the malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings.
Answer Choice B: No - This answer suggests that the malware will not incorporate junk data into encoded strings.

Since the TTP T1001.001-Junk Data is directly related to the question and there is no information provided that contradicts the use of junk data, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would use this technique.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the use of junk data in encoded strings for network communication with the C&C server.
- The related TTP T1001.001-Junk Data is directly related to the use of junk data.
- The other TTP, T1205.002-Socket Filters, is not directly related to the use of junk data in encoded strings.
- Therefore, based on the provided TTPs, it is plausible that the malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings.

Final Answer: A: Yes
