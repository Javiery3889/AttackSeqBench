Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that the Poison Ivy server, which has been delivered via social engineering as mobile code, will use Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications with the attacker's client during the C2 phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- Tactic: Execution - Technique: T1204-User Execution: This TTP indicates that the malware is executed by a user, which is consistent with the social engineering method mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Command and Control - Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication: This TTP suggests that the malware is capable of bidirectional communication, which is a common characteristic of C2 operations.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that Google Drive is used for C2 communications. Given that the malware is capable of bidirectional communication (T1102.002), it is plausible that it could use Google Drive, which is a cloud storage service that supports file sharing and can be used for C2 purposes.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Google Drive is not used for C2 communications. However, there is no information provided that explicitly states that Google Drive is not used, and it is a common and plausible choice for C2 due to its widespread use and the ability to share files and communicate.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the delivery of Poison Ivy as mobile code via social engineering, which aligns with the T1204-User Execution TTP.
- The question also mentions the Command and Control phase, which is associated with the T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication TTP.
- Google Drive is a plausible platform for C2 communications due to its file-sharing capabilities and widespread use.
- There is no information provided that contradicts the use of Google Drive for C2 communications.

Final Answer: A: Yes
