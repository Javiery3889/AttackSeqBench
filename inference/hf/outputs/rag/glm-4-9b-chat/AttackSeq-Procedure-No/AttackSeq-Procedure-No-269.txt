Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Korplug variant of a malware will communicate with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and only before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by malware to avoid detection and to blend in with legitimate web traffic.

T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of non-standard protocols for command and control communication. This technique is used to evade detection by security systems that monitor standard protocols.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Korplug variant will use a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communication, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and will only do so before collecting data from various sources.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Korplug variant will not use a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communication, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and will not do so before collecting data from various sources.

Given the TTPs provided, T1071.001-Web Protocols indicates that the malware might use web protocols, which could include HTTPS, for command and control. T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol suggests that the malware might use a non-standard protocol, which could be a custom TCP-based protocol. The sequence of actions described in the question (handshake, data collection) is plausible given these techniques.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that align with the use of web protocols (T1071.001) and non-standard protocols (T1095).
- The sequence involves a handshake, which could be over HTTPS or TCP, followed by data collection from various sources.
- The use of a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communication is consistent with the TTPs provided, as it suggests the use of non-standard protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
