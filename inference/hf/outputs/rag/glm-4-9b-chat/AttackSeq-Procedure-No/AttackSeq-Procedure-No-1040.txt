Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that attackers who have exploited a specific Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word will create a scheduled task to establish persistence before deploying a PowerShell backdoor (POWERSHOWER). The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution refers to the exploitation of client-side software vulnerabilities to execute code on the target system. CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows for remote code execution, which aligns with this technique.

T1053.005-Scheduled Task is a technique used by attackers to establish persistence on a system by creating a scheduled task that will run malicious code at a later time. This is a common method for attackers to maintain a presence on a compromised system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely the attackers will create a scheduled task to establish persistence. Since T1053.005-Scheduled Task is a common persistence technique, this answer is plausible.

B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely the attackers will create a scheduled task. However, given the common use of persistence techniques in cyber attacks, this answer is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already exploited a client-side vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access, which is a technique that falls under T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
- Establishing persistence is a common step in a cyber attack to maintain access to the compromised system.
- T1053.005-Scheduled Task is a well-known persistence technique that aligns with the need for attackers to maintain access after initial exploitation.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the attackers would likely create a scheduled task to establish persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
