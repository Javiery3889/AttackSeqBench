Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion. The key elements here are the use of "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts, the remote control of targeted systems, and the use of multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

T1059.001 refers to the use of PowerShell for lateral movement within a network. This technique is often used by attackers to execute scripts and commands on a system without leaving a trace, which is consistent with the use of "powershell.exe" in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers used multi-beacon communication for defense evasion. This implies that the multi-beacon communication was a prerequisite for executing the Shellcode in memory.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory at the core step of the attack, regardless of whether multi-beacon communication was used for defense evasion.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the attackers would use multi-beacon communication to evade detection and then execute the Shellcode in memory. PowerShell is a common tool for attackers to achieve this kind of lateral movement and command execution.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS uses "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
- The use of PowerShell (T1059.001) is a technique that aligns with the described attack method.
- The question also mentions multi-beacon communication for defense evasion, which is a method to avoid detection and is often used in conjunction with lateral movement techniques like PowerShell.
- Given that the use of PowerShell is a common method for lateral movement and the context of defense evasion, it is reasonable to assume that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
