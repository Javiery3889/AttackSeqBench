Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the malware, after establishing network communication with its C&C server and setting up a secure communication channel, will use command-line arguments to communicate with the C&C server or listen on a TCP socket for incoming connections.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used to blend in with legitimate web traffic, which could involve using HTTP or HTTPS.

T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol involves using non-standard protocols for command and control, which could include TCP, UDP, or other protocols that are not typically used for web traffic.

T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is a technique where the malware can both send and receive data from the C&C server, which is a common characteristic of persistent and interactive command and control channels.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the TTPs provided, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This suggests that the malware will use command-line arguments to establish communication with the C&C server. This is less likely given the TTPs provided, as command-line arguments are not mentioned in the context of the TTPs.

B: No - This suggests that the malware will not use command-line arguments but instead will listen on a TCP socket for incoming connections. This is more aligned with the TTPs provided, as T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication both imply that the malware is set up to listen for incoming connections, which is a characteristic of a TCP socket.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the method of communication after establishing a secure channel.
- The TTPs provided indicate the use of web protocols, non-standard protocols, and bidirectional communication.
- None of the TTPs mention the use of command-line arguments.
- The TTPs suggest the use of network sockets for communication, which is consistent with listening on a TCP socket.

Final Answer: B: No
