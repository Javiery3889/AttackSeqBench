Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether heap spraying techniques were likely used before malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal. The goal of the attackers was to redirect victims to an exploit landing page that exploited CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome. The question is specifically about the use of heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute an embedded shellcode payload.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript

T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a technique where a user is compromised by an attacker without any action on their part, such as clicking on a malicious link or visiting a compromised website. T1059.007-JavaScript is a technique that involves the use of JavaScript to execute code on a target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
Heap spraying is a technique that involves overwriting a large portion of a program's heap memory with a malicious payload, which can then be executed. This technique is often used to exploit vulnerabilities in browsers or other software that rely on heap memory. Since the malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a news portal to exploit CVE-2019-13720, which is a vulnerability in Google Chrome, it is plausible that heap spraying was used to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute the embedded shellcode payload.

B: No
This answer choice suggests that heap spraying was not used. However, given the nature of the attack (exploiting a browser vulnerability through JavaScript code), it is reasonable to consider that heap spraying could have been a part of the attack to ensure the payload was executed successfully.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack involved inserting malicious JavaScript code into a news portal.
2. The goal was to redirect victims to an exploit landing page that exploited CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
3. Heap spraying is a technique that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in browsers, such as the one in question.
4. Given the nature of the attack and the use of JavaScript, it is plausible that heap spraying was used to ensure the payload was executed.

Final Answer: A: Yes
