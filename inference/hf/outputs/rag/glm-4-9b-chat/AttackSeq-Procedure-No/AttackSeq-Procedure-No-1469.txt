Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are all related to the "Discovery" tactic, which is the initial phase of an attack where an attacker gathers information about the target environment. The specific techniques mentioned are:
- T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique involves identifying and enumerating remote systems on a network.
- T1049-System Network Connections Discovery: This technique is used to identify and enumerate system network connections.
- T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks: This technique involves monitoring user activity to identify potential malicious behavior.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) will establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. This would be consistent with the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker would first gather information about the target network and systems, including potential entry points for the implant.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) will not establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. This would imply that the communication with C2 servers is part of the post-installation phase, which is less likely given the nature of the initial reconnaissance phase.

The related TTPs all pertain to the discovery phase, which is the time when an attacker would be gathering information about the target environment. It is plausible that an attacker would use this phase to identify potential entry points and establish communication with C2 servers before deploying the implant.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the sequence of actions taken by an attacker using BlackEnergy 3.
- The related TTPs are all related to the discovery phase, which is the initial phase of an attack.
- Given that the discovery phase is about gathering information and identifying potential entry points, it is reasonable to assume that an attacker would establish communication with C2 servers during this phase.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malicious implant would establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
