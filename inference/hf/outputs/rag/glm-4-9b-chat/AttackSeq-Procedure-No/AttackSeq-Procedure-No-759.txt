Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether attackers, after verifying victims' credentials and prompting for a 2-step verification code, will switch to using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. This question is focused on the attackers' tactics and techniques to bypass security measures.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spearphishing emails to gain initial access to a target's system.
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts: This technique involves developing resources, such as email accounts, to support the attack.
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves reconnaissance using spearphishing links to gather information about the target.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is asking about the use of images in phishing emails to evade security systems. Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the attackers will use images in phishing emails. However, the provided TTPs do not directly mention the use of images in phishing emails. The TTPs are focused on initial access, resource development, and reconnaissance, not specifically on the content of the phishing emails.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the attackers will not use images in phishing emails. The TTPs provided do not indicate any specific technique that involves using images in phishing emails. The focus is on gaining access and developing resources, not on the content of the emails.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the use of images in phishing emails, which is not directly addressed by the provided TTPs.
- The TTPs are related to initial access, resource development, and reconnaissance, which are not directly related to the content of phishing emails.
- Since the TTPs do not provide any information about the use of images in phishing emails, we cannot conclude that the attackers will use images based on the given information.

Final Answer: B: No
