Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether APT28, a known cyber threat actor, is likely to install and execute a VBA script (like vba_macro.exe) to drop malware (such as FONTCACHE.DAT) after gaining initial access through spear-phishing campaigns. The follow-up question is whether the group will use tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE during their operations.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

T1070.004-File Deletion is a technique used to delete files that could be used for analysis or to prevent the analysis of the system. This is a common technique for defense evasion.

T1059.005-Visual Basic is a technique that involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripts, which can be used to execute code and potentially drop malware on a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question:

A: Yes
- APT28 is known for using spear-phishing campaigns to deliver exploit documents, which can contain VBA macros. The TTP T1059.005-Visual Basic suggests that the group is likely to use VBA scripts to execute code and drop malware. The TTP T1070.004-File Deletion could be used to delete files that could hinder analysis, which is consistent with the behavior of an advanced persistent threat actor like APT28. Therefore, it is plausible that APT28 would use a VBA script to drop malware after initial access.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that APT28 would not use a VBA script to drop malware. However, given the TTPs provided and the known behavior of APT28, this answer is less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT28 is known to use spear-phishing campaigns, which can deliver exploit documents containing VBA macros.
- The TTP T1059.005-Visual Basic indicates that the group is likely to use VBA scripts to execute code and drop malware.
- The TTP T1070.004-File Deletion is consistent with the behavior of an advanced persistent threat actor like APT28, who would likely take steps to evade detection and analysis.
- Based on the provided TTPs and the known tactics of APT28, it is reasonable to conclude that the group would install and execute a VBA script to drop malware after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
