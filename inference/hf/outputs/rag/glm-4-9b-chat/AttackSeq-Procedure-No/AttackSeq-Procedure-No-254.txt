Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether NanHaiShu, after gathering system information, is likely to create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts before executing JScript and VBScript code. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript

T1090.001-Internal Proxy refers to the use of an internal proxy to facilitate command and control communication between compromised systems. T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is the technique of gathering information about the network configuration of a system. T1059.007-JavaScript is the technique of executing JavaScript code.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- NanHaiShu gathers system information (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery).
- It is likely to establish a command and control channel (T1090.001-Internal Proxy).
- It downloads and executes JScript and VBScript code (T1059.007-JavaScript).

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that NanHaiShu does not create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies before executing the scripts.

Given the sequence of TTPs, it is plausible that NanHaiShu would create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies to establish a command and control channel before executing the JScript and VBScript code. The TTPs provided suggest a progression from discovery to command and control to execution, which aligns with the steps in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- NanHaiShu gathers system information, which is a discovery phase activity (T1016).
- It is likely to establish a command and control channel, which is a command and control phase activity (T1090.001).
- It then executes JScript and VBScript code, which is an execution phase activity (T1059.007).

The sequence of TTPs provided supports the idea that NanHaiShu would create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies before executing the scripts. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that NanHaiShu would create the proxies.

Final Answer: A: Yes
