Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Regin, a sophisticated malware, is likely to set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts after performing certain discovery activities. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule

T1040-Network Sniffing is a technique used to intercept and monitor data as it travels over a network. This is a common step in the discovery phase to gather information about the network and its traffic.

T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule is a technique used to set up rules on email accounts to automatically forward incoming messages to another email address. This is a collection technique, which is typically used to gather information or data from the victim's environment.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question's scenario involves the discovery phase, which is a precursor to the collection phase. The related TTPs suggest that after discovering network information (T1040-Network Sniffing), the next logical step would be to collect data from the network, which is what T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule does.

Given that Regin is a malware that is known for its sophisticated and targeted nature, it is plausible that it would set up auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic as part of its collection phase. This is because email accounts can be a valuable source of information for attackers, and setting up auto-forward rules would allow them to continuously monitor the victim's communications without having to manually check the email account.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the discovery phase, which is followed by the collection phase.
- The related TTPs indicate that after network discovery (T1040-Network Sniffing), the next step is to collect data (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule).
- Regin is known for its targeted and sophisticated behavior, which would include collecting data from email accounts to monitor network traffic.
- Therefore, it is plausible that Regin would set up auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files.

Final Answer: A: Yes
