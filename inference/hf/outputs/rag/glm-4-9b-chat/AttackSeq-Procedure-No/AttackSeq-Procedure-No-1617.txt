Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Regin, a sophisticated malware, is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase of an attack. The discovery phase is typically when an attacker is mapping out the target environment to understand its structure and potential vulnerabilities.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing: This technique involves intercepting and inspecting data in transit, which can be used to gather information about network traffic.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique is used to gather information about the system, such as installed software, hardware, and configuration details.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique is used to enumerate running processes on a system to understand the current activity and potential vulnerabilities.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Yes
- Regin is known for its stealthy and sophisticated behavior. It is plausible that Regin would use network sniffing (T1040) to gather information about network traffic, which could include information on processes and memory utilization. It is also likely that Regin would use system information discovery (T1082) to gather information on the system itself, including processes and memory utilization. Scanning for deleted files (T1057) is also a plausible action during the discovery phase to uncover deleted data that might still be recoverable.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that Regin would not gather information on processes and memory utilization or scan for deleted files during the discovery phase. However, given the nature of Regin and the TTPs provided, this seems less plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Regin is a malware that is designed to be stealthy and gather as much information as possible about the target environment.
- The TTPs provided indicate that Regin would likely use network sniffing to gather information about network traffic, system information discovery to gather information about the system itself, and process discovery to enumerate running processes.
- Scanning for deleted files is also a plausible action during the discovery phase to uncover deleted data that might still be recoverable.

Final Answer: A: Yes
