Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Agrius, a threat actor, is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and the 'DEADWOOD' malware before using 'IPsec Helper' to send recon information or download files. The context here is about the sequence of actions taken by the threat actor and whether the data destruction activities (wiping and overwriting files) occur before the reconnaissance and file download activities.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction: This indicates that the threat actor is attempting to cause harm or disruption to the target's data or systems.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion: This suggests that the threat actor is trying to evade detection by deleting files that might be used for analysis or that could impede the attack.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are both associated with data destruction (T1485-Data Destruction). If the threat actor is engaged in data destruction activities, it is plausible that they would deploy these tools before engaging in activities that could lead to further data exposure (such as sending recon information or downloading files).

B: No
- The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are indeed associated with data destruction. However, the question specifically asks if these actions occur before the 'IPsec Helper' is used for sending recon information or downloading files. The TTPs provided do not indicate that these data destruction activities are a prerequisite for the reconnaissance and file download activities. It is possible that the threat actor could perform reconnaissance and file download activities without prior data destruction.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs suggest that Agrius is engaged in data destruction activities, which could include deploying the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware.
- However, the TTPs do not provide a clear sequence that indicates these data destruction activities must occur before the 'IPsec Helper' is used for reconnaissance or file download.
- Therefore, while it is plausible that Agrius could deploy the wiper and malware before the 'IPsec Helper' activities, it is not necessarily a requirement based on the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
