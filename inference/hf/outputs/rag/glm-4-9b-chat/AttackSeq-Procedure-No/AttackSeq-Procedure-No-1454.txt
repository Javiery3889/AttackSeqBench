Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that an adversary, who has already sent emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT during the Initial Access phase, will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware

T1059.010 refers to the use of AutoHotKey and AutoIT, which are scripting languages that can be used to automate tasks on a system. This technique is often associated with the Execution phase of an attack, as it can be used to deploy or execute malicious payloads.

T1587.001 refers to the use of malware, which is a common technique during the Resource Development phase. This phase is where an attacker typically establishes a presence on the target network, collects information, and prepares for further exploitation.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question is specifically about the Resource Development phase, which is where the adversary would be looking to establish a presence and gather resources. Given that the related TTPs include the use of malware (T1587.001), it is plausible that the adversary would use custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor during this phase.

The fact that the adversary has already used a PDF link to deliver ENVYSCOUT, which is a known malware, suggests that they are already familiar with and comfortable using malware in their attacks. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would continue to use malware, including custom ones, during the Resource Development phase.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely the adversary will use custom malware during the Resource Development phase.
Answer Choice B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely the adversary will use custom malware during the Resource Development phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The adversary has already used a known malware (ENVYSCOUT) during the Initial Access phase.
- The use of malware is a common technique during the Resource Development phase.
- The related TTPs indicate that the adversary is familiar with using malware.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
