Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing. The question implies that the sequence of actions includes lateral movement across the victim network using WMI, followed by credential access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence on the network.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory: This technique involves accessing credentials by memory dumping the LSASS process.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of actions in the question can be broken down as follows:
1. Lateral movement across the victim network using WMI.
2. Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS.
3. Network sniffing.
4. Gathering information on user accounts using native OS binaries and scripts.

Given the TTPs provided:
- Tactic: Persistence (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question. It is more about maintaining access rather than the sequence of actions.
- Tactic: Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) is directly related to the second action in the sequence, which is gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS.

The question asks if the use of native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts is likely to occur after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing. The sequence of actions does not necessarily imply that the gathering of information on user accounts is dependent on the previous steps. It is possible that FIN13 could use native OS binaries and scripts at any point during the attack, not just after gaining credentials.

Final Answer: B: No

The reasoning is that the sequence of actions does not explicitly state that the use of native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts is contingent on the previous steps of gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing. Therefore, it is not plausible to conclude that this is the case based on the information provided.
