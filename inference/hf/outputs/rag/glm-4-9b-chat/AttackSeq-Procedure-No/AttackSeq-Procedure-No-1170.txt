Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that after gaining initial access through exploiting vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files (which is a form of spearphishing), ProjectM actors would use OpenSSL to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic before delivering payloads with the Andromeda Trojan.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

The TTPs suggest that the actors are likely to engage in activities related to command and control, defense evasion, and initial access. Specifically, the use of asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) and encrypted/encoded files (T1027.013) are mentioned, which are relevant to the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The use of asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) is a technique that could be used to encrypt C2 traffic. This suggests that the actors might use OpenSSL, which is a common tool for implementing encryption, to encrypt their C2 traffic.

B: No
- This answer choice would imply that the actors do not use encryption for their C2 traffic, which contradicts the TTP that mentions the use of asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is achieved through spearphishing, which is a common method for attackers to gain entry into a network.
- The actors are likely to establish command and control (C2) communication, which is a standard step in many attack sequences.
- The TTP related to asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) suggests that the actors are likely to use encryption for their C2 traffic.
- OpenSSL is a widely used tool for implementing encryption, which aligns with the TTP of using asymmetric cryptography.

Final Answer: A: Yes
