Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that RIG EK's exploit server will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same CDN for its command and control operations after using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1090-Proxy (Using proxy servers within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect)
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting (Using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically mentions the use of proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) and asks if domain fronting (T1090.004-Domain Fronting) is likely to be used after that. Given that both TTPs are related to the Command and Control tactic, we can infer that they are part of a broader strategy to obfuscate the command and control traffic.

Proxy servers are used to mask the source of the traffic, and domain fronting is a technique that takes this a step further by making the traffic appear to be legitimate traffic to a third-party service, such as a CDN. This is a common progression in the evolution of an attacker's tactics, as they look for more sophisticated ways to avoid detection.

Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that if an attacker is already using proxy servers, they might also use domain fronting to further obfuscate their command and control operations.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the use of proxy servers, which is a technique to make infections harder to detect.
2. The related TTPs include the use of domain fronting, which is a technique to disguise the destination of network traffic.
3. The use of domain fronting is a logical progression from using proxy servers, as both are methods to obfuscate command and control traffic.
4. Therefore, it is plausible that RIG EK's exploit server would use domain fronting after using proxy servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
