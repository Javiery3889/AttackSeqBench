Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Agrius, a threat actor, is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers. The context is about the deployment of CaddyWiper as part of data destruction activities, specifically targeting files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities, along with mapped drives and physical drive partitions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction: This technique is associated with the destruction of data on a system, which is relevant to the question's context of data destruction.
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe: This technique is about wiping the disk structure, which includes mapped drives and physical drive partitions, aligning with the specific details mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs provided indicate that the threat actor is engaged in data destruction activities. Since CaddyWiper is a tool that can be used for wiping files and disk structures, it is plausible that Agrius could deploy it as part of its data destruction activities.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that Agrius is not likely to deploy CaddyWiper. However, the TTPs provided do not contradict the use of CaddyWiper for data destruction, and the question's context implies that it is part of the attack sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where Agrius is actively engaged in data destruction activities.
- The TTPs provided are directly related to data destruction and disk structure wiping, which are consistent with the use of CaddyWiper.
- There is no information in the TTPs that contradicts the deployment of CaddyWiper for the described purpose.

Final Answer: A: Yes
