Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether UNC2452, a known cyber threat actor, used Discovery techniques (such as querying the registry and identifying running processes) to gather information about systems and the internal network after initially using an Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control (C2) communications.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery

T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique used for Command and Control communications, which is a Tactic. This indicates that the actor is using a specific protocol at the application layer to communicate with the command and control server.

T1057-Process Discovery is a Discovery technique that involves identifying running processes on a system, which is a Tactic. This technique is used to gather information about the system's processes.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question, we need to determine if the actor used the Discovery techniques (T1057-Process Discovery) after using the Application Layer Protocol (T1071-Application Layer Protocol).

- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the actor used Discovery techniques after establishing Command and Control communications.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the actor did not use Discovery techniques after using the Application Layer Protocol.

The sequence of actions would typically be as follows:
1. The actor establishes Command and Control communications using an Application Layer Protocol (T1071).
2. Once C2 communications are established, the actor would likely use Discovery techniques to gather information about the system and the internal network (T1057).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The actor uses an Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications (T1071).
2. After establishing C2 communications, the actor would need to gather information about the target environment to understand the landscape and potential targets.
3. The Discovery technique (T1057-Process Discovery) is used to identify running processes, which is a common step in gathering system information.
4. Therefore, it is plausible that the actor would use Discovery techniques after establishing Command and Control communications.

Final Answer: A: Yes
