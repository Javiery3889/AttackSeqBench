Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after a malware has established command and control (C2) using Process Hollowing, it is likely to perform discovery by obtaining the name of the user and identifying the explorer process only after achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

The TTPs indicate that the malware is using techniques related to persistence, which is the ability of the malware to maintain a presence on the system. The technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is a common method for malware to achieve persistence by adding itself to the Windows registry to run on system startup.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests a sequence of events: 
1. Establish command and control through Process Hollowing.
2. Perform discovery by obtaining the name of the user and identifying the explorer process.
3. Achieve persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.

Given the sequence, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This suggests that the malware will perform discovery after achieving persistence.
B: No - This suggests that the malware will not perform discovery after achieving persistence.

The TTPs provided do not directly address the sequence of discovery and persistence. However, the typical behavior of malware is to establish persistence first to ensure it can survive system restarts and then perform actions such as discovery to understand the environment and possibly escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already established command and control using Process Hollowing, which is a technique for creating a hidden process that can be used for communication with the C2.
2. The next logical step for a malware is to ensure it can persist on the system, which is why it would create a RunOnce key in the registry.
3. After achieving persistence, the malware would likely perform discovery to understand the environment, which includes identifying the user and processes like explorer.
4. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would perform discovery after achieving persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
