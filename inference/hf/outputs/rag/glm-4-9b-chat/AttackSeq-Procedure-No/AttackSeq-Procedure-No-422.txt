Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will exploit a specific CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposures) in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. The CVE in question is CVE-2018-13379, which is related to FortiOS.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

T1190 refers to "Exploit Public-Facing Application," which is a technique that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications. CVE-2018-13379 is a known vulnerability in FortiOS, which is a public-facing application. T1566.001 refers to "Spearphishing Attachment," which is a technique where attackers use personalized emails to deliver malicious attachments.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. This aligns with the TTP T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. The next step in the sequence is to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. This aligns with the TTP T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

Given that the initial access is through a spearphishing email (T1566.001) and the target application is FortiOS (which is a public-facing application), it is plausible that the attacker would exploit CVE-2018-13379 (T1190) after gaining access.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing email.
Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing email.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is gained through a phishing email, which is a technique associated with Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
2. The target application is FortiOS, which is a public-facing application, aligning with Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
3. The CVE-2018-13379 is a known vulnerability in FortiOS, making it a plausible target for exploitation.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing email.

Final Answer: A: Yes
