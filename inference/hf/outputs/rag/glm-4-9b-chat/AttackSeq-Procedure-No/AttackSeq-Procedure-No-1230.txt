Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Lazarus group, after establishing command and control (C2) communication using backdoor malware, is likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware. Double-extortion ransomware involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to demand a ransom from the victim.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the act of exfiltrating data through the command and control channel, which is consistent with the initial part of the question where the Lazarus group is using backdoor malware to poll remote C&C servers.

T1657-Financial Theft is a technique that involves stealing financial information, which could be a part of the broader goal of financial gain, but it does not directly relate to the ransomware aspect of the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- The TTPs suggest that the Lazarus group is capable of exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a step in the double-extortion ransomware process. However, the TTPs do not explicitly mention encryption or the ransom aspect.

B: No
- The TTPs do not provide evidence that the Lazarus group has engaged in encryption or ransom demands. The TTPs are more aligned with the initial stages of an attack, such as exfiltration, rather than the final stages of ransomware.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if the Lazarus group is likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltration followed by encryption and ransom demands.
- The TTPs provided indicate the group's capability to exfiltrate data over a C2 channel, which is a step in the process.
- However, the TTPs do not include the encryption or ransom demand aspects of double-extortion ransomware.
- Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively say that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware.

Final Answer: B: No
