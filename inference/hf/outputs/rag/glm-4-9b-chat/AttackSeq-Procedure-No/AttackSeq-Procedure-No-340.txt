Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after the Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), it is likely that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit

The TTPs are related to defense evasion and persistence, which are relevant to the question. Specifically, T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions is a technique that can be used to evade detection by placing files in directories that are typically excluded from scanning. T1542.003-Bootkit is a technique used to achieve persistence by infecting the boot process, which is relevant to the initial action of the Nemesis bootkit.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware will place install files into directories excluded from scanning to evade detection. This aligns with the TTP T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions, which is a common method for evading detection.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware will not place install files into directories excluded from scanning. However, given the TTP T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions, this seems less likely as it is a well-known technique for evading detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where the Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the VBR.
- The related TTPs include techniques for defense evasion and persistence, with T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions being a technique for evading detection by placing files in excluded directories.
- Given that the malware has already achieved persistence using a bootkit, it is plausible that it would also use additional techniques to evade detection, such as placing files in excluded directories.

Final Answer: A: Yes
