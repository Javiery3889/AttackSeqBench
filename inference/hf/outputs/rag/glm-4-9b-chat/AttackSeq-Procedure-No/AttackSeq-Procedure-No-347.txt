Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker. The attacker first uses the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to discover system information. This information is then sent to an IP address '45.124.132.127'. The question asks whether the malware is likely to establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. T1007-System Service Discovery is a technique used to enumerate system services and processes on a target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the malware will establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net'. This implies that the domain 'marina-info.net' is a critical step in the attack sequence before the malware can communicate with the C2 server using HTTPS.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the malware will establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server without necessarily contacting the domain 'marina-info.net' first. This implies that the domain 'marina-info.net' is not a required step in the attack sequence.

Given the TTPs provided, T1007-System Service Discovery (Tactic: Discovery) is relevant to the initial action of the attacker using 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to discover system information. T1071.001-Web Protocols (Tactic: Command and Control) is relevant to the potential communication with the C2 server.

The sequence of actions described in the question does not explicitly mention the domain 'marina-info.net' as a necessary step before establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server. The fact that the system information is sent to an IP address ('45.124.132.127') suggests that the malware may already have a direct connection to the C2 server or is using a different method to establish communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker uses 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to discover system information, which is a step aligned with T1007-System Service Discovery.
- The system information is sent to an IP address, which could be part of the C2 communication, aligning with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
- The question asks if the malware will establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net'. There is no information provided that indicates 'marina-info.net' is a necessary step in the sequence.
- Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the malware will establish HTTPS communication only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net'.

Final Answer: B: No
