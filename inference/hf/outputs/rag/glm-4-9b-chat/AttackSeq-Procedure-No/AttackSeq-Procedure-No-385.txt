Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that APT15, after deploying backdoors and using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings, would use Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and steal a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys: This technique involves accessing private keys, which could be related to VPN certificates.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager: This technique involves accessing the Windows Credential Manager to obtain credentials.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- APT15 has already deployed backdoors, which is a form of Initial Access (T1078.002). 
- The use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings could be seen as a method to gain domain administrator credentials, which is a Credential Access technique (T1555.004).
- Mimikatz is a tool known for extracting credentials from the Windows Credential Manager, which is another Credential Access technique (T1555.004).
- Stealing a VPN certificate is related to accessing private keys (T1552.004).

B: No
- The question does not provide any information that contradicts the use of Mimikatz and VPN certificate theft. The TTPs provided suggest that these actions are plausible.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT15 has already established Initial Access, which is consistent with the deployment of backdoors.
- The use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings is a plausible method to gain domain administrator credentials.
- Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential extraction, which aligns with the Credential Access TTPs.
- Stealing a VPN certificate is consistent with the TTP involving private keys.

Final Answer: A: Yes
