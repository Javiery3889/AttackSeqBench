Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the XAgent app, after collecting a list of processes for discovery, will execute by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices only after sending the gathered information out via HTTP to the Command and Control (C2) server.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery

T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. T1057-Process Discovery is the technique of identifying the processes running on a system to gather information about the system's state.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question describes a sequence of actions that the XAgent app is likely to take after discovering processes. Based on the provided TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the XAgent app will hide its icon, run in the background, and only then exfiltrate the data to the C2 server after discovering the processes.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the XAgent app will not hide its icon, run in the background, and will not exfiltrate the data to the C2 server after discovering the processes.

Given the TTPs provided, the sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the following steps:
1. Discovery (T1057-Process Discovery): The app collects a list of processes.
2. Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration): The app sends the gathered information to the C2 server via HTTP.

The question also specifies that the app will hide its icon and run in the background, which is not directly mentioned in the TTPs but is a plausible action for a malicious app to take to avoid detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs provided indicate that the app is designed to exfiltrate data (T1020-Automated Exfiltration), which is consistent with the action of sending the gathered information to the C2 server.
- The app is also designed to discover processes (T1057-Process Discovery), which is consistent with the action of collecting a list of processes.
- The action of hiding its icon and running in the background is not explicitly mentioned in the TTPs but is a plausible action for a malicious app to take to avoid detection.
- Therefore, the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible based on the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
