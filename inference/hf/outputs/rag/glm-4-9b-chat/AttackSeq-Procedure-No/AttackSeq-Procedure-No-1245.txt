Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether SUNSPOT, a component of the SUNBURST backdoor, is likely to monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic. The Discovery tactic is typically used by attackers to gather information about the target environment.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the processes running on a system.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique is used to evade detection by obfuscating files or information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- SUNSPOT is a component of the SUNBURST backdoor, which is designed to perform various malicious activities. The Discovery tactic is one of them, and T1057-Process Discovery is a technique that fits within this tactic. Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe could be a part of gathering information about the target environment, which is the goal of the Discovery tactic. Therefore, it is plausible that SUNSPOT could perform this action.

B: No
- While it is not explicitly stated that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe, the fact that it is a backdoor and part of the Discovery tactic suggests that it could perform such actions. Without more specific information about SUNSPOT's behavior, it cannot be definitively concluded that it will not perform this action.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.
- The related TTPs indicate that process discovery is a technique within the Discovery tactic.
- Since SUNSPOT is a component of the SUNBURST backdoor and the Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, it is plausible that SUNSPOT could monitor running processes as part of its discovery activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
