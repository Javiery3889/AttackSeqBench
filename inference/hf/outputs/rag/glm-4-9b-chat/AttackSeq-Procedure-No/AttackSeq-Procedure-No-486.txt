Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether FamousSparrow, a threat actor, is likely to perform specific actions (retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory) during the Discovery phase after using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access. The question is essentially asking if these actions are part of the typical behavior of FamousSparrow during the Discovery phase of an attack.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction: This technique involves destroying data on a system, which is not directly related to the Discovery phase or the actions mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique is about discovering files and directories on a system, which is relevant to the Discovery phase and aligns with the actions mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that FamousSparrow is likely to perform the actions of retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory during the Discovery phase. The TTP T1083-File and Directory Discovery is directly related to this behavior.

B: No - This answer suggests that FamousSparrow is not likely to perform the actions of retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory during the Discovery phase.

The TTP T1083-File and Directory Discovery is a technique that aligns with the actions described in the question and is part of the Discovery phase. Therefore, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would perform these actions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
