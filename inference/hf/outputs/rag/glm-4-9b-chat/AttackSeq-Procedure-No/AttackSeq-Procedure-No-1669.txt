Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the TDrop2 malware, which communicates with Command and Control (C2) servers using a custom base64 alphabet, is likely to perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after establishing communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

The Tactic "Command and Control" refers to the actions taken by an attacker to maintain persistence and communicate with the compromised system. The Technique "T1132.001-Standard Encoding" and "T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding" are related to encoding commands for communication with C2 servers. The Tactic "Discovery" refers to the actions taken by an attacker to gather information about the target environment, and the Technique "T1082-System Information Discovery" is a specific method for collecting system and network information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifically mentions that the malware uses a custom base64 alphabet for communication, which is a non-standard encoding method. This aligns with the TTP "Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding." 

After establishing communication with the C2 server, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities to understand the environment it is operating in. This aligns with the TTP "Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery."

Given that the malware is using a non-standard encoding method to communicate with the C2 server, it is plausible that it would proceed with discovery activities to gather information about the system and network.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware uses a custom base64 alphabet for communication, which is a non-standard encoding method.
2. This non-standard encoding method is related to the TTP "Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding."
3. After establishing communication, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities.
4. The TTP "Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery" is a method used for collecting system and network information.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
