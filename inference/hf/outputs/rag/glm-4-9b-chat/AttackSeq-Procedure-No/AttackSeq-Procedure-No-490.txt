Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will use a specific sequence of tactics and techniques to carry out an attack. The sequence in question involves stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links, followed by collecting system information and probing files, which are part of the Discovery phase of an attack.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

The Tactic "Initial Access" refers to the methods and techniques used by an attacker to gain the first stage of access to a target network or system. The Technique "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link" is a specific method within the Initial Access Tactic, where the attacker uses a spearphishing email that contains a malicious link to trick the target into clicking on it.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that it is likely FamousSparrow will use the described sequence of TTPs. Spearphishing is a common method for Initial Access, and the subsequent steps of collecting system information and probing files are typical activities during the Discovery phase of an attack.

B: No
- This answer suggests that it is not likely FamousSparrow will use the described sequence of TTPs. However, given the TTPs provided, there is no information that contradicts the likelihood of this sequence being used.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Tactic "Initial Access" is relevant to the question as it involves gaining the first stage of access, which is consistent with the first part of the described sequence (stealing application access tokens via phishing emails).
- The Technique "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link" is a specific method that aligns with the phishing aspect of the Initial Access Tactic.
- The subsequent steps of collecting system information and probing files are consistent with the Discovery phase, which is a typical phase in an attack lifecycle.

Based on the analysis of the TTPs and the context of the question, the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
