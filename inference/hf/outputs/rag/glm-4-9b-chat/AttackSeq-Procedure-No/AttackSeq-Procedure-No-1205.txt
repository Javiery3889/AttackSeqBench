Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Sunburst backdoor, which was delivered through a supply-chain attack, will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This technique is often used by malware to communicate with its C2 server.

T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain is a technique where an attacker compromises the software supply chain to deliver malicious software to the target. This is the method used to deliver the Sunburst backdoor in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved. This would imply that the communication is part of the initial access phase, which is not typical for malware. Malware usually establishes communication with its C2 server after it has achieved initial access to the target environment.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the Sunburst backdoor will not communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved. This is more in line with typical malware behavior, as malware generally establishes communication with its C2 server after it has successfully compromised the target system.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack, which is a form of initial access (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain).
- The typical behavior of malware is to establish communication with its C2 server after achieving initial access, not before.
- The use of web protocols for command and control (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a technique that is generally used after the malware has established a presence on the target system.

Final Answer: B: No
