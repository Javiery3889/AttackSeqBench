Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after they have been infected with QuasarRAT. This question is focused on the sequence of events in an attack and whether the delivery of the spear phishing emails is contingent on the initial infection with QuasarRAT.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client-side application to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves delivering a malicious attachment through spear phishing to gain initial access to the target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that the delivery of the spear phishing emails containing RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery occurs only after the initial infection with QuasarRAT.
- The TTPs provided indicate that the initial access is gained through a spear phishing attachment (T1566.001), which is a separate event from the exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 (T1203).
- The infection with QuasarRAT would likely be a subsequent event after the initial access is gained, not a prerequisite for the delivery of the spear phishing emails.

B: No
- This answer suggests that the delivery of the spear phishing emails containing RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery does not occur only after the initial infection with QuasarRAT.
- This aligns with the TTPs provided, as the initial access is gained through a spear phishing attachment, and the exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 is a separate technique used for client execution.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained through a spear phishing attack (T1566.001), which is a separate event from the exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 (T1203).
- The infection with QuasarRAT would likely occur after the initial access is gained, not before.
- Therefore, it is not necessary for the recipients to be infected with QuasarRAT before receiving the spear phishing emails containing RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750.

Final Answer: B: No
