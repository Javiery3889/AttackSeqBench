Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after a malware uses HTTPS communication for command and control (C2) operations, it is likely that the malware will use a specific command (`cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`) to discover system information and process lists.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1057-Process Discovery

The TTPs indicate that the malware is engaging in activities that involve discovering system information and process lists. T1082 refers to the technique of gathering system information, and T1057 refers to the technique of discovering processes running on the system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes
- This answer suggests that it is likely the malware will use the `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` command after using HTTPS for C2 operations. This aligns with the TTPs provided, as both T1082 and T1057 involve discovering system information and process lists, respectively.

B: No
- This answer suggests that it is not likely the malware will use the `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` command after using HTTPS for C2 operations. This contradicts the TTPs provided, as the TTPs indicate that the malware is engaging in discovery activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that the malware is using HTTPS for C2 operations, which is a common method for malware to communicate with its command and control server.
- The related TTPs indicate that the malware is engaging in discovery activities, which include gathering system information and process lists.
- The command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` is a common command used to gather system and process information, which aligns with the TTPs.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would use this command after establishing C2 communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
