Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that attackers would use parked domains as part of their Resource Development efforts after initially gaining access through a compromised software update (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise).

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- Tactic: Resource Development
  - Technique: T1584.001-Domains (This technique involves parking domains for future use.)
- Tactic: Initial Access
  - Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (This technique involves using compromised software updates to gain initial access to a target's network.)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question suggests that the sequence of events is: 
1. Initial Access (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise)
2. Resource Development (parking domains)

Given the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This suggests that the attackers would use parked domains after gaining initial access through a compromised software update.
B: No - This suggests that the attackers would not use parked domains after gaining initial access through a compromised software update.

The sequence of TTPs provided in the related TTPs indicates that the attackers would first gain access (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise) and then develop resources (T1584.001-Domains). This sequence is consistent with the question's description of the attack sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with Initial Access (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise) and follows with Resource Development (parking domains).
- The related TTPs show that the Resource Development tactic includes the technique of parking domains (T1584.001-Domains).
- The sequence of TTPs in the related TTPs aligns with the sequence described in the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
