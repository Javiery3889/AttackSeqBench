Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on a network through employee-enabled macro execution. The question is centered around the use of Ruby scripts in the context of a specific malware (BlackEnergy 3) and the method of installation (employee-enabled macro execution).

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks: This technique involves checking for user activity to identify potential threats. It is not directly related to the execution of payloads or the use of Ruby scripts.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic: This technique refers to the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros to execute code. It is relevant to the method of installation mentioned in the question (employee-enabled macro execution).

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed through employee-enabled macro execution. However, the related TTPs do not mention Ruby scripts. The TTPs provided are related to user activity checks and the use of VBA macros, not Ruby scripts.

B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed through employee-enabled macro execution. This aligns with the TTPs provided, which do not mention Ruby scripts and instead refer to the use of VBA macros.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the use of Ruby scripts in the context of BlackEnergy 3, which is a well-known malware that typically uses VBA macros for its payload delivery.
- The related TTPs provided do not mention Ruby scripts but do mention the use of VBA macros, which is a common method for malware delivery.
- Given that the TTPs do not support the use of Ruby scripts and instead suggest the use of VBA macros, it is not plausible that BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts in this scenario.

Final Answer: B: No
