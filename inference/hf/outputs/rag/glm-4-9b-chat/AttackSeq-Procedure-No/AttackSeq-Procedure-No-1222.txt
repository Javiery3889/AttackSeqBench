Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where T9000 malware has evaded detection and is running on a victim's system. It mentions that the malware uses mutexes and named events to ensure only one instance runs, and it is likely to retrieve encrypted commands from its command and control (C2) server. The follow-on actions mentioned are cryptocurrency mining, capturing Skype communications, and file theft. The question asks whether it is likely for the malware to perform these actions in the described sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
  - Technique: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion: This technique involves using mutexes and named events to ensure that only one instance of a process runs, which is consistent with the description of T9000's behavior.
- Tactic: Impact
  - Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking: This technique refers to the unauthorized use of a system's resources for malicious purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided TTPs and the scenario described in the question:

A: Yes
- The malware has already evaded detection and is running on the system. It is logical that it would retrieve commands from its C2 server to perform follow-on actions. The TTPs provided suggest that the malware is capable of evading defenses and hijacking system resources for malicious purposes, which aligns with the follow-on actions mentioned.

B: No
- This answer choice suggests that the malware would not perform the follow-on actions. However, the TTPs indicate that the malware is designed to evade defenses and hijack resources, which are consistent with the described follow-on actions.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has successfully evaded detection and is using techniques like mutual exclusion to ensure it runs undetected.
- The TTPs suggest that the malware is designed to perform actions that require system resources, such as cryptocurrency mining.
- The scenario describes the malware retrieving encrypted commands from its C2 server, which is a common behavior for malware to receive instructions for follow-on actions.
- The follow-on actions of cryptocurrency mining, capturing Skype communications, and file theft are consistent with the capabilities suggested by the TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
