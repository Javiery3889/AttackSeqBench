Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where TG1021 has already gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks. The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before they achieved persistence by utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell

The Tactic: Initial Access is relevant to the initial exploitation of the Windows IIS servers. The Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is a specific method within the Initial Access tactic that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.

The Tactic: Persistence is relevant to the part of the question where TG1021 achieves persistence by using web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory. The Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell is a specific method within the Persistence tactic that involves using web shells to maintain access to the compromised system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Execution - This Tactic is not directly related to the scenario described. Execution is about running code or commands on a system, which is not the focus of the question.

B: Credential Access - This Tactic is about obtaining credentials to move laterally or escalate privileges. While it could be a part of the overall attack, the question specifically mentions persistence, which is not about credential access.

C: Reconnaissance - This Tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. Since TG1021 has already gained initial access, the focus is not on reconnaissance but rather on the actions taken after gaining access.

D: Initial Access - This Tactic is directly related to the scenario described in the question. TG1021 has already achieved Initial Access by exploiting the Windows IIS servers. The question asks about the tactic that occurred before achieving persistence, which is a subsequent step.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The scenario described in the question involves TG1021 gaining initial access, which is a direct application of the Initial Access Tactic. The question then asks about the tactic that occurred before achieving persistence, which is a subsequent step. Since the related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access Tactic was already used, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the one that follows Initial Access.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access
