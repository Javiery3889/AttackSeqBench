Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events in an attack involving the deployment of njRAT malware, the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to collect authentication databases, and the extensive use of SideCopy with modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these events.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers

The Tactic "Credential Access" refers to the ability to access credentials from various sources, which is relevant to the use of SideCopy for credential harvesting and browser password stealing. The Technique "T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers" specifically refers to the act of stealing credentials from web browsers, which is also mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Impact - This tactic involves actions that result in harm to the target system or data. While the use of njRAT and SideCopy could lead to impact, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after credential harvesting, which is more about the means to an end rather than the end itself.

B: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial steps an attacker takes to gain access to a target system. The deployment of njRAT malware is an example of Initial Access, but the question is asking about the tactic that follows the credential harvesting, which is not Initial Access.

C: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to an external location. The use of SideCopy to steal credentials and browser passwords is a form of data exfiltration. This answer choice aligns with the sequence of events described in the question.

D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While the deployment of njRAT malware implies the establishment of C2 communication, the question is asking for the tactic that follows the credential harvesting, which is not Command and Control.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of events described in the question involves the deployment of njRAT malware (Initial Access), the use of file recon plugins (not directly related to the TTPs provided), and the extensive use of SideCopy for credential harvesting and browser password stealing (Exfiltration). The related TTPs are about Credential Access and stealing credentials from web browsers, which is part of the Exfiltration process.

Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
