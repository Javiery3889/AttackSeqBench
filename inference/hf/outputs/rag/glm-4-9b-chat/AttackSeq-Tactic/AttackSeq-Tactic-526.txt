Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK tactic likely occurred before the attackers used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and included hidden tracking images in emails to monitor if targets opened them. The key elements here are the use of images in phishing emails, bypassing Google's security systems, and the inclusion of hidden tracking images.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link

These TTPs are related to initial access and reconnaissance phases of an attack, which are both early stages in the attack lifecycle. T1566 and T1566.002 refer to phishing, and T1598.003 refers to spearphishing, which are methods of initial access.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Credential Access
- Credential Access is a tactic that involves obtaining credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems. This tactic is more about the post-initial access phase, where the attacker has already gained access to the system. It does not directly relate to the initial use of phishing emails.

B: Privilege Escalation
- Privilege Escalation is a tactic that involves increasing the attacker's level of access within a system. This tactic is also more about the post-initial access phase and is not directly related to the initial use of phishing emails.

C: Defense Evasion
- Defense Evasion is a tactic that involves evading detection by security systems. This could include bypassing Google's security systems, which is mentioned in the question. The use of images in phishing emails to bypass security systems and the inclusion of hidden tracking images are both techniques that could be part of defense evasion.

D: Lateral Movement
- Lateral Movement is a tactic that involves moving laterally within a network after initial access. This tactic is not directly related to the initial use of phishing emails and the bypassing of security systems.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the attackers used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and included hidden tracking images in emails is related to Defense Evasion. This is because the use of images in phishing emails to bypass security systems and the inclusion of hidden tracking images are techniques that could be part of evading detection.

Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
