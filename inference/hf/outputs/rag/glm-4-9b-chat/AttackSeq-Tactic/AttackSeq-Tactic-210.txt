Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Dropping Elephant gained initial access to high-profile targets. The focus is on the method used to gather information about diplomatic and economic entities.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

The TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through either a drive-by compromise or spear-phishing link. Both of these techniques are associated with the Initial Access tactic, which is about the methods used to gain the first stage of access to a target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Initial Access - This is the tactic that encompasses the techniques of gaining initial access to a target system. While it is a relevant tactic, it does not specifically address the phase of gathering information before initial access.

B: Impact - This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration or system modification. It is not directly related to the phase of gathering information before initial access.

C: Discovery - This tactic involves the process of identifying and understanding the environment, such as the assets, users, and systems. It is a plausible tactic for gathering information before attempting to gain initial access.

D: Reconnaissance - This tactic is specifically about gathering information about the target before an attack. It is highly relevant to the question, as it directly addresses the phase of gathering information before attempting to gain initial access.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the Reconnaissance tactic. This is because the question focuses on the phase of gathering information before gaining initial access, and Reconnaissance is the ATT&CK tactic that is specifically designed for this purpose.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
