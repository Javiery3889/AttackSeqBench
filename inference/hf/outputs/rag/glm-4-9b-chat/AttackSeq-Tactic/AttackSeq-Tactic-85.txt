Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the deployment of custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution. The sequence of events described includes exploiting public-facing applications (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and uploading webshells to gain a foothold. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that would logically precede the deployment of the custom malware.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
  - Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Execution
  - Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

The T1190 technique is related to Initial Access, and T1059.001 is related to Execution. This indicates that the attacker has already performed Initial Access (exploiting a public-facing application) and Execution (using PowerShell) before the deployment of the custom malware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: Execution
- This tactic is related to the deployment of the custom malware (IPsec Helper). However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this deployment. Execution is the tactic that would occur after the Initial Access and Resource Development.

B: Resource Development
- This tactic involves gathering resources to support the attack. It is plausible that after gaining access and executing a payload, the attacker would need to develop resources for further operations. This could include deploying custom malware. This seems like a plausible answer.

C: Initial Access
- This tactic is the first step in the sequence described in the question. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the deployment of the custom malware, which would be after Initial Access.

D: Command and Control
- This tactic is about establishing communication with the compromised system. It is not directly related to the deployment of custom malware and would likely occur after Initial Access and Resource Development.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is as follows:
1. Initial Access is achieved by exploiting a public-facing application (T1190).
2. Execution is performed using PowerShell (T1059.001).
3. Resource Development is the next logical step, where the attacker gathers resources for further operations, which could include deploying custom malware like 'IPsec Helper'.

Final Answer: B: Resource Development
