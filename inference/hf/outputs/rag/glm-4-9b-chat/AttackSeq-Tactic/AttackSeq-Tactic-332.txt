Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after the Bankshot implant has evaded detection and persisted on the victim's network. The key event mentioned is the implants communicating with hardcoded control servers, which suggests a phase of command and control (C2) activity.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading

The first TTP suggests an application or system exploitation, which is a technique that could be used to deliver the Bankshot implant. The second TTP indicates defense evasion, which is a technique that could be used by the implant to avoid detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Lateral Movement
Lateral movement refers to the movement of an attacker within a network to move from one system to another. While lateral movement could occur after the implant has evaded detection, the question specifically mentions that the implants are communicating with hardcoded control servers, which is more indicative of command and control activity.

B: Discovery
Discovery is the process of identifying and collecting information about the environment. This is not the most likely tactic after the implant has already evaded detection and is communicating with control servers.

C: Defense Evasion
Defense evasion is a technique that could be used by the implant to avoid detection, which is mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question is asking for the tactic, not the technique. Defense evasion is a technique, not a tactic.

D: Command and Control
Command and Control (C2) is the process of an attacker communicating with their implant on the victim's network. This is the most plausible tactic after the implant has evaded detection and is communicating with hardcoded control servers, as the question explicitly mentions this activity.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an implant that has evaded detection and is communicating with hardcoded control servers.
- The related TTPs include defense evasion, which is a technique that could be used by the implant to avoid detection.
- The answer choices are evaluated based on the context of the question and the related TTPs.
- Lateral movement and discovery are not the most likely tactics after the implant has already evaded detection and is communicating with control servers.
- Defense evasion is a technique, not a tactic, and is not the most appropriate answer choice.
- Command and Control (C2) is the most plausible tactic after the implant has evaded detection and is communicating with hardcoded control servers.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
