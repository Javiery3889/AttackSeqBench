Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has exploited Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities. The next step in the attack sequence involves the use of a Remote shell module to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server for additional actions. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to follow this sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided indicate that the initial access was gained through the exploitation of a public-facing application (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application). The subsequent TTPs involve Privilege Escalation (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), which is already mentioned in the question as having been completed.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques that are used to avoid detection and analysis. While it is a plausible step in an attack, the question specifically mentions the use of a Remote shell module and C&C communication, which is more indicative of a later stage in the attack.

B: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the unauthorized transfer of data from the target to an external location. While it is a common step in many attacks, the question does not provide any indication that data exfiltration is the next action.

C: Privilege Escalation - This tactic has already been mentioned in the question as having been completed. Therefore, it is not the next step in the sequence.

D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and a C&C server. Given that the question mentions the use of a Remote shell module and C&C server communication, this is the most plausible next step in the attack sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has already exploited Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
- The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was through an exploited public-facing application, and the Privilege Escalation has been completed.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves the use of a Remote shell module and communication with a C&C server.
- Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step is to establish Command and Control communication.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
