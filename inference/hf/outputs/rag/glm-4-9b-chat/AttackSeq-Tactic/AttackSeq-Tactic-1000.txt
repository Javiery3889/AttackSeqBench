Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a Pupy backdoor is used to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure after evading detection through JavaScript obfuscation on compromised websites. We are asked to identify the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred in this sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: Command and Control
- This TTP is related to the use of web protocols (T1071.001) for command and control communication. While this is a plausible TTP, it is not the most immediate action after evading detection through obfuscation.

B: Credential Access
- This TTP is not directly related to the scenario described. Credential access involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the question.

C: Collection
- This TTP is also not directly related to the scenario described. Collection typically involves gathering information, which is not the focus of the question.

D: Defense Evasion
- This TTP is directly related to the scenario. The question mentions evading detection through JavaScript obfuscation, which is a technique for defense evasion (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information). Additionally, the use of the obfs3 protocol (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is another technique for defense evasion.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario involves evading detection, which is a defense evasion tactic.
- The use of JavaScript obfuscation and the obfs3 protocol are both techniques for defense evasion.
- The other answer choices (Command and Control, Credential Access, and Collection) are not directly related to the scenario or do not follow the sequence of events described.

Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
