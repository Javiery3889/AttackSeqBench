Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after the attackers have evaded defenses by using process hollowing and obfuscating the second-stage payload as an image file. The answer choices provided are Persistence, Command and Control, Resource Development, and Discovery.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing

Process hollowing is a technique used for defense evasion, which is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The fact that the attackers used process hollowing suggests they are trying to avoid detection and control. The second TTP indicates that the attackers also used process hollowing for privilege escalation, which is another defense evasion technique.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Persistence - This tactic involves maintaining persistence on a victim's system. While the attackers may have achieved persistence through process hollowing, the immediate action after evading defenses is not necessarily to maintain persistence.

B: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with a command and control server. This is a plausible step after evading defenses, as attackers would likely need to communicate with their command and control infrastructure to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

C: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate action after evading defenses.

D: Discovery - This tactic involves enumerating and collecting information about the target environment. Similar to Resource Development, this is not the immediate action after evading defenses.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after evading defenses by using process hollowing and obfuscating the second-stage payload as an image file is to establish communication with a command and control server. This is because the immediate goal after evading defenses is typically to maintain control over the compromised system and to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
