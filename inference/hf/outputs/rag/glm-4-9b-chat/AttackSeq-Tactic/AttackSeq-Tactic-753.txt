Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Kingslayer gained access through a supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software but before configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection. The answer choices provided are Credential Access, Collection, Initial Access, and Defense Evasion.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

These TTPs indicate that the initial access to the system was achieved through a supply-chain compromise, which aligns with the question's description of Kingslayer gaining access through the supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While it is a plausible step in an attack, it is not the immediate step following the initial access through a supply-chain compromise. It is more likely to occur after the initial access has been established.

B: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the victim's environment. It is a common step after initial access has been gained, but it is not the immediate step before evading detection.

C: Initial Access - This is the tactic that Kingslayer used to gain access to the system, as indicated by the related TTPs. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining access but before evading detection.

D: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading detection mechanisms. The question specifies that the diurnal beaconing algorithm was configured to evade detection, which suggests that this tactic occurred after the initial access and before the detection evasion.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. Initial Access (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise or T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain)
2. [Some other TTPs, which we are asked to identify]
3. Defense Evasion (Configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm)

The answer that fits the sequence best is Defense Evasion, as it is the tactic that would logically occur after gaining initial access but before evading detection.

Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
