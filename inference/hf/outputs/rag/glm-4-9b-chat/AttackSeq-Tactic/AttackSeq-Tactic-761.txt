Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the actors used tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network. The sequence of events described includes the installation of webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence, which is a form of persistence, and the use of Mimikatz, which is a tool used for credential access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool: This suggests the actors were developing resources, possibly tools or other assets.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell: This indicates the actors installed webshells for persistence on SharePoint servers.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This suggests the actors moved laterally within the network using tools.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the related TTPs:

A: Credential Access - This tactic involves techniques that allow an attacker to obtain credentials. While Mimikatz is a tool used for credential access, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred before the pivot, not the technique.

B: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques that help an attacker avoid detection. While it's possible that defense evasion techniques were used to install the webshells, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred before the pivot, not the technique.

C: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It's a common step before an attack, but it doesn't directly relate to the installation of webshells or the use of Mimikatz.

D: Discovery - This tactic involves identifying and understanding the environment. It's a logical step before lateral movement, as it would help the actors understand the network and identify potential pivot points.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
1. Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool)
2. Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell)
3. Discovery (T1566.001-Environment Discovery)
4. Lateral Movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer)
5. Credential Access (using tools like Mimikatz)

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The sequence of events starts with the development of resources, followed by the installation of webshells for persistence. The next logical step would be to discover the environment to understand the network and identify pivot points. After that, lateral movement would occur, and finally, credential access would be used to pivot to additional systems within the network.

Final Answer: D: Discovery
