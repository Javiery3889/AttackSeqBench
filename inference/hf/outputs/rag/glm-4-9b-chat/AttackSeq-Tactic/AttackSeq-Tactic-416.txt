Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker has used Mimikatz for credential dumping, executed reconnaissance commands, and then leveraged the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems using webshells. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred during the latter part of this sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync

These TTPs are related to credential access, which involves techniques such as using LSASS memory to extract credentials and using DCSync to extract domain credentials from domain controllers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Lateral Movement
- This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after initial access. The use of webshells to execute commands on other systems is indicative of lateral movement, as the attacker is moving from one system to another.

B: Reconnaissance
- Reconnaissance is the initial phase of an attack where an attacker gathers information about the target environment. The question specifies that reconnaissance has already been performed, so this is not the correct tactic at this stage.

C: Credential Access
- Credential Access is the tactic that involves obtaining credentials. While the initial credential dumping using Mimikatz and the use of DCSync are related to credential access, the question is asking about the tactic when the attacker uses the credentials to execute commands on other systems.

D: Discovery
- Discovery is the process of identifying and inventorying systems and assets within a network. This is not the correct tactic at the stage where the attacker is using credentials to execute commands.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial credential dumping and reconnaissance are related to Credential Access, but the question specifically asks about the tactic when the attacker uses the credentials to execute commands on other systems.
- The use of webshells to execute commands on other systems is indicative of lateral movement, as the attacker is moving from one system to another.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement
