Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a threat actor, OceanLotus, has already surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server. The next step in the attack sequence involves using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

These TTPs are related to the Command and Control (C2) tactic, which involves establishing communication with a remote server to control the compromised system. The techniques mentioned involve using non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols, which are common methods for evading detection and bypassing firewalls.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. Since the question states that the surveying is already completed, this tactic is not the next logical step.

B: Impact - This tactic involves actions that cause harm to the target system or data. There is no indication in the question that the impact phase is about to occur.

C: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with a remote server to control the compromised system. The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is a method commonly used for C2 communication. This choice aligns well with the related TTPs.

D: Exfiltration - This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's system. While the initial information was sent to a remote server, the use of a custom binary protocol and encryption suggests a more sophisticated communication method, which is more indicative of C2 rather than exfiltration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after surveying the victim's computer and sending information to a remote server using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is the Command and Control tactic. This is because the techniques mentioned (non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols) are commonly used for establishing C2 communication.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
