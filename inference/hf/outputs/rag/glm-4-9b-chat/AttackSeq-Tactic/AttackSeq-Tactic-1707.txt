Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after a phishing email delivered a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro, but before the malware used 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. The sequence of events described involves the delivery of a malicious document, the execution of a macro within that document, and then the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute additional malware.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

The TTPs are categorized under two tactics: Initial Access and Execution. The Initial Access tactic is about how an attacker gains initial access to the target network or system. The Execution tactic is about the actions taken by the attacker to execute their malicious code or payload.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the sequence of events described in the question:

A: Initial Access
- This tactic is about gaining initial access to the target. The delivery of the phishing email and the execution of the VBA macro are part of the initial access phase. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the delivery of the document and before the use of 'mshta.exe'. Since the use of 'mshta.exe' is part of the execution phase, this tactic is not the correct answer.

B: Execution
- This tactic is about executing the malicious code or payload. The execution of the VBA macro is part of the execution phase, but the question is asking for the tactic that comes after the macro execution and before the use of 'mshta.exe'. The use of 'mshta.exe' is also part of the execution phase, so this tactic is not the correct answer.

C: Discovery
- The Discovery tactic involves the attacker identifying and collecting information about the target environment. This tactic is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, which is focused on the delivery and execution of the malicious document and the use of 'mshta.exe'. Therefore, this tactic is not the correct answer.

D: Resource Development
- The Resource Development tactic is about the attacker acquiring resources needed to carry out the attack. This could include downloading additional tools or payloads. The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL is an example of resource development. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the macro execution and before the use of 'mshta.exe', this is the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access phase includes the delivery of the phishing email and the execution of the VBA macro.
- The execution phase includes the execution of the VBA macro and the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute the dropper.
- The Discovery tactic is not relevant to the sequence of events.
- The Resource Development tactic is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the execution of the VBA macro and before the use of 'mshta.exe'.

Final Answer: D: Resource Development
