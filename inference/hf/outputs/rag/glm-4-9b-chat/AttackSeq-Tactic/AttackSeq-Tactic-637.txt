Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK tactic was most likely used by GreyEnergy before they achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers. The focus is on understanding the strategic targeting of ICS (Industrial Control Systems) control workstations running SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) software and servers.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

These TTPs indicate that GreyEnergy used two different initial access methods: exploiting a public-facing application and spearphishing. The context here is that they targeted ICS control workstations and servers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the provided TTPs:

A: Command and Control
- This tactic is about maintaining persistence on a network after initial access. It does not directly relate to the strategic targeting of ICS workstations and servers before initial access.

B: Resource Development
- This tactic involves gathering intelligence and resources to support the attack. While it is a critical part of the attack lifecycle, it does not specifically address the strategic targeting of ICS workstations and servers before initial access.

C: Collection
- This tactic is about gathering intelligence on the target environment. It is a precursor to strategic targeting and could involve identifying potential ICS workstations and servers. This is a plausible answer choice given the context.

D: Reconnaissance
- This tactic is about gathering information about the target environment to inform the attack strategy. It is very closely related to the strategic targeting of ICS workstations and servers, as it would involve identifying and understanding the target environment before attempting to exploit it.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers would be the Reconnaissance tactic. This is because it directly involves gathering information about the target environment, which is necessary before attempting to exploit it through initial access methods like spearphishing and exploiting public-facing applications.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
