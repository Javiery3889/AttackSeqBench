Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify which ATT&CK technique was most likely used before the initial access was gained through malicious Word documents delivered via spear-phishing emails. The key elements here are "crafted emails featuring personal data of the deputy head doctor" and "deceive targets."

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

This indicates that the attack sequence involves spear-phishing, which is a targeted form of phishing where attackers use specific information about the target to make the email more convincing.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1598-Phishing for Information
This technique involves attackers sending emails to gather information about the target. While it is related to phishing, it does not specifically address the use of crafted emails featuring personal data to deceive targets.

B: T1135-Network Share Discovery
This technique is about discovering network shares and is not directly related to the use of crafted emails or spear-phishing.

C: T1591.002-Business Relationships
This technique involves using personal relationships to gather information. It is plausible that attackers might use personal data of the deputy head doctor to establish a business relationship and then use that information in a spear-phishing attack.

D: T1204.002-Malicious File
This technique is about delivering a malicious file, which is mentioned in the question as the method used to gain initial access. However, it does not explain how the initial access was gained, only the method used to deliver the malicious file.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. Attackers gather personal data of the deputy head doctor.
2. They use this personal data to establish a business relationship or to craft a more convincing spear-phishing email.
3. The spear-phishing email is sent to the targets, leading to initial access when the malicious Word document is opened.

Therefore, the technique that most likely involved using crafted emails featuring personal data of the deputy head doctor to deceive targets is:

Final Answer: C: T1591.002-Business Relationships
