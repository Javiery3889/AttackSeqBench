Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection and maintain backdoor connections. They have used `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after these actions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH

T1572-Protocol Tunneling is a technique used to bypass network security controls by encapsulating one network protocol within another. This is relevant because the attackers are using `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH, which is a form of protocol tunneling.

T1021.004-SSH is a technique for lateral movement, which involves using SSH to move laterally within a network. This is also relevant as it suggests the attackers are using SSH for some form of lateral movement.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance
- This technique involves running a virtual instance to avoid detection. While it is a method to evade detection, it does not directly relate to the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH or the use of SSH for lateral movement.

B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution
- This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which could be relevant if the attackers are using a command and control server to execute commands on the compromised system. However, it does not directly address the use of `plink.exe` or SSH.

C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools
- This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or update software on a system. It is not directly related to the use of `plink.exe` or SSH for protocol tunneling or lateral movement.

D: T1137.006-Add-ins
- This technique involves adding new features or functionality to a program. It is not directly related to the use of `plink.exe` or SSH for protocol tunneling or lateral movement.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, none of the provided answer choices directly align with the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH or the use of SSH for lateral movement. However, if we have to choose the most plausible technique that could have occurred after these actions, we should consider the context of the related TTPs.

The most plausible answer would be:

Final Answer: B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution

This is because the attackers have already used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection, and T1202 involves executing commands indirectly, which could be a subsequent step in maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is not a perfect match, it is the closest to the context provided in the question and related TTPs.
