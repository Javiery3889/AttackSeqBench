Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used by T9000 to ensure its components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot after performing DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading

T1546.010-AppInit DLLs refers to a technique where an attacker uses a DLL to load at the application initialization phase, which can be used to ensure persistence by having the DLL loaded with every application started by the user.
T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is the technique used to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which is what the question mentions was done with igfxtray.exe.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
This technique is not directly related to ensuring persistence after a system reboot. It is about evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is not the focus of the question.

B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities
This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection, but it does not ensure that the attacker's components run with every user mode process after a reboot.

C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
This technique is about ensuring that an attacker's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot. This aligns with the context of the question and the related TTPs, as AppInit DLLs and DLL side-loading are methods to achieve persistence.

D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process
This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be used for persistence, but it does not specifically address the scenario of ensuring components run with every user mode process after a reboot.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The question is asking for the technique that ensures T9000's components run or load with every user mode process after a system reboot. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has used DLL sideloading and AppInit DLLs for persistence. The most plausible technique from the answer choices that aligns with this is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, as it is the one that ensures components run with every user mode process after a reboot.

Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
