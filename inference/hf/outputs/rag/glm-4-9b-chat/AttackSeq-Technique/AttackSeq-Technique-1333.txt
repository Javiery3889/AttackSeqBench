Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has gained command and control (C2) through HTTP POST communication or using encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites. The attacker then attempts to move between systems using a net use command following positive ping responses. We are asked to identify the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred during this lateral movement phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the question:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique involves discovering remote systems on a network.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle: This technique is used to intercept and potentially modify the communication between two parties.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools or payloads from one system to another within the network.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking
- SSH hijacking is not directly related to the use of a net use command or the context of moving between systems using ping responses. This technique is more about intercepting SSH sessions.

B: T1021-Remote Services
- This technique involves identifying and exploiting remote services on a network. While it is related to discovery, it does not specifically address the lateral movement aspect or the use of a net use command.

C: T1106-Native API
- This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. The use of a net use command is a native Windows command, which could be considered an API. However, this technique does not directly address the context of moving between systems using ping responses.

D: T1564.005-Hidden File System
- This technique is about creating a hidden file system to store data or tools. It does not directly relate to the use of a net use command or the context of moving between systems using ping responses.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, none of the provided answer choices perfectly match the described attack sequence. However, if we have to choose the most plausible technique, we should consider the context of lateral movement and the use of a net use command.

- T1563.001-SSH Hijacking is not directly related to the described sequence.
- T1021-Remote Services is related to discovery but not to lateral movement or the use of a net use command.
- T1106-Native API is related to using native commands, but it does not specifically address the lateral movement aspect.
- T1564.005-Hidden File System is not directly related to the described sequence.

Given the options, T1106-Native API is the closest to the described sequence, as it involves using native commands, which could include the net use command. However, it does not fully capture the lateral movement aspect.

Final Answer: C: T1106-Native API
