Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to transfer additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains after a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info. The answer choices provided are different ATT&CK techniques.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

The TTPs indicate that the attack involves command and control activities, and there are two techniques mentioned: T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols
- This technique is not directly related to the context of the question, as it involves using email protocols for command and control, which is not mentioned in the question.

B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication
- This technique is about authenticating against a domain controller, which is not relevant to the context of transferring tools or payloads to communicate with C2 domains.

C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
- This technique is about transferring tools or payloads into the target environment. Given that the question mentions the transfer of additional tools or payloads, this technique is highly relevant.

D: T1566-Phishing
- This technique involves using phishing to deliver payloads, which is not directly related to the context of transferring tools or payloads to communicate with C2 domains.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with multiple C2 domains.
- The related TTPs include T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, which is directly related to the transfer of tools or payloads.
- The other answer choices do not align with the context of the question.

Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
