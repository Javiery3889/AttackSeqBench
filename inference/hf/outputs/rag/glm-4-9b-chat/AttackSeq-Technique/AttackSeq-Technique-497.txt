Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the CostaRicto Campaign used a PowerShell loader based on `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` to inject the final payload DLL into memory. The sequence of events described includes the execution of payload stagers using scheduled tasks and the use of a PowerShell loader for reflective code loading.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are all related to Defense Evasion, which is a tactic that involves evading detection and analysis. The specific techniques mentioned are:
- T1620-Reflective Code Loading: This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which is a method that can be used to evade detection.
- T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process's memory space, which can be used to bypass security controls.
- T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting code into a process's memory space, which can also be used to evade detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1587.003-Digital Certificates
- This technique involves using digital certificates to sign software, which can be used to verify the authenticity of the software. While it is a defense evasion technique, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

B: T1090-Proxy
- This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, which can be used to hide the attacker's activities. However, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the execution of payload stagers and the injection of a payload DLL.

C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
- This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute code at a later time. This is directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, as payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks.

D: T1129-Shared Modules
- This technique involves using shared modules to execute code, which can be used to evade detection. However, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the execution of payload stagers and the injection of a payload DLL.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the use of a PowerShell loader based on `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` is the execution of payload stagers using scheduled tasks. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before this is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
