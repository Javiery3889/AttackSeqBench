Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify the ATT&CK technique that occurred after APT-TOCS used lateral movement within the internal network and before communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the sequence of events:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This suggests that the attacker used a method to exploit remote services for lateral movement.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This indicates that the attacker used web protocols for command and control activities.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This suggests that the attacker transferred tools laterally within the network.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall
- This technique is about disabling or modifying system firewalls. It is not directly related to lateral movement or command and control activities, and it does not seem to be a plausible technique to occur after lateral movement and before using HTTP GET requests.

B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application. It is not directly related to lateral movement within the internal network, and it does not fit the sequence described in the question.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique involves using application layer protocols for lateral movement. Given that T1071.001-Web Protocols is a related TTP, this choice is plausible. It could be the technique used after lateral movement and before using HTTP GET requests.

D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
- This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for command and control. It is not directly related to lateral movement within the internal network and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after lateral movement within the internal network and before communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests is the use of an application layer protocol for lateral movement. This aligns with the related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
