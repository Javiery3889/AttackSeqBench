Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the use of DNSpionage's malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure. DNSpionage is a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign that targets DNS records to redirect traffic.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS

These TTPs are related to the discovery of network information, hiding infrastructure, and DNS-related activities, which are all relevant to the context of DNSpionage.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
- This technique is directly related to the discovery of network information (T1016), which is a step that would likely occur before DNSpionage's use of DNS redirection for reconnaissance.

B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules
- This technique is about hiding email content, which is not directly related to the DNS redirection or reconnaissance activities described in the question.

C: T1590.005-IP Addresses
- This technique is about gathering IP addresses, which could be part of the network information gathering (T1016), but it is more specific and does not cover the broader context of DNSpionage's activities.

D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
- This technique is about creating scheduled tasks or jobs, which is not directly related to DNS redirection or reconnaissance activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs leading up to DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes would involve gathering network information first. This is because DNSpionage's activities would require knowledge of the network infrastructure to successfully redirect traffic.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
