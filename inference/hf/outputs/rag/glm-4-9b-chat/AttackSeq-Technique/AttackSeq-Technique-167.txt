Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after defense evasion methods have been used to access credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals. The answer choices provided are different ATT&CK techniques.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation

The TTPs indicate that the attacker has used impersonation to evade defenses and has employed web portal capture to access credentials.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets
This technique involves extracting Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets from the Windows operating system. It is not directly related to web portal capture or impersonation, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.

B: T1090-Proxy
This technique involves using a proxy to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly address the specific scenario of accessing credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals.

C: T1587-Develop Capabilities
This technique involves developing or obtaining capabilities to support the objectives of the attacker. It is a broad technique and does not specifically address the scenario described in the question.

D: T1056-Input Capture
This technique involves capturing input from a user interface, such as a web portal, to steal credentials. Given that the related TTPs mention web portal capture, this technique aligns closely with the scenario described in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that align with the attack sequence described in the question is T1056-Input Capture, as it directly addresses the scenario of accessing credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals.

Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
