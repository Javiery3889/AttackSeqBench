Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify the most plausible ATT&CK technique that occurred after the installation of BlackEnergy 3 on targeted workstations via weaponized email attachments and before the malware establishes a connection to the attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File: This indicates that the initial infection vector was a malicious file, which is consistent with the description of BlackEnergy 3 being installed through weaponized email attachments.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This suggests that the initial access to the network was gained through a spear-phishing attack using an email attachment, which is also consistent with the description of the infection vector.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1110-Brute Force
Brute force is a technique used to guess passwords or encryption keys. It is not directly related to the installation of malware or establishing a connection to a C2 server. This technique is more about authentication and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys
This technique involves using SSH authorized keys for authentication. It is not related to the installation of malware or the initial stages of an attack. This technique is more about establishing secure connections and is not relevant to the sequence described.

C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute code. Given that BlackEnergy 3 was installed on workstations through weaponized email attachments, it is plausible that the malware would use a command and scripting interpreter to execute itself. This technique is a likely candidate for the sequence after the malware installation and before establishing a C2 connection.

D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code at a later time. While it is a plausible technique for malware persistence, it does not fit the sequence described in the question, as it does not directly relate to the actions taken after the malware is installed but before it connects to the C2 server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the installation of BlackEnergy 3 on targeted workstations through weaponized email attachments and before the malware establishes a connection to the attacker-controlled C2 server is the execution of the malware using a command and scripting interpreter.

Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
