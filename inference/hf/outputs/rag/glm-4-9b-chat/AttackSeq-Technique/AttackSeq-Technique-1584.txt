Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks us to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before T9000 communicated with a C2 server using encrypted traffic over a specific port. This suggests that the technique in question is one that would precede the communication phase described.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

These TTPs are related to the Command and Control (C2) phase of an attack. T1571 refers to using a non-standard port for communication, which could be a precursor to establishing a connection. T1095 refers to using a non-application layer protocol, which is another method that could be used to establish a connection that is not typical of standard application protocols.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
This technique refers to using encryption to secure the communication channel. While this is a likely technique to be used during the communication phase, it is not necessarily the technique that would occur before the communication is established.

B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation
This technique involves calculating DNS records to establish a connection. It is a common method used to communicate with a C2 server, but it does not directly relate to the use of a non-standard port or non-application layer protocol.

C: T1123-Audio Capture
This technique is not directly related to the C2 phase or the communication establishment. It involves capturing audio, which is not relevant to the scenario described.

D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
This technique refers to exfiltrating data over a C2 channel. It is a post-communication phase activity and does not precede the communication establishment.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first establish a connection using a non-standard port (T1571) and then use a non-application layer protocol (T1095) to communicate. The communication would then be encrypted (T1573) over the established channel.

Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before T9000 communicated with a C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port is T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Final Answer: B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation

Note: The answer is B because the question asks for the technique that occurred before the communication, and T1568.003 (DNS Calculation) is the only technique provided that could be a precursor to establishing a connection, which is necessary before using a non-standard port and a non-application layer protocol. The other answer choices are either post-communication activities or not directly related to the communication establishment.
