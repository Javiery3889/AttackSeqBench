Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after the threat actors have evaded defenses using Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls. The goal of the actors is to gather internal system information to further their objectives.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided indicate that the actors have already employed techniques related to Privilege Escalation (Tactic) and Defense Evasion (Tactic). Specifically, they have used Masquerading (T1036) to evade defenses and have modified trust controls (T1484.002).

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking
- This technique involves taking control of a legitimate session to gain unauthorized access. While it could be used to gather information, it is more focused on session hijacking rather than gathering internal system information.

B: T1057-Process Discovery
- This technique is used to enumerate running processes on a system. It is a method to gather information about the internal system, which aligns with the actors' goal of gathering internal system information.

C: T1003.003-NTDS
- This technique is used to exploit the NTDS (Windows Active Directory) to gather information. It is a specific method to gather internal system information, but it is less general than T1057 and may not be the first choice after evading defenses.

D: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- This technique is used to enumerate information about remote systems. It is also a method to gather information, but it is more focused on discovering remote systems rather than internal system information.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The actors have already evaded defenses using Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls, indicating they have some level of access to the system.
- The goal is to gather internal system information, which suggests a need for enumerating processes or systems within the compromised environment.
- T1057-Process Discovery is a general technique that fits the context of gathering internal system information after evading defenses.
- T1018-Remote System Discovery is also relevant but is more focused on remote systems, which may not be the immediate goal after evading defenses.
- T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking is less relevant to the immediate goal of gathering internal system information.
- T1003.003-NTDS is a specific technique that may be used, but it is not as general as T1057.

Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
