Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises were used to gain access. The result of this initial access is the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code on the target system.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided indicate that the attack began with Initial Access, which includes the use of T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This suggests that the attackers first used phishing emails to gain initial access to the target system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management
- This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to execute commands on a remote system. While it could be used in a post-compromise phase, it does not directly follow the initial access techniques of phishing or spear-phishing.

B: T1199-Trusted Relationship
- This technique involves leveraging a trusted relationship to gain access to a system. It is plausible that after gaining initial access through phishing or spear-phishing, the attackers would use a trusted relationship to further their access. This could involve using legitimate credentials or establishing a backdoor that appears as a trusted process.

C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution
- This technique involves executing code based on a specific event. While it could be used in a post-compromise phase, it does not directly follow the initial access techniques of phishing or spear-phishing.

D: T1566-Phishing
- This technique is already mentioned as part of the initial access phase, so it is not the technique that would occur after initial access.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises would be to leverage a trusted relationship to further the attackers' access. This is because the initial access techniques (phishing and spear-phishing) are already covered by the related TTPs, and T1199-Trusted Relationship is the only remaining technique that aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Final Answer: B: T1199-Trusted Relationship
