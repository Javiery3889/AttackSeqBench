Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to ensure that ShadowPad remains active after system restarts or interruptions. The context given is that ShadowPad has already been initiated by decrypting an encrypted payload embedded in a DLL loader and launching the legitimate executable as a Windows service.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence
  - Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
  - Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads

The TTPs suggest that the attacker has already employed techniques to load a DLL and embed a payload, which are both related to persistence and defense evasion.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
- This technique involves creating a startup item that runs at boot or logon, ensuring persistence. While this is a plausible technique for ensuring that ShadowPad remains active, it is not directly related to the TTPs provided.

B: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription
- This technique allows an attacker to execute code when specific events occur. It is a form of persistence but is not directly related to the TTPs provided.

C: T1098.003-Additional Cloud Roles
- This technique is not directly related to ensuring persistence on a local system after restarts or interruptions. It is more about leveraging cloud services, which is not mentioned in the question.

D: T1569-System Services
- This technique involves creating or modifying system services to ensure persistence. Given that the attacker has already launched the legitimate executable as a Windows service, this technique is directly related to the context of the question and aligns with the TTPs provided, as system services are a common method for ensuring persistence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for a technique that ensures ShadowPad remains active after system restarts or interruptions.
- The related TTPs suggest that the attacker has already used techniques for DLL side-loading and embedded payloads.
- Among the answer choices, T1569-System Services is the most directly related to the context of the question and aligns with the TTPs provided.
- The other answer choices are either not directly related to the context or do not align with the TTPs provided.

Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services
