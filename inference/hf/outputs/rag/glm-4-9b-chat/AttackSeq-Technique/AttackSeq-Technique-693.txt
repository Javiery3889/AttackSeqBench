Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the Pierogi backdoor communicated with predefined URLs for receiving commands and sending machine information. The answer choices provided are different techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

The T1071.001-Web Protocols technique refers to the use of web protocols for command and control (C2) communication. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique used for exfiltrating data from a compromised system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1205.001-Port Knocking
Port knocking is a method of network security that involves a series of network packets to a server to gain access. It is not directly related to the communication of a backdoor with predefined URLs, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.

B: T1102-Web Service
T1102 refers to the use of web services for command and control. Since the question mentions that the Pierogi backdoor communicated with predefined URLs, which are web services, this technique is a plausible answer.

C: T1562-Impair Defenses
T1562 involves actions that are aimed at disabling or impairing security tools and defenses. This technique is not directly related to the communication aspect of the backdoor, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.

D: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing
T1134.004 is about spoofing the parent process ID (PID) to hide the presence of a malicious process. This technique is not directly related to the communication of the backdoor with predefined URLs, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the Pierogi backdoor communicated with predefined URLs for receiving commands and sending machine information is the use of a web service for command and control.

Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
