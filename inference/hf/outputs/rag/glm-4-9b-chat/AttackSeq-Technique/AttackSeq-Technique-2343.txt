Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a VBA macro is executed using 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL. The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to ensure continuous execution of malicious code every two hours.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

The Tactic "Execution" is a broad category that includes the execution of malicious code. The Technique "T1059.005-Visual Basic" refers to the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros to deliver malicious payloads.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1565-Data Manipulation
Data Manipulation is a technique used to alter data within a system to bypass security controls. This does not directly relate to ensuring continuous execution of malicious code.

B: T1566-Phishing
Phishing is a tactic used to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information. It is not directly related to the execution and continuous running of malicious code.

C: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL
This technique involves using a Terminal Services DLL to execute code. It is not directly related to the scenario described, which involves a VBA macro and a VBScript dropper.

D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to ensure that malicious code runs at regular intervals. This aligns with the scenario where the malicious code needs to execute every two hours.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Step 1: The scenario involves the execution of a VBA macro and a VBScript dropper, which is related to the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.
Step 2: The goal is to ensure continuous execution of the malicious code every two hours.
Step 3: Among the answer choices, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is the only technique that aligns with the need for continuous execution at regular intervals.
Step 4: Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to ensure continuous execution of the malicious code is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
