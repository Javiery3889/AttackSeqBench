Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after Volatile Cedar has leveraged keylogging capabilities for credential access. The key information here is that the campaign is connecting with a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging

From this list, we can infer that the attacker is already engaged in collecting credentials through keylogging (T1056.001). The campaign is also using multi-stage channels for command and control (T1104), which suggests a complex and layered approach to communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the campaign's current focus on connecting with a server backend framework.

B: T1497.001-System Checks
- This technique involves checking for system information to understand the environment. While it might be part of the reconnaissance phase, it does not directly address the connection with a server backend framework.

C: T1001-Data Obfuscation
- This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection. While it could be used to hide the communication with the server backend, it does not directly address the connection itself.

D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the server backend. Given that the campaign is connecting with a multi-tiered server backend framework, this is the most plausible technique to occur next.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The campaign has already leveraged keylogging for credential access, which is a part of the Collection Tactic.
- The campaign is using multi-stage channels for command and control, indicating a sophisticated approach to communication.
- The question specifies that the campaign is connecting with a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant to the described action of connecting with a server backend framework.

Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
