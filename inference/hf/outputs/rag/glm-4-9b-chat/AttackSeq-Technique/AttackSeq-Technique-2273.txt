Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Regin utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection. The answer choices provided are different techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.009-Resource Forking

These TTPs are related to defense evasion, which is the tactic that Regin is known to use. T1027.011-Fileless Storage refers to the technique of storing malicious files in non-traditional locations to avoid detection, which aligns with the description in the question. T1564.009-Resource Forking is another technique used to hide malicious code within a legitimate application's resource fork, which is also a form of defense evasion.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the provided TTPs and the context of the question:

A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
- This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it is related to defense evasion, it does not directly relate to the use of encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas.

B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow
- This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process to bypass security controls. It is not directly related to the use of encrypted data blobs or non-traditional file storage areas.

C: T1113-Screen Capture
- This technique involves capturing the screen to gather information or manipulate the user interface. It is not directly related to the use of encrypted data blobs or non-traditional file storage areas.

D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
- This technique involves hollowing out a legitimate process to inject malicious code. It is not directly related to the use of encrypted data blobs or non-traditional file storage areas.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, none of the provided answer choices directly correspond to the use of encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas. However, given that the related TTPs involve techniques that are part of the Defense Evasion tactic, we should look for an answer that is also related to this tactic.

The closest related TTP to the question's context is T1027.011-Fileless Storage, which is a technique that Regin is known to use. However, this TTP is not listed as an answer choice. The next best choice would be T1564.009-Resource Forking, which is another technique used for defense evasion and could be a plausible follow-up to the use of encrypted data blobs.

Final Answer: B: T1564.009-Resource Forking
