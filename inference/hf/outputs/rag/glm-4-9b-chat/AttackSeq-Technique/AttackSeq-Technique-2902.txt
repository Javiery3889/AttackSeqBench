Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the 'yty' framework used plugins such as 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots and 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering under the Collection tactic. The key information here is that the 'yty' framework is being used for collection activities, and we are looking for the next step in the attack sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

This indicates that the 'yty' framework is being used to collect information, specifically through screen capture and system information gathering.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the compromised system to a remote location. While it is a plausible step after collecting information, it is not directly related to the 'screen capture' and 'system information gathering' activities mentioned in the question.

B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
- This technique involves accessing data from information repositories on the system. It is a plausible step after collecting information, but it does not directly relate to the specific actions of taking screenshots and gathering system information.

C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol
- This technique involves exfiltrating data using a symmetric encryption method without a command and control (C2) channel. It is a plausible step after collecting information, but it does not directly relate to the specific actions of taking screenshots and gathering system information.

D: T1542.003-Bootkit
- This technique involves installing a bootkit, which is a type of malware that operates at the lowest level of the operating system, often to hide from security tools. This is not directly related to the collection activities described in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, none of the provided answer choices directly follow the sequence of taking screenshots and gathering system information. However, if we have to choose the most plausible next step, it would be one that involves using the collected information in some way. Among the options given, T1020-Automated Exfiltration (A) is the most closely related to the collection of information, as it involves the next logical step of using the collected data.

Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
