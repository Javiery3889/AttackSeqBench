Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after a custom tunneling tool was used for data exfiltration. The key elements here are the use of a custom tunneling tool and the need to enable communication between the corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging

These TTPs are relevant because they involve techniques that could be used to enable communication between network segments, which is the context of the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the provided TTPs:

A: T1070.006-Timestomp
- Timestomp is a technique used to modify the timestamps of files and registry entries. It is not directly related to enabling communication between network segments or using a compromised router.

B: T1090-Proxy
- T1090.001-Internal Proxy is a technique that involves setting up a proxy server to route traffic internally. This is relevant as it could be used to enable communication between network segments. However, the question specifies that a compromised router was leveraged, which does not directly align with the use of a proxy.

C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- T1016 involves discovering system network configuration information. While this could be a step in the process, it does not directly address the use of a compromised router or the need for a custom tunneling tool.

D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
- T1095 involves using non-standard or non-application layer protocols to communicate. This is relevant because a custom tunneling tool could be considered a non-standard protocol, and using a compromised router to enable communication aligns with the TTP Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of a custom tunneling tool suggests a non-standard method of communication, which aligns with T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.
- The need to enable communication between network segments by leveraging a compromised router suggests a technique that involves bridging network boundaries, which is described by Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging.
- Answer choice D (T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the context provided in the question and the related TTPs.

Final Answer: D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
