Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the execution of a PowerShell command upon opening a malicious shortcut file and before Asruex malware communicated with a C&C server over HTTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

From this, we can infer that the attack sequence involves:
- Execution of a PowerShell command (T1059.001-PowerShell)
- Communication with a C&C server over HTTP (T1071.001-Web Protocols)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1132-Data Encoding
- This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the execution of a PowerShell command and communication with a C&C server.

B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys
- This technique is related to using SSH authorized keys for lateral movement. It is not relevant to the sequence of events described in the question, which is focused on the execution of a PowerShell command and communication with a C&C server.

C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
- This technique is about evading virtualization and sandboxes. While it could be a part of the broader attack sequence, it is not directly related to the specific sequence of events described in the question.

D: T1008-Fallback Channels
- This technique involves using alternative communication channels when the primary channel is blocked or detected. Given that the question mentions the malware communicating with a C&C server over HTTP, which is a primary communication channel, T1008-Fallback Channels could be a plausible technique that occurred after the PowerShell command was executed and before the HTTP communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the execution of a PowerShell command (T1059.001-PowerShell) and communication with a C&C server over HTTP (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
- The answer choices are evaluated based on their relevance to this sequence.
- T1008-Fallback Channels (D) is the most plausible technique that could occur after the PowerShell command and before the HTTP communication, as it involves using alternative channels, which could be relevant if the primary channel (HTTP) is being monitored or blocked.

Final Answer: D: T1008-Fallback Channels
