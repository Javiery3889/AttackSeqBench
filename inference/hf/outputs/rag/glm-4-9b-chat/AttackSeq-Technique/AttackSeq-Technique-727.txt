Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and encoded with Base64. The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to transfer the collected data out of the compromised systems after this communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context to the question. The Tactic is "Exfiltration," which is relevant to the question as it involves the transfer of data out of the compromised systems. The Technique "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" is directly related to the communication method described in the question. The Technique "T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information" is also related as it could be part of the process to prepare data for exfiltration.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1505-Server Software Component
- This technique is about the use of server software components to achieve objectives. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.

B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- This technique is about exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the implant is already communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests, this technique is highly relevant to the described attack sequence.

C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- This technique is about using command and scripting interpreters to achieve objectives. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.

D: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage
- This technique is about exfiltrating data to cloud storage. While it is a form of exfiltration, there is no information in the question that suggests the use of cloud storage for exfiltration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an implant communicating with control servers, which is a characteristic of a C2 channel.
- The implant is using HTTP POST requests, which is a method of communication that can be used for exfiltration.
- The related TTPs indicate that exfiltration over a C2 channel is a relevant technique.
- None of the other answer choices directly relate to the exfiltration of data in the context of the question.

Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
