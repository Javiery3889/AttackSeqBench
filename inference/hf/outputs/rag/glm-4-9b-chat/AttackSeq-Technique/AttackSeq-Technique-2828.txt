Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely to have occurred after the attacker has used file transfers and executed arbitrary commands for data gathering. The goal is to identify the technique that would enable communication with Command and Control (C2) infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1029 (Scheduled Transfer) refers to the use of scheduled tasks to transfer data from a compromised system to an external location. T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) refers to exfiltrating data through a C2 channel, which is a common method for attackers to communicate with their command and control infrastructure.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1005-Data from Local System
This technique involves accessing data from the local system. It does not directly relate to enabling communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

B: T1102-Web Service
This technique involves using a web service to perform actions on a system. While it could be used to communicate with a C2 server, it does not specifically mention the use of Cloudflare Workers.

C: T1547.008-LSASS Driver
This technique involves using a Local System Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) driver to perform actions on a system. It is not directly related to enabling communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
This technique involves using non-standard protocols to communicate with a system. Given that Cloudflare Workers are a cloud-based service that can be used to run code in the cloud, it is plausible that an attacker might use a non-standard protocol to communicate with the C2 infrastructure hosted on Cloudflare Workers.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that would enable communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service is the use of a non-standard protocol, as it aligns with the context of the question and the related TTPs.

Final Answer: D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
