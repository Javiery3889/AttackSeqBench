Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking about the sequence of techniques used in an attack where malware is capturing user inputs such as keystrokes and clipboard data. It specifies that the malware has already gathered OS and user details, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and is about to start logging or recording user activity. We need to identify the technique that occurred immediately after gathering OS and user details and before starting to capture inputs.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection
- Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging

The Tactic "Collection" is a broad category that includes various techniques for gathering information. The specific Technique "T1056.001-Keylogging" is a method used to capture keystrokes, which is relevant to the question as it involves capturing user inputs.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: T1119-Automated Collection
- This technique involves the automated collection of information from various sources. While it is related to the collection of information, it does not specifically indicate the immediate sequence before starting to capture inputs.

B: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software
- This technique is about using Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to gather information. It is not directly related to the immediate sequence of actions before starting to capture inputs.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique involves using application layer protocols to gather information. It is not directly related to the immediate sequence of actions before starting to capture inputs.

D: T1056-Input Capture
- This technique is about capturing inputs, such as keystrokes. Given that the malware is about to start capturing user inputs, this is the most plausible technique that would occur after gathering OS and user details and before starting to log or record user activity.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where the malware has gathered OS and user details and is about to start capturing inputs.
- The related TTPs indicate that keylogging is the technique used to capture inputs.
- Among the answer choices, T1056-Input Capture is the most relevant to the sequence of actions described, as it involves capturing inputs, which is the next logical step after gathering details and before logging or recording user activity.

Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
