Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where attackers first leverage the Initial Access tactic to send phishing emails. These emails are used to spread malware, specifically Emotet, which then delivers Trickbot spyware. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to facilitate the further delivery of malicious payloads.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are all related to the Initial Access tactic, which is the first step in the attack sequence. The TTPs include:
- T1566-Phishing: This technique involves sending malicious emails to a large number of users.
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique is a subset of phishing and involves sending targeted emails with malicious attachments.
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique is also a subset of phishing and involves sending targeted emails with malicious links.
- T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection.
- T1542.004-ROMMONkit: This technique is not directly related to phishing or the delivery of malicious payloads.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
- This technique is not directly related to the initial delivery of the phishing emails or the subsequent delivery of the malware. It is more about evading detection after the initial access has been gained.

B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
- This technique is a subset of phishing and involves sending targeted emails with malicious attachments. While it is a plausible technique, the question specifies that the attackers sent over 500,000 phishing emails daily, which suggests a broader attack rather than a targeted one.

C: T1542.004-ROMMONkit
- This technique is not directly related to the initial delivery of the phishing emails or the subsequent delivery of the malware. It is not relevant to the context of the question.

D: T1566-Phishing
- This technique involves sending malicious emails to a large number of users, which aligns with the description of the attackers sending over 500,000 phishing emails daily. It is a plausible technique for the initial access and the subsequent delivery of the malware.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to facilitate the further delivery of malicious payloads is T1566-Phishing, as it aligns with the description of the attackers sending a large number of phishing emails daily.

Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
