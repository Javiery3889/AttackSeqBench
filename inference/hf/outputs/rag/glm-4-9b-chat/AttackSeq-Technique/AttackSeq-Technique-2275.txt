Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks how Regin, a sophisticated malware, maintains communication with its Command and Control (C2) infrastructure after collecting data using features like capturing screenshots and monitoring network traffic. We need to identify the TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that best fits this scenario.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture

These TTPs suggest that the malware is involved in exfiltrating data and collecting information, such as capturing screenshots.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. It is plausible that Regin, after collecting data, would use a standard protocol to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.

B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding
- This technique is about encoding data in a non-standard way to avoid detection. While it could be used to obfuscate the communication, it doesn't directly address the method of maintaining communication.

C: T1040-Network Sniffing
- This technique is about capturing network traffic. While Regin may use this to collect data, it doesn't explain how it maintains communication with the C2 after data collection.

D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection
- This technique is about injecting malicious code into a system's process. It doesn't directly relate to maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking for the method of communication after data collection, which implies a technique that would be used to send the collected data back to the C2.
- T1020.001-Traffic Duplication is a method of exfiltration, which is relevant to the Tactic: Exfiltration mentioned in the related TTPs.
- T1113-Screen Capture is a method of data collection, which is also mentioned in the related TTPs.
- Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant to the context of maintaining communication after data collection, as it involves using standard protocols that are commonly used for such purposes.

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
