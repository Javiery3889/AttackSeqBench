Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers connected to their control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com. The key information here is that the attackers have already avoided writing the RAT payload to disk and are now connecting to their control server.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques that are relevant to the scenario:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer - This technique involves transferring tools to the target environment, which could be relevant if the attackers are trying to communicate with their control server.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage - This technique is about evading detection by not storing files on disk, which is already mentioned in the question as a technique the attackers have used.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels - This technique is about establishing secondary communication channels if the primary ones are blocked or detected.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass - This technique is about bypassing security gatekeepers, which is not directly related to connecting to a control server or the context of avoiding writing to disk.

B: T1566-Phishing - This technique involves using phishing to deliver the payload, which is not directly related to the current scenario of connecting to a control server.

C: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation - This technique is about manipulating the command and control channels, which is relevant to the scenario of connecting to a control server. However, it does not directly address the context of avoiding writing to disk.

D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion - This technique is about evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is not directly related to the context of connecting to a control server.

E: T1008-Fallback Channels - This technique is about establishing secondary communication channels, which is relevant to the scenario of connecting to a control server. It is also related to the context of avoiding writing to disk, as it could be a method to communicate with the control server without leaving traces on disk.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is as follows:
1. The attackers used T1027.011-Fileless Storage to avoid writing the RAT payload to disk.
2. They then used T1008-Fallback Channels to establish a secondary communication channel with their control server, which is associated with the domain chickenkiller.com.

Final Answer: E: T1008-Fallback Channels
