Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server. The communication is described as using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port

T1132.001-Standard Encoding suggests that the attackers used a standard method to encode their data, which could be a precursor to encrypted communication. T1571-Non-Standard Port indicates that the attackers used a non-standard port for communication, which is relevant to the question's mention of commonly used ports.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
This technique involves the use of dynamic resolution to resolve domain names, which is not directly related to the communication process described in the question.

B: T1113-Screen Capture
This technique is used to capture the screen of a user's device, which is not related to establishing communication with a C&C server.

C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
This technique is directly related to the question's description of using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports. It is a plausible technique that would occur before the downloaders and backdoors establish communication.

D: T1547.012-Print Processors
This technique is used to abuse print spooler services, which is not related to the communication process described in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server is T1573-Encrypted Channel. This is because it directly aligns with the description of using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports, which is mentioned in the question.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
