Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique was most likely employed by APT28 after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. The context is within the Discovery tactic, which is part of the broader Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) framework.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks

The TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves scanning IP blocks (T1595.001) and then discovering remote systems (T1018-Remote System Discovery). The question is specifically asking about the technique that comes after the discovery of vulnerable systems.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the context of the question:

A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery
- This technique is about discovering resources within a containerized environment. It is not directly related to the discovery of remote systems after scanning IP ranges.

B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
- This technique is about exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. It is not related to the discovery phase of the attack and is more about data exfiltration.

C: T1055.009-Proc Memory
- This technique is about accessing process memory. It is not directly related to the discovery of remote systems after scanning IP ranges.

D: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- This technique is about discovering remote systems. Given that the related TTPs mention T1018-Remote System Discovery as part of the Discovery tactic, this is the most plausible technique that would be employed after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the technique that follows the discovery of systems after scanning IP ranges.
- The related TTPs indicate that T1018-Remote System Discovery is part of the Discovery tactic.
- None of the other answer choices (T1613, T1048, T1055.009) are directly related to the discovery of systems after scanning IP ranges.

Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery
