Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where CosmicDuke has already used Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on network and hard drives, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names. The next step in the sequence is to gather information from removable drives while skipping certain file types. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique corresponds to this action.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery

These TTPs are directly related to the Discovery tactic, which is about identifying and collecting information about the environment. T1120 involves discovering peripheral devices, and T1083 involves discovering files and directories.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1127.002-ClickOnce
- ClickOnce is a Microsoft technology for distributing and installing applications on Windows. It is not directly related to gathering information from removable drives or skipping certain file types.

B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking
- Credential API Hooking is a technique used to intercept and modify the behavior of Windows API functions related to credentials. It is not directly related to gathering information from removable drives or skipping certain file types.

C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates
- Stealing or forging authentication certificates is not directly related to gathering information from removable drives or skipping certain file types.

D: T1025-Data from Removable Media
- T1025 is the technique that involves gathering data from removable media. This is the most relevant technique to the question, as it directly addresses the action of gathering information from removable drives. The fact that certain file types are skipped is not explicitly mentioned in T1025, but it is a plausible scenario that could occur during the data gathering process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an action that involves gathering information from removable drives, which is a clear indication of the T1025 technique.
- The other answer choices do not align with the specific action of gathering information from removable drives.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is T1025-Data from Removable Media.

Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media
