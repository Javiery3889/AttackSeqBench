Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique facilitated APT28's secure communication with their Command and Control (C&C) servers after deploying the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll`. The key here is to identify the technique that would allow for secure communication, which is likely to be related to encryption or a secure protocol.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided include several techniques that are relevant to the context of command and control and data exfiltration:

- T1029-Scheduled Transfer: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to transfer data. It is related to data exfiltration.
- T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication: This technique is about establishing bidirectional communication channels, which is a common aspect of command and control.
- T1008-Fallback Channels: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary ones are blocked or unavailable.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1569-System Services
- This technique involves using system services to execute code or maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to secure communication with C&C servers.

B: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. While it could be used for communication, it does not inherently provide secure communication.

C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
- This technique is specifically about establishing encrypted channels for communication. Given the context of secure communication with C&C servers, this is the most plausible choice.

D: T1218.014-MMC
- This technique involves using Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute code. It is not directly related to secure communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll` is the use of an encrypted channel. This aligns with the need for secure communication, which is a common requirement for C&C operations.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
