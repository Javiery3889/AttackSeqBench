Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after FIN13 leveraged custom passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server for incoming requests within the victim's environment. The answer choices provided are different ATT&CK techniques.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include several techniques that are relevant to the context of the question:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control communication.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling: This technique is about using traffic signaling to maintain persistence on a system.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1204.001-Malicious Link
- This technique involves using malicious links to deliver payloads. It does not directly relate to the establishment of a local HTTP server or command and control activities.

B: T1505-Server Software Component
- This technique involves using server software components to establish a presence on a system. While it could be related to setting up a local HTTP server, it does not specifically address the command and control aspect.

C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute code on a system. It is a broad technique that could be used after establishing a local HTTP server for command and control purposes.

D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications
- This technique involves using messaging applications for command and control. Given that the related TTPs include T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1571-Non-Standard Port, which are both related to command and control, this technique is the most plausible to occur after setting up a local HTTP server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the establishment of a local HTTP server, which is a command and control activity.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves command and control activities.
- Among the answer choices, T1213.005-Messaging Applications is the most directly related to command and control activities, as it involves using messaging applications for command and control.
- Therefore, it is most plausible that T1213.005-Messaging Applications occurred after FIN13 leveraged custom passive backdoors to establish a local HTTP server.

Final Answer: D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications
