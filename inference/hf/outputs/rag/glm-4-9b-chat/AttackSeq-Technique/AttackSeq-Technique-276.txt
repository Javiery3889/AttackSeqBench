Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurs before executing PowerShell scripts to drop additional files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' after the Bandook campaign has leveraged URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.005-Link Target: This suggests that the attackers are targeting specific links, which aligns with the use of URL shortening services.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This indicates that PowerShell is used to execute scripts on the target system.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This suggests that the initial access to the target system is gained through a spearphishing email with a malicious link.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1659-Content Injection
- This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate content. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.

B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
- This technique is used to establish a secure communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

C: T1133-External Remote Services
- This technique involves using external services to communicate with the compromised system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

D: T1584.005-Botnet
- This technique involves using a botnet to carry out an attack. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
1. The attackers use URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by them (T1608.005-Link Target).
2. The attackers gain initial access to the target system through a spearphishing email with a malicious link (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
3. After gaining access, the attackers execute PowerShell scripts to drop additional files (T1059.001-PowerShell).

Since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurs before executing PowerShell scripts, the correct answer is the technique that precedes it in the sequence. The sequence of events does not indicate any of the provided answer choices as a direct predecessor to T1059.001-PowerShell. However, if we have to choose from the given options, none of them seem to fit perfectly into the sequence described.

Final Answer: None of the provided answer choices (A: T1659-Content Injection, B: T1573-Encrypted Channel, C: T1133-External Remote Services, D: T1584.005-Botnet) perfectly align with the sequence of events described in the question.
