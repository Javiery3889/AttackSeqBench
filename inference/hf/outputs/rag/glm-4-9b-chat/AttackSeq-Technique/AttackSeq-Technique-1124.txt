Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has concealed malware using defense evasion methods and then established communication with a command and control (C2) server at the IP address 160.20.147.254. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely used for this communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the attack methods used:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS: This suggests that the attacker used DNS to communicate with the C2 server.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1205.001-Port Knocking: This indicates that the attacker used port knocking to evade defenses.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This suggests that the attacker used a non-standard port for communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation
- This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services. While it could be used for communication, it doesn't specifically address the use of a non-standard port or DNS, which are mentioned in the related TTPs.

B: T1129-Shared Modules
- This technique involves using shared modules to evade detection. It doesn't directly relate to communication methods or the use of non-standard ports or DNS.

C: T1505.002-Transport Agent
- This technique involves using a transport agent to establish communication. It is a more general technique that could encompass various methods of communication, including those that use non-standard ports or DNS. However, it is not as specific as T1571-Non-Standard Port or T1071.004-DNS.

D: T1571-Non-Standard Port
- This technique is directly related to the use of a non-standard port for communication, which is mentioned in the related TTPs. It is a plausible technique for establishing communication with a C2 server after evading defenses.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the described attack is the use of a non-standard port for communication, as indicated by the related TTP Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port. This aligns with the scenario where the attacker has concealed the malware and is now establishing communication with the C2 server.

Final Answer: D: T1571-Non-Standard Port
