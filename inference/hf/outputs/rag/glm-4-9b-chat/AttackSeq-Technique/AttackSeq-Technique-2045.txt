Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where attackers first conduct reconnaissance using fake personas on social media. The next step in the sequence is gaining initial access, which is achieved by sending spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the spear-phishing messages were sent.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context to the question:
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service: This technique involves using a service to conduct spear-phishing attacks.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service: This technique refers to the initial access gained through spear-phishing using a service.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material
- This technique involves using alternative authentication methods to bypass security controls. It does not directly relate to the sequence of reconnaissance and initial access via spear-phishing.

B: T1003.007-Proc Filesystem
- This technique is about creating, modifying, or deleting files, folders, or other objects in the file system. It is not directly related to reconnaissance or initial access via spear-phishing.

C: T1587.001-Malware
- This technique involves delivering malware to the target. While malware could be used in conjunction with spear-phishing, it is not the most likely technique to occur before sending spear-phishing messages.

D: T1585-Establish Accounts
- This technique involves creating accounts on systems or services to gain access. It is not directly related to reconnaissance or initial access via spear-phishing.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, none of the provided answer choices (A, B, C, D) directly align with the sequence of reconnaissance followed by initial access via spear-phishing. However, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence would be:
1. Reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service)
2. Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service)

Since none of the answer choices match this sequence, we cannot provide a definitive answer from the given choices. However, if we had to choose the closest related technique, it would be:

Final Answer: T1587.001-Malware (though it is not the most accurate choice given the context)
