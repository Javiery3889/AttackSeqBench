Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has initiated communication with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP connections and specific URIs like `<c2-domain>/login.php`. The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to transfer stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation refers to impersonating a legitimate protocol or service to bypass security controls. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique where data is exfiltrated through the C2 channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1056-Input Capture
- This technique involves capturing input from a system, such as keystrokes or screenshots. While it is relevant to the data collection aspect of the attack, it does not directly address the method of exfiltration to the C2 server.

B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol
- This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol that is symmetrically encrypted. This does not align with the use of HTTP connections and specific URIs mentioned in the question.

C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking
- This technique is related to hijacking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. It is not relevant to the scenario described in the question, which involves HTTP connections.

D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- This technique involves exfiltrating data through the C2 channel. Given that the attacker is already communicating with the C2 server using HTTP connections, it is plausible that the same channel is used for exfiltration. This aligns with the TTPs provided, which include T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence involving HTTP connections and specific URIs for C2 communication.
- The related TTPs include T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which is directly related to exfiltrating data through the C2 channel.
- Answer choice D (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is the most plausible technique for the described attack sequence, as it aligns with the use of HTTP connections and the TTPs provided.

Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
