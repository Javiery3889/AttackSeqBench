Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the external communication process of Longhorn, after setting up communication with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol. The key points here are the use of a custom cryptographic protocol and the need to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS

These TTPs are all related to command and control activities and involve different methods of communication that could be used to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the provided TTPs:

A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage
This technique involves storing malicious files in a way that they are not written to disk, which is not directly related to communication processes or the use of cryptographic protocols.

B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer
This technique involves using scheduled tasks to transfer data, which could be used for communication, but it does not inherently involve the use of a custom cryptographic protocol.

C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer (Duplicate)
This is a duplicate of answer choice B and should be disregarded.

D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
This technique involves using encryption to secure the communication channel, which aligns with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol and the need to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Step 1: The question specifies the use of a custom cryptographic protocol, which suggests that the communication channel is encrypted.
Step 2: The need to maintain operational security and avoid detection is a common goal for attackers using C&C servers.
Step 3: Among the provided TTPs, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the only one that directly addresses the use of encryption in communication channels.
Step 4: T1027.011-Fileless Storage and T1029-Scheduled Transfer are not directly related to the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication.

Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
