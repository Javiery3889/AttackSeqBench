Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where Dragonfly conducted reconnaissance using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits. The sequence continues with the intent to gather information and culminates in gaining initial access to energy companies using spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred immediately before gaining initial access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are all related to the Tactic: Initial Access. This is the phase where an attacker gains initial access to the target environment. The specific techniques mentioned are:
- T1566-Phishing: This technique involves sending malicious emails to gather information or deliver malware.
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This is a specific variation of phishing that uses a malicious link in an email.
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This is another specific variation of phishing that uses a malicious attachment in an email.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the question:

A: T1598-Phishing for Information
This technique is about gathering information through phishing. While it is a relevant technique for reconnaissance, it does not directly lead to gaining initial access.

B: T1598-Phishing for Information
This is a duplicate of the first answer choice and serves the same purpose.

C: T1070-Indicator Removal
This technique is about removing indicators of compromise from a system. It is not directly related to gaining initial access and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

D: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate
This technique involves installing a root certificate, which is not directly related to the initial access phase or the sequence of events described in the question.

The sequence described in the question involves reconnaissance and the use of spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software. The related TTPs suggest that the technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access is one that involves spear-phishing, as it is the method used to download the Trojan software.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of events leading to initial access.
2. The related TTPs are all related to the Initial Access tactic.
3. The techniques mentioned are all forms of spear-phishing.
4. The sequence involves downloading Trojan software using spear-phishing emails.
5. The technique that most likely occurred immediately before gaining initial access is the one that involves spear-phishing.

Final Answer: T1566-Phishing for Information
