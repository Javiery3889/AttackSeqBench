Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks us to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the version of RAT malware communicated with the C2 servers by encrypting data using AES and base64 encoding. The key information here is that the malware is communicating with C2 servers and the data is being encrypted and encoded.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File

T1132.001-Standard Encoding is a technique that involves encoding data to avoid detection. T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File is a technique that combines encryption and encoding to evade detection and analysis.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1090.002-External Proxy
- This technique involves using an external proxy to communicate with a target. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the encryption and encoding of data.

B: T1021-Remote Services
- This technique involves using remote services to interact with a target. It is not directly related to the encryption and encoding of data.

C: T1132-Data Encoding
- This technique is directly related to encoding data, which is part of the described attack sequence. However, it does not specify the use of encryption, which is also mentioned in the question.

D: T1608-Stage Capabilities
- This technique is about the capabilities of a stage (a component of a malware payload) and does not directly relate to the encryption and encoding of data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the version of RAT malware communicated with the C2 servers by encrypting data using AES and base64 encoding is T1132-Data Encoding, as it is the only technique that directly relates to the encoding of data. However, since the question specifically mentions encryption, we need to consider the related TTPs that include both encryption and encoding.

The related TTPs indicate that T1132.001-Standard Encoding is a technique that involves encoding data, which is part of the described attack sequence. Additionally, T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File suggests that the data is both encrypted and encoded. Therefore, the most plausible sequence would be to first encode the data (T1132.001-Standard Encoding) and then encrypt it (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File).

Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
