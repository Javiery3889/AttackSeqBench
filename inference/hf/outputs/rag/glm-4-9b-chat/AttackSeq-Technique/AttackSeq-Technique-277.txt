Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the VBA code within the external template decrypted data from the malicious Microsoft Word document and dropped files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'. The key information here is that the VBA code has already decrypted data and dropped files, so we are looking for the next step in the attack sequence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
  - Technique: T1221-Template Injection
- Tactic: Execution
  - Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

The Tactic: Defense Evasion and Technique: T1221-Template Injection suggest that the attacker used a Microsoft Word document with an external template to evade defenses. The Tactic: Execution and Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic indicate that the attacker used Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute the malicious code within the document.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
This technique involves using command-line tools or scripts to execute code. Since the VBA code has already decrypted data and dropped files, this technique could be used to execute the dropped files, such as the PowerShell script 'fmx.ps1'.

B: T1053.002-At
This technique is related to using a legitimate application to perform malicious actions. While it could be plausible, it does not directly follow the sequence of decrypting and dropping files.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate. It is not directly related to the sequence of decrypting and dropping files.

D: T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System
This technique is related to modifying Linux systems to evade detection. It is not relevant to the sequence of decrypting and dropping files in a Windows environment.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the VBA code has decrypted data and dropped files is to execute those files. The technique that aligns best with this is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, which involves using command-line tools or scripts to execute code.

Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
