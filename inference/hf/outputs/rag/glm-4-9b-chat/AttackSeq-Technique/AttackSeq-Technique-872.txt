Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where GreyEnergy operators have already used tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials. The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they redirected requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy

These TTPs are relevant to the question because they involve command and control activities, tool usage, and proxying, which are all part of the sequence of actions that might follow credential harvesting.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the provided TTPs:

A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management
This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to execute commands on remote systems. While this could be a part of the broader attack, it does not directly relate to the use of proxies for command and control communication.

B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. It is a method of initial access, which is not the focus of the question, which is about the command and control phase after credential harvesting.

C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain access to a system. Similar to B, this is an initial access technique and does not directly relate to the command and control phase.

D: T1070.004-File Deletion
This technique involves deleting files to hide the presence of malware or to prevent analysis. While this could be a part of the broader attack, it does not directly relate to the use of proxies for command and control communication.

The related TTPs suggest that the operators are using external proxies (T1090.002-External Proxy) and tools (T1588.002-Tool) for command and control activities. The sequence of actions described in the question seems to be focused on command and control activities rather than initial access or lateral movement.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the redirection of requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication is the use of tools (T1588.002-Tool) and then the use of external proxies (T1090.002-External Proxy). The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the proxying, which would be the use of tools to set up the infrastructure for proxying.

Final Answer: D: T1588.002-Tool
