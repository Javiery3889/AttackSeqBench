Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely to have occurred after the use of Seaduke, which is a malware used to retrieve system information and perform updates. The context is that the Duke group is securely communicating with the Command and Control (C2) server over HTTP/HTTPS.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

The Tactic "Command and Control" is a broad category that involves the communication between an attacker's C2 server and the compromised system. The Technique "T1071.001-Web Protocols" refers to the use of web protocols for command and control activities.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets
- This technique is about obtaining or forging Kerberos tickets, which is not directly related to the use of HTTP/HTTPS for communication. It is more about authentication bypass.

B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols
- This technique involves using email protocols for command and control. Since the question specifies HTTP/HTTPS, this choice is not directly relevant.

C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
- This technique is about establishing an encrypted channel for command and control. Given that the Duke group is using HTTP/HTTPS, which are secure protocols, this choice is highly relevant.

D: T1505.002-Transport Agent
- This technique involves using a transport agent to communicate with the C2 server. While it is related to command and control, it does not specifically address the use of HTTP/HTTPS.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the communication is over HTTP/HTTPS, which are secure web protocols.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves command and control activities, and the use of web protocols is relevant.
- Among the answer choices, "T1573-Encrypted Channel" is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of secure communication channels, which aligns with the use of HTTP/HTTPS.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
