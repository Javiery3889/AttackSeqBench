Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking us to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the exploitation of CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 on Internet Explorer users during a strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website. The sequence of events is from the initial exploitation to the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise

These TTPs are related to the initial stages of an attack, including the initial access to the system and the execution of the exploit.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution
- This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute code. It is not directly related to the initial exploitation of CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 or the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.

B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- This technique is about exploiting a public-facing application, which aligns with the initial exploitation of CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411. However, it does not necessarily indicate the sequence of events after the initial access.

C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
- This technique is about hiding evidence of an attack. It is not directly related to the initial exploitation or the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.

D: T1003.003-NTDS
- This technique is about using the NTDS (Windows Domain Services) to execute code. It is not directly related to the initial exploitation or the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the sequence of events would likely be:
1. Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access)
2. Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)
3. Execution (Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution)
4. Hide Artifacts (Technique: T1564-Hide Artifacts)
5. Use Microsoft Graph API for command and control (which is not listed in the answer choices)

Since the question asks for the technique that occurred after the initial exploitation but before leveraging Microsoft Graph API, the most plausible sequence would be after the exploitation and before the use of Microsoft Graph API. The technique that fits this sequence is T1564-Hide Artifacts.

Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
