Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 has already harvested credentials via spear-phishing and employed OLDBAIT. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed APT28 to move deeper into victim networks following their exploitation of internet-facing servers.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials

These TTPs suggest that the initial access phase of the attack involved exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) and using valid accounts (T1078). The reconnaissance phase included gathering credentials (T1589.001).

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
- This technique involves exploiting a remote service to gain access to a system. Given that APT28 has already exploited an internet-facing server, this could be a plausible next step to move deeper into the network.

B: T1021.007-Cloud Services
- This technique involves using cloud services to store data or conduct malicious activities. While it could be a part of the broader attack, it doesn't directly relate to moving deeper into the network after exploiting an internet-facing server.

C: T1653-Power Settings
- This technique involves changing power settings to optimize for performance or to hide activity. While it could be used to hide persistence or activity, it doesn't directly relate to moving deeper into the network after exploiting an internet-facing server.

D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
- This technique involves hiding evidence of the attack to avoid detection. While it is a plausible technique for an attacker to use, it doesn't directly relate to moving deeper into the network after exploiting an internet-facing server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that align with the attack sequence described in the question is to exploit a remote service (T1190) to gain access to a system, which is a direct continuation of exploiting an internet-facing server. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that allowed APT28 to move deeper into victim networks is:

Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
