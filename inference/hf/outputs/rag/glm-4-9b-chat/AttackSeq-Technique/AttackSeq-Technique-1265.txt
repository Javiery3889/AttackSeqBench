Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the PowerShell script decrypted the registry contents and executed a new script leading to the establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool. The scenario described involves the execution of a PowerShell script, which is a common method for initial access and command and control (C2) operations.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This indicates that the attacker used PowerShell for execution, which is consistent with the scenario described in the question.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This suggests that the attacker used methods to evade detection by deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which could be related to the decryption of the registry contents.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1008-Fallback Channels
Fallback channels are used by attackers to maintain access to a system if the primary method fails. This technique is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script or the decryption of registry contents.

B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly linked to the sequence of events described in the question.

C: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography
This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to encrypt communications. While the scenario mentions decryption, it does not specify the use of asymmetric cryptography. This technique is not directly related to the sequence of events described.

D: T1129-Shared Modules
Shared modules are used by attackers to share code across different tools or scripts. This technique is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script or the decryption of registry contents.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, none of the provided answer choices (A, B, C, D) directly align with the sequence of events described in the question. However, if we have to choose the most plausible technique that could occur after the PowerShell script decrypted the registry contents and executed a new script leading to the establishment of njRAT, we should consider the context of the scenario.

Since the scenario involves the execution of a PowerShell script and the use of njRAT, which is a remote access tool, the most plausible technique that would follow would be one that facilitates communication with the attacker's infrastructure. Given the options, T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B) is the closest to this context, as it involves using application layer protocols for communication.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
