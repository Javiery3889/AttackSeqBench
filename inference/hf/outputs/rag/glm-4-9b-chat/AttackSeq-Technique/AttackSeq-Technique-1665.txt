Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used by BlueBravo's malware for bidirectional communication with their Command and Control (C2) servers using HTTPS protocol with encryption via RC4 and Base64 encoding. The key points here are bidirectional communication, HTTPS protocol, RC4 encryption, and Base64 encoding.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding

T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. This includes using HTTP, HTTPS, and other web protocols. T1132.001-Standard Encoding refers to the use of standard encoding methods like Base64, which is mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy
- This technique involves using multiple proxy servers to obfuscate the communication path. While it could be used for bidirectional communication, it does not specifically mention HTTPS, RC4, or Base64 encoding.

B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique is about using application layer protocols for command and control. Since HTTPS is an application layer protocol, this choice is relevant. However, it does not specify the use of RC4 or Base64 encoding.

C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs
- This technique involves using application certificate DLLs to establish command and control channels. It does not relate to the use of HTTPS, RC4, or Base64 encoding.

D: T1106-Native API
- This technique involves using native APIs for command and control. It does not relate to the use of HTTPS, RC4, or Base64 encoding.

Based on the analysis, answer choice B (T1071-Application Layer Protocol) is the most relevant to the question, as it involves using HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol. However, it does not explicitly mention RC4 or Base64 encoding.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies the use of HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol, making T1071-Application Layer Protocol a relevant technique.
- The question also mentions RC4 and Base64 encoding, which are not explicitly mentioned in the TTPs related to T1071.
- None of the other answer choices (T1090.003, T1546.009, T1106) are directly related to the use of HTTPS, RC4, or Base64 encoding.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
