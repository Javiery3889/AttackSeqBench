Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a malware has been established on a system, ensuring persistence by placing it in the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder. The malware, identified as BLACKGEAR, retrieves encrypted C&C (Command and Control) configuration information from blogs or microblogs. We are asked to identify the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after these actions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

These TTPs indicate that the malware has already established persistence on the system by modifying shortcuts and using registry run keys or startup folders. This aligns with the initial actions described in the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains
This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information. It could be relevant if the malware was looking for C&C information from the internet, but it does not directly relate to retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

B: T1102-Web Service
This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the C&C server. While it is a method of communication, it does not specifically address the retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

C: T1588.005-Exploits
This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to achieve persistence. It is not directly related to retrieving information from external sources like blogs or microblogs.

D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding
This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data. It could be relevant if the encrypted C&C configuration information was retrieved in an encoded form from blogs or microblogs, but it does not directly address the retrieval process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, none of the provided answer choices directly match the action of retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs. However, if we have to choose the most plausible technique from the given options, T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains (A) seems the most relevant, as it involves searching for information, which could include blogs or microblogs.

Final Answer: A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains
