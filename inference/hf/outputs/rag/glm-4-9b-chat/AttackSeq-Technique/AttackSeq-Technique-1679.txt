Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have used Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping and clearing log files. The next step in the attack sequence involves executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network. We need to identify the most likely ATT&CK technique that corresponds to this action.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context to the question:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This suggests that the attackers are moving laterally within the network and transferring tools to propagate.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs: This indicates that the attackers are attempting to hide their activities by clearing logs.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping: This shows that the attackers have already accessed credentials.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided by the related TTPs:

A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact
- This technique involves encrypting data to impact the availability of the system. It does not directly relate to executing processes on remote computers to propagate.

B: T1080-Taint Shared Content
- This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. While it is related to propagation, it does not specifically involve executing processes on remote computers.

C: T1021-Remote Services
- This technique involves using remote services to execute code on remote systems. This is a plausible technique for propagating an attack across the network by executing processes on remote computers.

D: T1583.004-Server
- This technique involves using a server to execute code on remote systems. While it is related to remote execution, it is more specific to servers and not as general as T1021-Remote Services.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the described attack sequence is T1021-Remote Services, as it directly aligns with the action of executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
