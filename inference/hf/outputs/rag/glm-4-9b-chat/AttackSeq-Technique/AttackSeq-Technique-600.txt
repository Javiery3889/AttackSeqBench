Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker uses proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and establishes legitimate external websites as C2 servers. The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point and establish contact with the C2 servers.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy

These TTPs indicate that the attacker is using proxies for command and control activities. T1090-Proxy refers to the use of a proxy to facilitate communication, and T1090.002-External Proxy specifically mentions the use of an external proxy.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space
This technique is about reducing the number of possible encryption keys, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence of using proxies and compiling binary files from decoded snippets.

B: T1571-Non-Standard Port
This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which could be relevant if the attacker was trying to avoid detection by using ports that are less commonly scanned. However, it does not directly address the process of compiling binary files from decoded snippets.

C: T1132-Data Encoding
This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, which is a plausible step in the described attack sequence. The attacker might need to decode snippets before compiling binary files, and data encoding could be part of that process.

D: T1556-Modify Authentication Process
This technique is about modifying the authentication process, which is not directly related to the process of using proxies, compiling binary files, or decoding snippets.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the use of data encoding to compile binary files from decoded snippets. This is because the attacker would need to decode the snippets before compiling them into binary files, and data encoding is a common method to obfuscate data during such processes.

Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
