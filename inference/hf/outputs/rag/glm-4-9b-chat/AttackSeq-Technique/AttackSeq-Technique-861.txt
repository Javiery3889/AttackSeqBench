Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where TG-3279 has established beachheads on key hosts using Conpee or Etso tools and added scheduled system tasks using compromised credentials from pwdump6. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port

T1571-Non-Standard Port refers to the use of non-standard ports for command and control communication. This is relevant because the question mentions C2 communication using port 443, which is a non-standard port for HTTPS traffic.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context of the question and the related TTPs:

A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols
This technique involves using email protocols for command and control. The question does not mention anything about email protocols, so this choice is not directly related to the scenario described.

B: T1595-Active Scanning
This technique involves scanning for open ports and services. While it is a relevant technique for identifying potential C2 channels, it does not directly address the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

C: T1571-Non-Standard Port
This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control communication. The question explicitly mentions C2 communication using port 443, which is a non-standard port. This choice aligns well with the scenario described.

D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure
This technique involves acquiring infrastructure for use in an attack. It is not directly related to the use of a specific port for C2 communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the technique that best fits the scenario described in the question is T1571-Non-Standard Port, as it directly addresses the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic in C2 communication.

Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port
