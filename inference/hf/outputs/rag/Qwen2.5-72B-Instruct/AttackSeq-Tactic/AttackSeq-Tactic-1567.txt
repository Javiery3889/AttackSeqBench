### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Konni APT group.
   - The actions include:
     - Leveraging obfuscated scripts to manage the deletion of evidence (e.g., 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs').
     - Using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**
   - This TTP indicates that the APT group is attempting to delete files to evade detection and forensic analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. This does not align with the described actions of deleting evidence and discovering system details.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system and network. The use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details aligns with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The deletion of evidence (e.g., 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs') aligns with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. This does not align with the described actions of deleting evidence and discovering system details.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Defense Evasion** (deleting evidence using obfuscated scripts).
     2. **Discovery** (using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Discovery
