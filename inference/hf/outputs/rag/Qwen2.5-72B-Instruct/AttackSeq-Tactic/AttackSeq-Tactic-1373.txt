### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FIN13 dumped the LSASS process memory and used network sniffing tools to obtain passwords. This is followed by the use of tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to escalate privileges.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic "Credential Access" and the technique "T1003.001-LSASS Memory" are relevant.
   - "Credential Access" involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as account names and passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (A):** This tactic is directly related to the actions described in the question, such as dumping LSASS memory and using network sniffing tools to obtain passwords. These actions are part of the "Credential Access" tactic.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network. While it is a common next step after gaining credentials, the question specifically asks what occurred after the credential access actions.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the target. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, the question focuses on actions that build upon the credential access.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While discovery can follow credential access, the question specifically asks about the next logical step after obtaining credentials and escalating privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that the "Credential Access" tactic occurred after the described actions.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
