### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that stolen credentials were sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This sub-technique specifically refers to using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-standard protocols for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. Since the stolen credentials have already been sent to the C2 server, initial access has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing and sending data out of the network. The question already states that the stolen credentials were sent to the C2 server, so exfiltration has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. Given that the stolen credentials were sent to the C2 server using standard application layer protocols, the next logical step would be to establish and maintain C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. Since the credentials have already been stolen and sent to the C2 server, credential access has already occurred.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after sending stolen credentials to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols is to establish and maintain command and control communication.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
