### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where RIG EK (Exploit Kit) used proxy servers and VDS (Virtual Data Services) to serve exploits through an API reverse proxy infrastructure.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the successful obfuscation of its operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Command and Control" and the Technique is "T1090-Proxy."
   - T1090-Proxy is a technique where adversaries use a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The question implies that the initial access has already been achieved, and the focus is on what happens after the obfuscation.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence is a crucial step, the question does not suggest that the focus is on maintaining access.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The use of proxy servers and VDS to serve exploits through an API reverse proxy infrastructure aligns with the Command and Control tactic, specifically the T1090-Proxy technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While obfuscation is a form of defense evasion, the question asks what happens after the obfuscation, not the obfuscation itself.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the successful obfuscation of the operation.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
