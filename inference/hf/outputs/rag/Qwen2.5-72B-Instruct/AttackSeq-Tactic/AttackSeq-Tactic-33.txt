### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Initial Access** and the technique is **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**. This technique involves sending phishing emails with attachments, such as Word documents, that contain malicious content (e.g., VBS macros).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While defense evasion can occur after gaining initial access, it is not a prerequisite for initial access.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the target before launching an attack. Reconnaissance is often a precursor to initial access, as adversaries need to understand the target environment to craft effective phishing emails.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. Lateral movement occurs after gaining initial access, not before.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. The question explicitly mentions that the adversary gained initial access via phishing emails with Word documents containing VBS macros, which aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Reconnaissance** occurred before the adversary gained initial access via phishing emails. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred before initial access, and the most direct and relevant answer is **Reconnaissance**.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
