### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malware was delivered to a logistics/shipping company through a compromised hardware/software scanner application, gaining initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the malware began identifying financial servers using SMB and RADMIN protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a supply chain to gain initial access to a target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the sequence described, as the malware is still in the early stages of identifying targets.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after initial access and before lateral movement. However, the question does not specify that the malware has established command and control yet.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - The Persistence tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. This is typically done after initial access and before lateral movement. However, the question does not indicate that the malware has established persistence yet.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. This fits the sequence described, as the malware is identifying financial servers using SMB and RADMIN protocols, which is a form of discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the malware performed a Discovery action before moving laterally to identify financial servers.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
