### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Remote Access Tool (RAT) has been executed as a service and has maintained persistence on the victim's system.
   - The RAT then communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server using an IP address argument to the service.
   - The communication method complicates direct access for researchers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic between the C2 server and the victim's system, which can complicate direct access for researchers.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the victim's system, which can also complicate direct access for researchers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they have compromised. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it does not directly relate to the communication with the C2 server described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to additional systems or accounts. This is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary communicating with the compromised system to control it. The related TTPs T1090-Proxy and T1104-Multi-Stage Channels both fall under this tactic and directly relate to the communication with the C2 server using an IP address argument to the service.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to gain higher-level permissions on the victim's system. While this is important for maintaining control, it does not directly relate to the communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the **Command and Control** tactic, as it directly involves the communication with the C2 server and the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
