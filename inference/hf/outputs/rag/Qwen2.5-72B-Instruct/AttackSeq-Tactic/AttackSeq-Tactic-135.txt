### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after FamousSparrow engaged in Resource Development by exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities to acquire infrastructure such as domains and servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring or registering domains to support future operations.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring or registering domains to support future operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate or logical next step after acquiring infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact:** This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the availability of systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and not the immediate next step after acquiring infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial foothold on a target network. After acquiring infrastructure, the next logical step would be to use that infrastructure to gain initial access to the target network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to support future operations. While reconnaissance is important, it is typically done before or in parallel with resource development, not immediately after.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack stages, the most plausible next step after acquiring infrastructure would be to use that infrastructure to gain initial access to the target network.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
