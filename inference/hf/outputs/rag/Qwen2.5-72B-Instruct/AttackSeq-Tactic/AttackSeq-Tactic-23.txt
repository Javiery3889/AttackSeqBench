### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where UNC1945 conducted internal reconnaissance using network scanners and other tools within their custom virtual machines.
   - They then used ProxyChains and stolen credentials to download PUPYRAT and move via RDP to a Windows server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can be used to maintain command and control over a compromised network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves using network scanning tools to discover services and devices on the network, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This technique involves using RDP to move from one system to another within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This choice aligns with the initial phase of the attack where UNC1945 conducted internal reconnaissance using network scanners. The related TTP T1046 (Network Service Discovery) supports this.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - This choice aligns with the later phase of the attack where UNC1945 used RDP to move to a Windows server. The related TTP T1021.001 (Remote Desktop Protocol) supports this.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It does not fit the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised network. It does not fit the described sequence of actions, which focuses on reconnaissance and movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**. The use of ProxyChains and stolen credentials to download PUPYRAT and move via RDP to a Windows server is a clear indication of lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
