### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where PowerShell scripts are used to establish persistence by creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks. After this, the malware communicates with a domain to download additional malware and send collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - **T1053.005 - Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time.
     - **T1547.009 - Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code when the shortcut is accessed.
     - **T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to execute malicious code at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that after establishing persistence, the malware communicates with a domain to download additional malware and send collected data. This communication is a clear indication of the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic.
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It does not fit the context of the malware communicating with a domain to download additional malware and send data.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This tactic involves establishing resources to support operations. It does not fit the context of the malware communicating with a domain to download additional malware and send data.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves communicating with the malware to control it and exfiltrate data. This fits the context of the malware communicating with a domain to download additional malware and send collected data.
   - **Collection (D):** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While the malware is sending collected data, the primary action described is the communication with the domain, which is more aligned with C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware is performing **Command and Control** activities after establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
