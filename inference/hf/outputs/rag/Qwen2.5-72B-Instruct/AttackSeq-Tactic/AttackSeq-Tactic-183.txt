### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to create a .vbs script that downloads additional payloads.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to ensure the recurring execution of these malicious payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves the execution of Visual Basic scripts, which can be used to perform various actions, including downloading and executing additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. Ensuring the recurring execution of malicious payloads is a key aspect of persistence.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While the use of CertUtil.exe and a .vbs script can help evade defenses, the question specifically asks about ensuring recurring execution.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from the compromised system. The question does not mention data exfiltration.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. The question does not mention moving to other systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is **A: Persistence**. The creation of a .vbs script to download additional payloads and ensure their recurring execution aligns with the goal of maintaining a persistent presence in the system.

**Final Answer: A: Persistence**
