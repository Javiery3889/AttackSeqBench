### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Hidden Cobra used a specific exploit (CVE-2018-4878) in a Word document to download a DLL implant (Bankshot) from a specific domain (falcancoin.io).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution" are relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. The question mentions that the exploit was used to download and execute the Bankshot DLL implant, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic.
   - **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While this might occur later in the attack, it is not the immediate next step after the exploit is used to download the implant.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system. While persistence might be a goal, it is not the immediate next step after the exploit is used to download the implant.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources. This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after the exploit is used to download the Bankshot DLL implant is the "Execution" of the implant.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
