### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that was used before DNSpionage gained initial access through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - The focus is on understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets such as .gov domains and a private airline.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
   - These techniques are all related to the initial access phase, where the attacker uses phishing to gain entry into the victim's network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure, but it does not specifically involve understanding the victim's network or identifying targets.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target, including network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets. This aligns well with the question's description of understanding the victims' network and identifying .gov domains and a private airline.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves increasing the attacker's privileges within the network, which typically occurs after initial access has been gained. It does not fit the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the final stages of an attack, such as data destruction or denial of service, and does not fit the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the **Reconnaissance** tactic, as it aligns with the need to understand the victims' network infrastructure and identify valuable targets before the initial access through spear-phishing.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
