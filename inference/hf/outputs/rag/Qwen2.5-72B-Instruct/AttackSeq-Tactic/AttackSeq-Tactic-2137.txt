### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15:
     - They gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
     - They used these credentials for privilege escalation.
     - They then enabled their RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control:**
     - This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control:**
     - This technique involves bypassing UAC to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Bypassing policy settings to enable a backdoor is a form of defense evasion. The goal is to avoid detection and maintain access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
     - While privilege escalation is mentioned, the question specifically asks about the action taken after gaining domain administrator credentials. The bypassing of policy settings is more about maintaining access and evading detection rather than further privilege escalation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment. The question does not mention any discovery activities.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. The question does not mention any data collection activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
