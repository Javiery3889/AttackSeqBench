### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already employed defense evasion techniques such as verifying Google reachability and implementing modular design in the malware.
   - The next step involves the use of a tool called 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information from the victim's web browser, such as browsing history, bookmarks, and cookies.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating accounts. It does not align with the use of 'bird.exe' to gather system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it does not directly relate to gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's system, which aligns with the use of 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information. The related TTPs T1217 and T1082 both fall under the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion techniques were used earlier in the attack, the use of 'bird.exe' to gather system information is more aligned with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the use of 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system falls under the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
