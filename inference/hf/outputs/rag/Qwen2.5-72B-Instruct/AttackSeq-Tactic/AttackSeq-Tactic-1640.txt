### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after MuddyWater exploited CVE-2017-0199 or used macros in files to gain access to victim systems through decoy documents.
   - The key points are:
     - MuddyWater used CVE-2017-0199 or macros in files.
     - These methods were used to gain access to victim systems through decoy documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or document reader) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes code on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. This is typically a step taken after gaining initial access to the system.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is typically a preparatory step before gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This is the first step in the attack chain, which aligns with the use of CVE-2017-0199 or macros in files to gain access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. This is typically a step taken after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is **C: Initial Access**. The techniques T1203 and T1204.002 are both used to gain initial access to the victim's system, which aligns with the question's context.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
