### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10.
   - APT10 gained Initial Access using DLL Side-Loading with jjs.exe.
   - APT10 then established persistence using service installation and Run registry key.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into processes using the AppInit DLLs registry key.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the first step (DLL Side-Loading with jjs.exe).
   - **Impact (B):** This tactic involves causing damage or disruption, which is not mentioned in the sequence described.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is a logical step after gaining initial access and before establishing persistence.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This tactic involves gathering information, which is typically done before gaining initial access or as part of the initial access phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After gaining initial access using DLL Side-Loading, the next logical step would be to execute the malicious code to perform further actions.
   - Establishing persistence (e.g., using service installation and Run registry key) would typically follow the execution of the initial payload.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and establishing persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
