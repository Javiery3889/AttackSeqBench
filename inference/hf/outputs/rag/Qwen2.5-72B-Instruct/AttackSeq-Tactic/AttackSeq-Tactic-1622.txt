### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan to discover machines in the network.
   - After this initial discovery, Earth Lusca exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing to transfer tools and establish network tunnels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While the initial use of HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan falls under reconnaissance, the question asks about the next step after this initial discovery.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While Earth Lusca might use defense evasion techniques, the question specifically mentions exploiting remote services and establishing network tunnels, which are more aligned with other tactics.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. Exploiting remote services and establishing network tunnels are typical actions in lateral movement.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. While the initial use of HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan falls under discovery, the question asks about the next step, which is more likely to be lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after initial discovery is lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
