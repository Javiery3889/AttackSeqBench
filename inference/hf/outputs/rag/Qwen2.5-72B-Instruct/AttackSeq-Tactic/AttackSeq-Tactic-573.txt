### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities where the threat actor has already conducted discovery activities using tools like a NetBIOS scanner and built-in networking utilities.
   - The next step involves controlling infected systems using Dropbox as an intermediary.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This is the initial phase that has already been completed, as indicated by the use of NetBIOS scanner and built-in networking utilities.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly align with the use of Dropbox as an intermediary for controlling infected systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from the system. While Dropbox can be used for exfiltration, the question specifically mentions controlling infected systems, which is more aligned with command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the infected systems. Using Dropbox as an intermediary to control infected systems aligns well with the Command and Control tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after conducting discovery activities, the threat actor likely moved to the Command and Control phase to control infected systems using Dropbox as an intermediary.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
