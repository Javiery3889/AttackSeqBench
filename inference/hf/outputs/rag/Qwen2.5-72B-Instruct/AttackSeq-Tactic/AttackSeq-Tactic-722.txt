### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT28 uses the Komplex Binder to deliver a dropper by saving it on the system and opening a decoy PDF file to initiate the attack.
   - The key points are:
     - The dropper is saved on the system.
     - A decoy PDF file is opened to initiate the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002 - Malicious File**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain an initial foothold in a network. While the delivery of the dropper could be part of Initial Access, the question specifically mentions that the dropper is already saved on the system and the attack is initiated by opening a decoy PDF file. This suggests that the initial access has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on the target system. The opening of the decoy PDF file to initiate the attack aligns with the Execution tactic, specifically the T1204.002 - Malicious File technique.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the target system. This is not relevant to the initial steps of delivering and executing the dropper.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is not relevant to the initial steps of delivering and executing the dropper.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Execution tactic occurred after the dropper was saved on the system and the decoy PDF file was opened to initiate the attack.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
