### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Aria-body backdoor collected detailed information about the victim's host and system attributes.
   - The context involves evading detection through fileless loading techniques and limited C&C server operation windows.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1010-Application Window Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering open application windows to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the adversary sending data out of the network. It is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the context of gathering system information.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While relevant to the initial part of the question (fileless loading and limited C&C operation), it does not directly relate to collecting system information.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. The related TTPs (T1010 and T1082) directly align with the collection of detailed information about the victim's host and system attributes.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running malicious code. While it is a necessary step in the attack, it does not directly relate to the collection of system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred before the Aria-body backdoor collected detailed information about the victim's host and system attributes.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
