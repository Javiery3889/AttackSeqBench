### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used tools like RDPdoor and MBR Eraser to maintain remote access while reducing detection risks.
   - The key points are:
     - The attackers used RDPdoor and MBR Eraser.
     - These tools are used to maintain remote access and reduce detection risks.
     - We need to determine the next step in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561-Disk Wipe:**
     - This technique involves wiping data from disks, which can be used to destroy evidence or cause damage.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While RDPdoor and MBR Eraser are used for this purpose, the question asks about what happens after these tools are used.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. This is a common next step after gaining initial access, but it doesn't align with the context of maintaining remote access and reducing detection risks.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques to gather information. This is typically an early stage in an attack and doesn't align with the context of maintaining remote access and reducing detection risks.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques to steal data. This is a plausible next step after maintaining remote access and reducing detection risks, as the attackers might want to steal sensitive information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after maintaining remote access and reducing detection risks is to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
