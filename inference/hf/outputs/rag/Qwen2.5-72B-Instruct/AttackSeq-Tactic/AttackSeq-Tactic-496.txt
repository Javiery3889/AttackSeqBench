### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Russian-speaking cybercriminals used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems of the targeted organization.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force:** This technique involves attempting to guess or systematically try different passwords to gain access to accounts.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering information about credentials, such as usernames and passwords, to use in future attacks.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information from email accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is unlikely to occur before gaining credentials and exploring financial systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access and control. While it is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs after gaining initial access and credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network and systems. It is a logical step to take after gaining initial access and before exploring financial systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the target network. It is typically a final step in the attack and not likely to occur before gaining credentials and exploring financial systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of an attack, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the cybercriminals used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems is **Discovery**. This is because the attackers would need to gather information about the network and systems to identify the financial systems and the credentials needed to access them.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
