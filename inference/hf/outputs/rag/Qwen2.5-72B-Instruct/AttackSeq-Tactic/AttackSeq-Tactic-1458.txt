### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker sets up persistence through a scheduled task named PolicyConverter and then communicates with compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves setting up a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using legitimate websites to signal or communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or gathering information. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not likely to be the step between setting up persistence and communicating with compromised websites.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. While discovery can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not the most likely step immediately after setting up persistence and before communicating with compromised websites.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the victim's system and transferring it to their own infrastructure. Exfiltration is typically a later stage in the attack sequence and is not likely to occur between setting up persistence and communicating with compromised websites.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After setting up persistence, the next logical step is to establish a command and control channel to manage the compromised system. Communicating with compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests is a common method of C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker established a command and control channel after setting up persistence and before communicating with compromised legitimate websites.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
