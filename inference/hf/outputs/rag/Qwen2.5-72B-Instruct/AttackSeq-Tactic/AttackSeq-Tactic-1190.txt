### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where SUNSPOT malware modified the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor. Before this, it monitored running processes for MsBuild.exe to detect the targeted build.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves making files or information more difficult to detect or understand.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes to understand the environment.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves gaining initial access by compromising a software supply chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that affect the availability or integrity of systems and data. This does not align with the described sequence of events, which focuses on gaining access and modifying code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. While this could be a part of the broader attack, it is not directly related to the described sequence of monitoring processes and modifying code.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target environment. The technique T1057-Process Discovery is directly mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the described sequence of monitoring running processes for MsBuild.exe.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - The Lateral Movement tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. This does not align with the described sequence, which focuses on monitoring processes and modifying code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of events, the most plausible answer is the Discovery tactic, as it involves monitoring running processes to understand the environment before modifying the source code.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
