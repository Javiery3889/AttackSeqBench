### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through spear phishing but before the infected device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing to maintain access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a link in a spear phishing email that, when clicked, leads to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending an attachment in a spear phishing email that, when opened, leads to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media to spread malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access**: The spear phishing techniques (T1566.002 and T1566.001) are part of the Initial Access tactic, which is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Persistent C2 Beaconing**: This is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic, which occurs after the initial access to maintain long-term control over the compromised device.
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It is often used after initial access to ensure the attacker's presence remains undetected.
   - **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand the attacker's control. It typically occurs after initial access and before or after establishing C2.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target network and systems. It is often used after initial access to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Impact (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. It is typically a later stage in the attack sequence, often after the attacker has achieved their objectives.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After initial access through spear phishing, the attacker would likely want to understand the environment and gather information before establishing persistent C2 beaconing.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic to occur between initial access and C2 beaconing is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Discovery
