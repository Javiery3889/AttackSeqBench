### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred after FIN7 gained admin privileges using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT and before the exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client from the victim network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This indicates that data exfiltration is a key part of the attack sequence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This indicates that PowerShell was used for execution, which aligns with the installation of the PowerShell RAT.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim network. It is a logical step after gaining admin privileges and installing a RAT, as the attacker would need to collect data before exfiltrating it.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While this could be a step in the attack, the question states that admin privileges have already been gained, so this is less likely to be the next step.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is important, it is typically done earlier in the attack to maintain access and is not necessarily the next step after gaining admin privileges and installing a RAT.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim network. While discovery is important, it is typically done earlier in the attack to identify targets and vulnerabilities. Given that admin privileges have been gained and a RAT is installed, the focus is likely on collecting and exfiltrating data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible next step after gaining admin privileges and installing a PowerShell RAT, and before exfiltrating data, is to collect the data.

**Final Answer: A: Collection**
