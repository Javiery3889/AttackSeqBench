### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FIN13 has already conducted network mapping and acquired credentials during reconnaissance.
   - The next step involves using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the use of JSPRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement (T1021) involves moving through a network to access additional systems and resources.
     - This could be a plausible next step after reconnaissance and before using JSPRAT, but it is not the most immediate step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development (T1583) involves establishing resources for use in campaigns.
     - This is a preparatory step and typically occurs before reconnaissance, not after.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access (T1190) involves gaining entry to a network.
     - This is a step that typically occurs before reconnaissance and is not a likely candidate for the step immediately before using JSPRAT.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance (T1589) involves gathering information to support future operations.
     - The question already states that reconnaissance has been conducted, including network mapping and acquiring credentials. Therefore, this is not a plausible next step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that reconnaissance has already been conducted and the next step involves using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying, the most likely preceding step is **Lateral Movement**.
   - Lateral Movement would allow the attacker to move through the network and position themselves to use JSPRAT effectively.

### Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement
