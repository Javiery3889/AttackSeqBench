### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where obfuscation methods were used for macro scripts to deliver a backdoor payload. After this, the PRB-Backdoor began communicating with a command and control server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net) to send and receive further commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the backdoor is using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with the command and control server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This suggests that the initial execution of the backdoor was through a malicious file, likely the macro script.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This indicates that the backdoor used obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** While defense evasion is a crucial part of the attack, it is not the primary tactic that occurs when the backdoor begins communicating with the command and control server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This is the most relevant choice because the question specifically mentions the backdoor communicating with a command and control server to send and receive further commands. The related TTP (T1071.001-Web Protocols) directly supports this.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic is not mentioned in the question or the related TTPs. It is not relevant to the communication with the command and control server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** While initial access is part of the attack sequence, it is not the focus of the question, which is about the communication with the command and control server.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
