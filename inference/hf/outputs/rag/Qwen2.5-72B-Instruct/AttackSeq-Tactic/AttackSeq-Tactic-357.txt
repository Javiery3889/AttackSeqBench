### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after data collection using a custom storage file format but before data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This indicates that data was exfiltrated over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This indicates that data was collected and stored using a custom storage file format.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where data is exfiltrated over the C2 channel. It cannot be the tactic that occurred after data collection but before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial compromise and data collection. It is not a plausible step between data collection and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic where the adversary establishes and maintains control over the compromised system. This is a necessary step before exfiltration but does not directly follow data collection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation is the tactic where the adversary gains higher-level permissions on the system. This can occur after initial access and before data collection, but it is not a necessary step between data collection and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after data collection using a custom storage file format, the next step would be to prepare the data for exfiltration, which is part of the **Command and Control** tactic. The C2 channel is used to send commands and receive data, making it a logical step before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
