### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the initial access via spear-phishing emails.
   - The initial access method is described as spear-phishing emails distributing malicious Microsoft Office documents disguised as job postings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access technique used is T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. It is a common first step in many cyber attacks, as attackers need to understand their target to craft effective spear-phishing emails.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious documents. While this is important, it typically follows reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This is the tactic that directly describes the use of spear-phishing emails to gain initial access. Since the question is asking about what happened before this, this cannot be the correct answer.
   - **Privilege Escalation (D):** This tactic involves increasing the attacker's privileges within the target's network. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and is not relevant to the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that reconnaissance occurred before the initial access via spear-phishing emails. The attacker would need to gather information about the target to craft convincing spear-phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
