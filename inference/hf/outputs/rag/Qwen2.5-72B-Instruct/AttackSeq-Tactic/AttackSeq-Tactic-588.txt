### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and before the attackers evaded detection by masquerading their backdoor connections as SSL connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Internet Explorer) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making the malicious activity appear benign to evade detection, such as masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the victim's network. It is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and before evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain a foothold in the victim's network. The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer is part of the initial access, so this choice does not fit the sequence as it is already mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:** This tactic involves the execution of the malicious payload. The exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability (T1203) is part of the execution phase, so this choice does not fit the sequence as it is already mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities and before the masquerading of backdoor connections is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
