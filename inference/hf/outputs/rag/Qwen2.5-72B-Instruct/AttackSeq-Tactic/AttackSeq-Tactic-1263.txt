### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Fox Kitten Campaign engaged in lateral movement using tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' to map and access various systems within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using valid accounts and knowledge of remote services to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with systems under the attacker's control. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it typically occurs before or concurrently with lateral movement, not after.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to access systems. While credential access can be a precursor to lateral movement, the question specifies that lateral movement has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the network. Exfiltration is a logical next step after gaining access to multiple systems through lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While privilege escalation can occur during or after lateral movement, it is not the most likely next step given the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after lateral movement is exfiltration. The attacker has already mapped and accessed various systems within the network, and the logical next step would be to steal data.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
