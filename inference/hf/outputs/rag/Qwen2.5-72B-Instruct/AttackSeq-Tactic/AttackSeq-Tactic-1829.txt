### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method using a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via a watering hole attack.
   - After gaining initial access, the Poison Ivy RAT communicates with domains such as diff.qohub.info.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic is already described in the question as the initial step using the CVE 2014-0515 exploit. Therefore, it cannot be the next step.
   - **Persistence (A):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While it is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question specifically mentions communication with a domain, which is more indicative of command and control.
   - **Exfiltration (B):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. While it can occur after gaining initial access, the question does not provide any indication of data exfiltration at this stage.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with the compromised system to control it. The mention of the Poison Ivy RAT communicating with domains such as diff.qohub.info strongly suggests that the next step is command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, the next step is command and control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
