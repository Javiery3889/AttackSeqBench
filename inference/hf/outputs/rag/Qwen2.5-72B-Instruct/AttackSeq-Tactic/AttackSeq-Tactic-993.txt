### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through malvertising distributed via high-profile ad networks like DoubleClick and Bing Ads.
   - The next step involves using 'domain shadowing' with stolen registration credentials to configure malicious subdomains for filtering and redirection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves the use of domains for malicious purposes, which aligns with the use of domain shadowing.
   - **T1583.008-Malvertising:** This technique involves the use of online advertising to distribute malware, which aligns with the initial access method described.
   - **T1583.001-Domains:** This technique also involves the use of domains, which further supports the use of domain shadowing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While domain shadowing can be used for defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the tactic involved in using domain shadowing, which is more aligned with resource development.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target. The question does not mention data collection, so this is not the most relevant choice.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves techniques to gain initial access to a system. While malvertising is used for initial access, the question specifically asks about the use of domain shadowing, which is more aligned with resource development.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution** - This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. The question does not mention the execution of code, so this is not the most relevant choice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Resource Development**. The use of domain shadowing with stolen registration credentials to configure malicious subdomains for filtering and redirection is a resource development technique.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion** (This is incorrect based on the reasoning above. The correct answer is **C: Initial Access** for the initial access method, but the specific technique of domain shadowing is more aligned with **Resource Development**. However, since the question asks for the most likely involved tactic, the correct answer is **C: Initial Access**.)

**Correct Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
