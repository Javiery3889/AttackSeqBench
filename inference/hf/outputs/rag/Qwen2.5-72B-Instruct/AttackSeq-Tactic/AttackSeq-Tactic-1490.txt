### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Iranian hackers:
     - They used spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages on social media to gain initial access.
     - They then harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique involves using social media or other online services to send spear-phishing messages.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broader category of phishing techniques.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.003, T1566, T1566.002):** These techniques are used to gain initial access to a system or network. The question states that the hackers used spear-phishing messages to gain initial access, which aligns with these techniques.
   - **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. The question mentions that the hackers harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections, which is a form of credential access.
   - **Impact (A):** This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This does not fit the context of the question, which is about gaining and using credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this could be relevant, it is not the primary focus of the question, which is about gaining and using credentials.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system. This could be relevant after gaining initial access, but the question specifically asks about the step before harvesting credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the hackers gained initial access through spear-phishing and then moved to credential access to harvest email credentials.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between gaining initial access and harvesting credentials is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
