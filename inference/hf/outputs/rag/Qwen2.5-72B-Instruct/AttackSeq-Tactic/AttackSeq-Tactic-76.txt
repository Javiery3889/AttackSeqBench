### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the threat actor initially gains access through malicious RTF documents or Excel spreadsheets.
   - After gaining initial access, the threat actor uses AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 (Command and Control) host and hide their identity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves using various methods to obfuscate the infrastructure used for command and control, which aligns with the use of AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic and hide the C2 host.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear benign to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the use of AWS Global Accelerator.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access, which is already mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control:** This aligns with the use of AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to the C2 host and hide the threat actor's identity. The related TTP T1665 (Hide Infrastructure) is a Command and Control technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system, which is not directly related to the use of AWS Global Accelerator to hide the C2 host.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time, which is not directly related to the use of AWS Global Accelerator to hide the C2 host.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in a system, which has already been achieved through the use of malicious RTF documents or Excel spreadsheets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
