### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the CopyKittens' Remote Access Tool (RAT) ensured persistence by creating a registry key for automatic execution and scheduling recurring tasks.
   - The key points are:
     - The RAT has already established persistence.
     - The persistence methods used are creating a registry key and scheduling recurring tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
   - This confirms that the persistence has been established using scheduled tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the tactic that has already been established. The question asks what happened **after** persistence was ensured.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials, which could be a logical next step after ensuring persistence, but it is not the most immediate or likely next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. This could be a logical next step after ensuring persistence, as the attacker might want to spread to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. Ensuring persistence itself is a form of defense evasion, but the question asks about what happens after persistence is established. Defense evasion could still be a next step, but it is not as immediate as lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible next step after ensuring persistence is **Lateral Movement**. This is because once the attacker has established a foothold and ensured persistence, the next logical step is to spread to other systems to gain more control and access.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
