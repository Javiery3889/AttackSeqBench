### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - Ensured persistence by changing the timestamps of files.
     - Scanned IP ranges to gather information about the target environment.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:**
     - This technique involves scanning IP ranges to gather information about the target environment.
   - **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp:**
     - This technique involves changing the timestamps of files to conceal them from detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1070.006-Timestomp (Defense Evasion):**
     - This technique is used to change the timestamps of files to avoid detection, which aligns with the action of ensuring persistence by concealing files.
   - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks (Reconnaissance):**
     - This technique is used to gather information about the target environment by scanning IP ranges, which is the action that occurs after the files are concealed.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of actions is:
     1. Ensure persistence by changing the timestamps of files (Defense Evasion).
     2. Scan IP ranges to gather information (Reconnaissance).

5. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:**
     - This aligns with the action of changing the timestamps of files to conceal them.
   - **B: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves actions that disrupt or destroy the target's systems, which does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Execution:**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is not mentioned in the sequence.
   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
