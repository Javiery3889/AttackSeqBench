### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Higaisa APT group used a JavaScript file to execute `cmd /c ipconfig` to retrieve IP address information.
   - The key action here is the retrieval of IP address information, which is a form of network configuration discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the specific technique is **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery**.
   - This technique involves adversaries attempting to gather information about the network configuration of a system, which includes IP addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the action of retrieving IP address information.
   - **B: Impact** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. Retrieving IP address information is not an impact action.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves techniques to establish resources for use in campaigns. This is not directly related to the action of retrieving IP address information.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. The specific technique T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery aligns perfectly with the action of retrieving IP address information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific action described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred before the execution of `cmd /c ipconfig`.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
