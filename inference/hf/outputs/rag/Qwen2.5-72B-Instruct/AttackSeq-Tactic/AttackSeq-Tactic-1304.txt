### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Chinese APT actors deployed a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute their malware payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data out of the network. It typically occurs after the attacker has already gained access and executed their payload.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It usually happens after the attacker has gained access and is preparing to exfiltrate data.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial entry into the target system. This could be through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or other means.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves the actual execution of the malware payload. In this case, the execution is via DLL sideloading.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading, which is a technique under the **Execution** tactic.
   - Before the execution of the malware payload via DLL sideloading, the attackers must have gained initial access to the system. This is a prerequisite for any further actions, including execution.
   - The other options (Exfiltration and Collection) typically occur after the initial access and execution phases.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
