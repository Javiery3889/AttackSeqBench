### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the threat actor "Kingslayer" gained access through a supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software.
   - The next step in the sequence is to configure a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.
   - We need to determine what ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a supply chain compromise (T1195 and T1195.002).
   - This confirms that the initial access has already been established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which could be a logical next step after gaining initial access, but it is not necessarily the most immediate step before configuring a beaconing algorithm.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the victim's system, which is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and not immediately after initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic has already been established through the supply chain compromise, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis, which aligns well with the configuration of a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial access has already been achieved through the supply chain compromise, the next logical step before configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm would be to evade detection.
   - Configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic, as it helps the attacker maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
