### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial access via CVE-2021-26855 in MS Exchange and before the use of the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This technique describes how attackers exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, such as CVE-2021-26855 in MS Exchange, to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):** This technique describes how attackers use the Windows Task Scheduler to maintain persistence on a victim system.
   - **Execution (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):** This technique describes how attackers use the Windows Task Scheduler to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attackers gain initial access.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):** This is the final step in the attack sequence, where the attackers set up persistence.
   - **Execution (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):** This technique is part of the persistence tactic, but it can also be used to execute malicious code after gaining initial access.

   Given the sequence:
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)**
   - **[Unknown Tactic]**
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task)**

   The unknown tactic must be something that occurs between gaining initial access and setting up persistence. The most plausible tactic in this context is **Discovery** (Tactic B), as it is common for attackers to perform reconnaissance and discovery activities to understand the environment and identify targets for further exploitation before setting up persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **Final Answer: B: Discovery**
