### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved the use of a domain 'update.alyac.org' resolving to a South Korean IP address to monitor and control infected computers before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:**
     - This technique involves using a domain or IP address to establish a communication channel with a command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it does not directly involve the use of a domain to control infected computers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems. This is typically done to identify targets for further exploitation but does not involve controlling infected computers.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. The use of a domain to monitor and control infected computers aligns perfectly with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it occurs after the C2 phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of a domain to establish and maintain control over infected computers, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
