### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Taidoor attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents such as .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, and .PPT files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves adversaries gaining initial access to a system by sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the tactic that directly describes the action of gaining initial access to a system. The technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is a method used to achieve initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information from a system. While it can occur after initial access, it is not a prerequisite for gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to support future operations. It can occur before initial access but is not as directly related to the specific method of gaining access via spearphishing attachments.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first performed reconnaissance to gather information, but the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred immediately before gaining initial access. The most direct and relevant tactic is Initial Access, as it describes the action of gaining access via spearphishing attachments.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
