### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - Whitefly used stolen credentials.
     - They performed lateral movement to expand their control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
     - This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves gathering resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not logically follow lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While using valid accounts can help evade detection, the question specifically asks about what happens after lateral movement, not during it.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement is the tactic of moving through the network to expand control. The question already states that lateral movement has occurred, so this cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the network. After gaining control of additional systems through lateral movement, the next logical step is to collect data from those systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after lateral movement is to collect data from the compromised systems.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
