### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred before the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports and the tricking of developers into running malicious container images.
   - The key points are:
     - Misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
     - Developers being tricked into pulling and running malicious container images.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the idea of developers being tricked into running malicious container images.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1612-Build Image on Host:**
     - This technique involves building a malicious image on the host, which is a step that could follow the initial tricking of developers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL to evade defenses, which could be a part of the malicious container's payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves gathering resources needed for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is a preparatory step but does not directly relate to the specific actions described in the question.
   - **B: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is a final step and does not precede the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target, such as identifying misconfigured Docker API ports. It is a logical step that would occur before the exploitation.
   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While it could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely step before the specific actions described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the attackers first identified the misconfigured Docker API ports, which is a reconnaissance activity. This would allow them to exploit the misconfiguration and trick developers into running malicious container images.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
