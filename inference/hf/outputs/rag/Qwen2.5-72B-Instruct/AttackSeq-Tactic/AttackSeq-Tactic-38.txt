### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to download resources.
   - After the download, GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are activated on the compromised system.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the malware was activated.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves the transfer of tools or other files from a C2 server to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with systems under their control within a target network.
     - While the PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers, the question specifically asks about the activation of the malware, which is more about execution rather than communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's actions to steal and transfer data from the victim's network.
     - The question does not mention any data exfiltration activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's actions to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.
     - The question does not mention any attempts to escalate privileges.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's actions to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data.
     - The activation of GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware is likely to cause impact, such as encrypting files (ransomware) and stealing information (Ursnif).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that the activation of the malware (GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif) would fall under the **Impact** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Impact**
