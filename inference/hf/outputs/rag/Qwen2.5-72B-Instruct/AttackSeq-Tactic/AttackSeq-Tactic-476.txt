### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) uses the DNS protocol to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server.
   - The communication is further obfuscated using substitute ciphers and data is obfuscated for transmission.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using the DNS protocol for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to obfuscate or encrypt data during C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary trying to understand the environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information. This is typically done before or during the initial stages of the attack, not after establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system, which can occur after gaining access and establishing C2 communication. However, the question specifically focuses on the communication method and obfuscation, which are more aligned with the C2 phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. While this can occur after establishing C2 communication, the question does not provide context suggesting lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The use of DNS for communication and the obfuscation techniques described in the question are directly related to the C2 phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the RAT component utilized DNS protocol to communicate with the C2 server, employing substitute ciphers to disguise traffic and obfuscated data for transmission.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
