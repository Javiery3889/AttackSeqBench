### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers executed a malicious DLL using legitimate program executables to launch a backdoor binary blob.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, often using a legitimate program executable. This is a form of both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001):** This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is also a form of persistence.

   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain access to a system. Since the question mentions that the malicious DLL has already been executed, this tactic is not relevant.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. DLL side-loading is a common defense evasion technique.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves the techniques used to run malicious code. The question already states that the malicious DLL has been executed, so this tactic is not the next step.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand the attacker's control. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate next step after executing a malicious DLL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question asks about the tactic that occurred after the execution of the malicious DLL, and considering the related TTPs, the most plausible next step is **Defense Evasion**. This is because the attackers are likely trying to avoid detection and maintain persistence after executing the malicious DLL.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
