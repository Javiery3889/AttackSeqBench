### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained via a spear phishing email delivering a CAB archive impersonating a NIST document.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after gaining initial access and before employing obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear phishing with an attachment to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the tactic that describes the initial entry point of the attack, which is already mentioned in the question. Therefore, it cannot be the answer since the question asks for the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious documents. This typically occurs before the initial access, not after.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, it is typically a pre-attack activity and not a step that would occur after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. After gaining initial access via a spear phishing email, the next logical step would be to execute the payload (the CAB archive) to carry out the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access via a spear phishing email would be the execution of the malicious payload.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
