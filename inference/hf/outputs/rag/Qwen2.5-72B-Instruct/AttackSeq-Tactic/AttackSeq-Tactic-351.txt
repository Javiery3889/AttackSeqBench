### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after data collection from an infected iOS device to manage communication with attackers and enable remote updates and module management.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware or move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial part of the question about collecting data from the infected iOS device.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - This tactic is about gathering data from the system, which is already mentioned in the question. However, it does not address the communication and remote management aspects.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It does not fit the context of managing communication and remote updates.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the infected system to control it, manage updates, and perform remote operations. This aligns well with the question's requirement for managing communication and enabling remote updates and module management.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It does not fit the context of managing an already infected device.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the **Command and Control** tactic, as it directly addresses the need for managing communication and enabling remote updates and module management.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
