### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the ProjectM actors delivered payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. It is a logical first step in many attack sequences, as attackers need to understand their target to craft effective spear-phishing emails and identify vulnerable websites for drive-by compromises.
   - **Impact (B):** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or compromise data, which typically occur after initial access has been gained. It is not a plausible step before initial access.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious content. While it is a necessary step, it is often done concurrently with or after reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It is typically used after gaining initial access to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of an attack, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the ProjectM actors delivered payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks is **Reconnaissance**. This is because attackers need to gather information about their targets to craft effective spear-phishing emails and identify vulnerable websites.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
