### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where threat actors:
     - Exploited CVE-2019-0604 in SharePoint to gain initial access.
     - Used webshells to maintain access.
     - Evaded detection by using a .NET loader with a custom Mimikatz variant.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after gaining initial access and before evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic is already mentioned as the first step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources before an attack, such as building infrastructure or gathering information. It does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is a logical step after gaining initial access and before evading detection.
   - **Execution (A):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. It is also a logical step after gaining initial access and before evading detection.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining initial access, the threat actors would likely need to execute their webshells and other malicious code to maintain and expand their presence on the system.
   - Evading detection typically follows the execution of malicious code to avoid being caught.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Execution
