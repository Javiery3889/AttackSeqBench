### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) have collected detailed system information, including IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, such as IP addresses and network interfaces.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, system information, and other data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system owner and user information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the compromised system. While this is a logical next step after collecting data, the question specifically asks for the most likely tactic that occurred **after** the collection of system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. This is a common tactic but is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the system, which has already been described in the question. Therefore, this is not the most likely next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment better. Given that the malware has already collected detailed system information, the next logical step would be to use this information to discover more about the system and network, such as additional systems, user accounts, and network configurations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible next step after collecting detailed system information is to perform further discovery to understand the environment better.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
