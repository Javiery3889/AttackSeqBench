### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a custom backdoor and tools are deployed to execute commands and facilitate remote access.
   - It then mentions that the attackers attempted to blend malicious activities within legitimate network traffic using CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This technique involves naming or placing files, directories, or services in a manner that makes them appear legitimate or benign.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate cloud services or infrastructure to mask the true origin of command and control (C2) traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This is typically done after initial access and before exfiltration or other post-compromise activities. However, the question does not mention any lateral movement activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after the attacker has established a foothold and possibly after lateral movement. The question does not indicate that data exfiltration has occurred yet.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over an extended period. This is often done after initial access and the deployment of backdoors and tools. The question mentions the deployment of a custom backdoor, which is a form of persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a system. This is typically one of the first steps after gaining initial access. The question already mentions the deployment of a custom backdoor and tools, which implies that execution has already occurred.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after deploying the backdoor and tools (which involves execution and persistence), the attackers would then attempt to maintain their access and blend their activities within legitimate network traffic.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attackers are trying to evade detection and hide their infrastructure, which aligns with the tactic of **Persistence**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Persistence
