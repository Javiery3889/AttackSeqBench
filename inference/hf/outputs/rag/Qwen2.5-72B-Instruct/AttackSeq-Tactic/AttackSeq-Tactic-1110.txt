### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities where IRIDIUM conducted preparation activities to boost destructive and intelligence-gathering capacity and sought to identify government and defense-related organizations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Americas as potential targets.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these preparation activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):** This technique involves collecting credentials, which is a common activity during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Resource Development (T1586.002-Email Accounts):** This technique involves developing resources, such as email accounts, which can be used to support future operations.
   - **Discovery (T1614-System Location Discovery):** This technique involves discovering the location of systems, which is typically done after gaining access to a network to understand the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. Given that the preparation activities include identifying potential targets, reconnaissance is a logical next step to gather more detailed information about these targets.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target's systems. While this is a crucial step, it typically follows reconnaissance.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves exploring the target's network to understand its structure and identify valuable assets. This usually occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves stealing data from the target's systems. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle, typically after discovery and other actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of activities described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after preparation activities is **Reconnaissance**. This is because the preparation activities are focused on identifying potential targets, and the next logical step would be to gather more detailed information about these targets.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
