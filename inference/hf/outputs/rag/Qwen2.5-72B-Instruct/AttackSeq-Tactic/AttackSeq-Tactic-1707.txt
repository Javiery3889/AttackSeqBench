### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a phishing email that delivers a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro.
   - The next step involves the use of `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a phishing email with an attachment (in this case, a PowerPoint add-in document) to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a phishing email with a link to a malicious website or file.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) to execute code on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001 and T1566.002):** These techniques describe the initial steps of the attack, where the phishing email is sent and the attachment or link is used to gain access to the system. This is the first step in the sequence.
   - **Execution (T1059.005):** This technique describes the execution of the VBA macro within the PowerPoint add-in document. This is the next logical step after gaining initial access, as the VBA macro is used to execute further malicious activities.
   - **Discovery (T1082, T1016, etc.):** This tactic involves the attacker exploring the system to gather information. This is typically a step that occurs after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload.
   - **Resource Development (T1583, T1584, etc.):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, which is typically done before the attack is launched.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access:** The phishing email is sent and the attachment (PowerPoint add-in document) is opened.
     2. **Execution:** The VBA macro within the document is executed.
     3. **Further Execution:** The `mshta.exe` tool is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - The step that occurs between the initial access and the use of `mshta.exe` is the execution of the VBA macro.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
