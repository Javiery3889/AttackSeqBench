### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Iranian hackers.
   - They gained initial access using spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages.
   - They then used harvested credentials to potentially move laterally within the networks of their targets.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This is a specific type of phishing where the attacker sends spear-phishing emails with links to fake pages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as passwords, from the target. Given that the hackers used harvested credentials to move laterally, it is likely that they first obtained these credentials.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques to steal data from the target. This is not likely to occur before lateral movement, as the attackers would first need to gain deeper access to the network.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. The question states that this occurred after gaining initial access and harvesting credentials.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target network. While discovery can occur at various stages, it is not the most likely immediate step after gaining initial access and before lateral movement.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access** using spear-phishing links.
     2. **Credential Access** to harvest credentials.
     3. **Lateral Movement** using the harvested credentials.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and moving laterally is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer: A: Credential Access
