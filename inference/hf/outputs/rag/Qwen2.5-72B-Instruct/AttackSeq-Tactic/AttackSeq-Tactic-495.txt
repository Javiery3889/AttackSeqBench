### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where cybercriminals have already executed remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine what tactic occurred before the cybercriminals explored the financial systems of the targeted organization.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for reconnaissance purposes.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to collect information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While persistence is important, it is not the most likely next step after gaining credentials and before exploring financial systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. Given that the cybercriminals have already gained credentials, they would likely use these credentials to gather more information about the financial systems before exploring them.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While execution is a critical step, it is typically used to gain initial access or to run additional tools, not to explore financial systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves avoiding detection. While defense evasion is important, it is not the most likely next step after gaining credentials and before exploring financial systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step after gaining credentials is to perform reconnaissance to gather more information about the financial systems.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
