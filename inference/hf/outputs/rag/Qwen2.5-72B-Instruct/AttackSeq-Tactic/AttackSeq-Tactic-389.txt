### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where VBA macros within a malicious Word document are executed, and then scripts from watering hole attacks begin communicating with external servers.
   - The key point is to identify the ATT&CK tactic that best describes the communication with external servers after the execution of the VBA macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This indicates that the execution of VBA macros is part of the initial attack vector.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic is already covered by the execution of the VBA macros. The question is asking about what happens after the execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**: This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. The question does not mention any impact at this stage.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure. The question specifically mentions communication with external servers, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to the system, such as phishing or drive-by downloads. The VBA macros are part of the initial access, but the question is asking about what happens after the initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the execution of the VBA macros, the scripts from the watering hole attacks begin communicating with external servers, which is a clear indication of the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
