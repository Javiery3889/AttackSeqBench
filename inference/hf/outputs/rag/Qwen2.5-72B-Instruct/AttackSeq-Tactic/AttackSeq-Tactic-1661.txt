### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware actors have collected email accounts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI and are now sending the collected data to their infrastructure through a POST web request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data from remote email accounts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data from local email accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques used to gain an initial foothold in a network. This does not fit the scenario of sending collected data to an infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques used to communicate with and control compromised systems. While T1071.003 (Mail Protocols) is related to command and control, the scenario specifically mentions sending collected data, which is more aligned with exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques used to steal and send data from a compromised system to an attacker's infrastructure. This fits the scenario of sending collected email data through a POST web request.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques used to gather data from a compromised system. While the initial collection of email accounts is part of the scenario, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is sending the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after collecting email accounts, the malware actors are performing exfiltration by sending the collected data to their infrastructure through a POST web request.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
