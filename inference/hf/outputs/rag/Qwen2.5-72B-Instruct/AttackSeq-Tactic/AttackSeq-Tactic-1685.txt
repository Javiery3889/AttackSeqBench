### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary has already obtained initial access through compromised VPN accounts.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine what tactic occurred before the adversary engaged in discovery activities using tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves the adversary using tools to enumerate and analyze logs, which aligns with the use of PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves the adversary attempting to remove or alter indicators of their presence, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering running processes on the system, which is another form of discovery activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. However, the question states that the adversary has already obtained initial access through compromised VPN accounts, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the system and network. The use of PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs is a discovery activity, and the related TTPs (T1654-Log Enumeration and T1057-Process Discovery) support this.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before initial access, not after.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversary engaged in discovery activities after obtaining initial access. The use of PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs is a discovery activity, and the related TTPs support this.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
