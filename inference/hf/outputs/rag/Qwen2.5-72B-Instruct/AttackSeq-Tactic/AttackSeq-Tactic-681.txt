### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Volatile Cedar gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly facing web server.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved using the technique T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic is already described in the question as the initial step where the attacker gains access to the system. Therefore, it cannot be the answer to what happens after initial access.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources and infrastructure before an attack. It is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of what happens after gaining initial access.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely need to execute some form of code to maintain control or further their objectives.
   - **Persistence (A):** This tactic involves establishing a foothold in the system to ensure continued access. After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely want to ensure they can maintain access over time.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that would occur after gaining initial access is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: A: Persistence**
