### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Turla used stolen credentials during Initial Access and before obtaining administrative rights on the Microsoft Exchange servers for Privilege Escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This indicates that Turla used valid credentials to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This indicates that Turla used valid credentials to escalate privileges, likely to gain administrative rights.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation:** This is the final step in the sequence, where Turla obtains administrative rights. It cannot be the tactic that occurs between Initial Access and Privilege Escalation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code or commands. While it could be part of the attack, it is not necessarily the next step after Initial Access and before Privilege Escalation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, where Turla gains access using stolen credentials. It cannot be the tactic that occurs after Initial Access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. It is a logical step after gaining initial access and before escalating privileges, as the attacker would need to understand the environment to effectively escalate privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after Initial Access and before Privilege Escalation is Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
