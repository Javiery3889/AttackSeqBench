### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Machete initially gains access through spearphishing emails.
   - After gaining initial access, a downloader is used to install backdoor components on the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation (T1068) involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This typically occurs after initial access and the installation of backdoor components, but it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access and installing a backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access (T1566) is the tactic that describes the initial entry point into the system. Since the question already states that initial access has been gained through spearphishing, this answer choice does not fit the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (T1071) involves establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to control it. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access and installing a backdoor, as the attacker needs to communicate with the backdoor to control the system.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution (T1059) involves running malicious code on the system. This is a step that occurs during the initial access phase, but the question specifically mentions the use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which is more aligned with the Command and Control phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access and installing backdoor components is establishing Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
