### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the adversaries gathered system information using 'GetStringValue' and 'ZwGetContextThread'.
   - The execution activities mentioned are using 'cmd.exe' with the '/C' switch and 'powershell' scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts and commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. While it is a crucial first step, it typically involves techniques like spear-phishing, drive-by downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities. The execution activities mentioned (using 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell') are more likely to occur after initial access has been gained.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is relevant, the question specifically asks about the sequence leading to gathering system information, which is more aligned with another tactic.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. The activities mentioned (using 'GetStringValue' and 'ZwGetContextThread') are consistent with discovery activities, as they are used to gather system information.
   - **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is not directly related to the execution activities or the gathering of system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversaries performed execution activities (using 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell') and then moved on to discovery activities to gather system information.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
