### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers dump Windows cached password hashes, potentially crack the passwords, and then use these credentials to traverse the network and search for servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials:** This technique involves extracting cached domain credentials from the Windows operating system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.002-Password Cracking:** This technique involves using various methods to crack the extracted passwords.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement (T1021) involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This fits well with the scenario where attackers use the cracked credentials to traverse the network and search for servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery (T1046) involves gathering information about the network and systems. While this is a necessary step, it typically occurs before or in conjunction with Lateral Movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access (T1003, T1110) involves obtaining credentials, which has already been described in the question. This is a prerequisite step, not the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection (T1005) involves gathering data from the target system. This is a step that might occur after Lateral Movement but is not the immediate next step described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**. After obtaining and cracking the credentials, the attackers would use these credentials to move laterally through the network to find and access servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.

**Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement**
