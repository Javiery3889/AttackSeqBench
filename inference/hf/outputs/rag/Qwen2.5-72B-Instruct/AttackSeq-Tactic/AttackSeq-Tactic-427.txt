### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker uses the victim's environment to establish contact with C2 servers via legitimate websites like GitHub and encodes binary files during command execution.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely follows this stage of the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services (like GitHub) to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring additional tools or malware to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the victim's system and sending it to the attacker. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate next step after establishing C2 and transferring tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of the victim's system. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and not the immediate next step after C2 and tool transfer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, which is typically a pre-attack stage. This does not fit the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim's system and network. After establishing C2 and transferring tools, the next logical step is to discover more about the environment to plan further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step is to perform Discovery to gather more information about the victim's environment.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
