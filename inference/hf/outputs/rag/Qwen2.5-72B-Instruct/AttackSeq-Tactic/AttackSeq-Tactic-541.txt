### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the NewPass agent has established communication with a command-and-control (C2) server and is using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.
   - The key points are:
     - Communication with the C2 server.
     - Use of a custom encryption algorithm.
     - HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt data sent to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control:**
     - This choice aligns with the TTPs provided. The use of web protocols (HTTP POST requests) and symmetric cryptography to communicate with the C2 server are both part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and sending data out of the network. While the communication with the C2 server could be a step towards exfiltration, the question specifically focuses on the communication and encryption, which are more aligned with Command and Control.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the network and systems. The question does not mention any discovery activities, so this choice is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. The question does not mention any data collection activities, so this choice is also less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the C2 server and used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
