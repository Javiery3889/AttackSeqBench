### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers harvested credentials using the Responder tool and then established network share and system information enumeration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the enumeration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information about the network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning the LLMNR and NBT-NS protocols to capture and relay credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. The related TTP (T1040-Network Sniffing) is listed under both Discovery and Credential Access. However, the question specifically mentions harvesting credentials, which is more aligned with Credential Access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. It is not directly related to the sequence of harvesting credentials and then enumerating network shares.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The related TTPs (T1040-Network Sniffing and T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay) are directly related to harvesting credentials, which is the first step in the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Credential Access tactic occurred before the attackers established network share and system information enumeration.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
