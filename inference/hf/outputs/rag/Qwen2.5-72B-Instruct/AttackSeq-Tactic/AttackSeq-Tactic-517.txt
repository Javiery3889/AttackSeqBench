### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker has already ensured persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - The next step in the sequence is the communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with control servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources needed for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence** - This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. The question already states that persistence has been established by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. While discovery can occur at various stages, it is not the most likely tactic to occur immediately before the communication with control servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
