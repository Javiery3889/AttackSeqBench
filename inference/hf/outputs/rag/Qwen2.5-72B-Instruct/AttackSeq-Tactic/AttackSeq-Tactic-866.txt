### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the BlackEnergy dropper established persistence through a LNK file in the system startup folder.
   - The key points are:
     - The dropper has already established persistence.
     - The persistence method used is a LNK file in the system startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009 - Shortcut Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying shortcuts (LNK files) to execute malicious code when the shortcut is accessed.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves adding a program to the system's startup folder or registry run keys to ensure it runs at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique is the same as the one for Privilege Escalation but is specifically for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the initial methods used to gain entry into a system. Since the dropper has already established persistence, this tactic is not relevant.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a system. The question already states that persistence has been established, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. After establishing persistence, the next logical step is to establish command and control to manage the compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the system. While this is a common next step, it typically follows command and control to ensure the adversary can manage the data collection process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after establishing persistence is to establish command and control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
