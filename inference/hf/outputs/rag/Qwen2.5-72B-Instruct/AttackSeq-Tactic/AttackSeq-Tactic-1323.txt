### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Earth Wendigo.
   - The sequence includes executing malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies.
   - The next step is intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to web applications.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking browser sessions to collect information or perform actions on behalf of the user.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it doesn't directly fit the sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques to gain entry into a network. This is typically the first step in an attack and doesn't fit the sequence where the attacker is already manipulating session keys and cookies.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to a system. While this could be relevant, it doesn't directly fit the sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques to gather data from the victim's system. The technique T1185-Browser Session Hijacking is part of the Collection tactic, which fits the sequence of actions described. After manipulating session keys and cookies, the attacker would likely use browser session hijacking to collect more information, such as intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described, the most plausible answer is **D: Collection**.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
