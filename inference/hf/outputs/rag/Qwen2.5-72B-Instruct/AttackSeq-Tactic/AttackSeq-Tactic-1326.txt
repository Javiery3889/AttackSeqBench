### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Earth Wendigo establishes a WebSocket connection to control a JavaScript backdoor and reads emails from a webmail server.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely follows this sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the WebSocket connection is used for command and control, which is a method for adversaries to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This indicates that JavaScript is used to execute commands on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This is already part of the initial sequence where the WebSocket connection is established for command and control. It is not a subsequent step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is typically an early stage and not a follow-up to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it could follow the initial compromise, the question does not provide context suggesting the need for lateral movement after reading emails.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. Given that the backdoor is reading emails from the webmail server, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after reading emails from the webmail server is to exfiltrate the data.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
