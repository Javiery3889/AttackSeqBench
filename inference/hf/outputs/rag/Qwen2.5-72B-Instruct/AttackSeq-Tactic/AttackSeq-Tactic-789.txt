### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus Group:
     - They escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.
     - They then collected information about users, network settings, and processes using system utilities like `net user` and `tasklist.exe`.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using local accounts to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:**
     - This technique involves discovering local accounts on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands or exfiltrate data. It is typically used after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold, but it doesn't fit well between privilege escalation and information collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While it can occur after privilege escalation, it is not a necessary step before information collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the initial action, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It can occur after privilege escalation and before information collection, as the attackers might want to ensure their actions are not detected while they gather information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between privilege escalation and information collection is **Defense Evasion**. This is because the attackers would likely want to avoid detection while they gather information.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
