### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk.
   - SharpHound and PowerSploit are tools used for network discovery and mapping, which align with the Discovery tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which is a key part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves preventing or reducing the generation of artifacts or indicators that might be used to detect or analyze an adversary's activities, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation** (Tactic: Privilege Escalation): This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network. While it is a common step in an attack, it is not directly related to the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** (Tactic: Discovery): This tactic involves gathering information from a system or network. SharpHound and PowerSploit are specifically used for network discovery and mapping, which aligns directly with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution** (Tactic: Execution): This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. While it is a necessary step to run SharpHound and PowerSploit, the question is asking about what occurred before the discovery process.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access** (Tactic: Credential Access): This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While it is often a prerequisite for discovery, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
