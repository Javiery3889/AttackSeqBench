### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Deep Panda.
   - The initial access was achieved by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The next step was ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating the `msupdate2` service.
   - We need to determine what ATT&CK tactic likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
     - **T1133 - External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access, which could also be relevant.
   - **Persistence:**
     - **T1133 - External Remote Services:** This technique can also be used for persistence by maintaining access through external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the final step described in the question, where the backdoor is copied and a service is created to ensure persistence. It does not fit the sequence as the step before ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code. After gaining initial access, the threat actor would likely need to execute the backdoor to establish a foothold before ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While it is a common early step, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. After gaining initial access, the threat actor would likely need to discover the environment to understand where to place the backdoor and how to ensure persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible step between gaining initial access and ensuring persistence is **Discovery**. The threat actor would need to understand the environment to effectively place the backdoor and create the service.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
