### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurs when Scote malware retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware is using evasion techniques.
     - It retrieves information from web services (Pastebin, Google+).
     - The purpose is to establish communications with its servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver, which is a method where the malware retrieves a list of command and control (C2) servers from a web service or other online resource.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services (like Pastebin, Google+, etc.) to host C2 infrastructure or to communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - While the malware uses evasion techniques, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs when it retrieves information to establish communications. Defense Evasion is more about avoiding detection and analysis, not about establishing C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before an attack. The question is about the malware's actions after it has already been deployed and is trying to establish C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This is the most relevant choice. The malware is retrieving information from web services to establish communication with its servers, which is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing and sending data out of the network. The question is about establishing communication, not about data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware is using the Command and Control tactic to establish communication with its servers by retrieving information from web services.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
