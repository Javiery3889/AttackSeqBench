### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28, starting with the preparation of infrastructure by registering fake domains and deploying spearphishing domains.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these preparatory actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves registering domains to support future operations, which aligns with the preparatory actions described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, which is a potential goal of the attack but not necessarily the next step after infrastructure preparation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves moving data out of the target network. While this could be a later step, it is not the most immediate next step after preparing infrastructure.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining access to the target network. After preparing the infrastructure, the next logical step would be to use the spearphishing domains to gain initial access to the target.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This would typically follow initial access.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions within the target network. This would typically follow initial access and command and control.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence of events is:
     1. **Resource Development (T1583.001-Domains):** Registering fake domains and deploying spearphishing domains.
     2. **Initial Access (B):** Using the spearphishing domains to gain access to the target network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after preparing the infrastructure is to gain initial access to the target network.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
