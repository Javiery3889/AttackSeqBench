### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Bankshot implant has already evaded detection and persisted on the victim's network.
   - The implants are disguised as ZIP files and are communicating with hardcoded control servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499.004 - Application or System Exploitation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or systems to cause an impact, such as denial of service or data corruption. However, this is not directly relevant to the communication with control servers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036 - Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious files or processes to avoid detection. This is highly relevant to the implants being disguised as ZIP files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly describe the communication with control servers.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. Again, this is not directly related to the communication with control servers.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The implants being disguised as ZIP files align with the T1036 technique (Masquerading), which is a form of defense evasion.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the compromised system. The implants communicating with hardcoded control servers is a clear example of C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the implants communicating with hardcoded control servers, is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
