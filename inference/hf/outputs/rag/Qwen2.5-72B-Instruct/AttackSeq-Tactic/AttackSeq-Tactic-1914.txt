### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where NanHaiShu (a malware) communicated system information to its C&C servers through HTTP POST requests and then switched to a Chinese IP address for dynamic DNS-based Command and Control.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails or is detected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network. This could include identifying system information, network topology, and other details that might be useful for further actions.
     - While discovery is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the initial communication with C&C servers, not immediately before switching to a fallback channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves the adversary establishing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up C&C servers, domains, and other resources.
     - This tactic is more about the preparation phase and is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system, which could include system information.
     - This is a plausible candidate because the malware is communicating system information to the C&C server, which suggests that it has already collected this information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves the adversary maintaining control over the compromised system, which includes communicating with the C&C server.
     - The question already mentions that the malware is communicating with the C&C server, so this tactic is already in progress. The question is asking about what happened before this communication.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware first collected system information (Collection) and then communicated this information to the C&C server.
   - After the initial communication, the malware switched to a fallback channel (Command and Control).

### Final Answer: C: Collection
