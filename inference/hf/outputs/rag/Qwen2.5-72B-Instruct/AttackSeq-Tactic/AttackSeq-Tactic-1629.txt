### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the malware Grabit uses keylogging to collect credentials (usernames and passwords).
   - The next step in the sequence is to enable the malware's 'call home' functionality over obvious channels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is used to capture user input, such as keystrokes, to gather credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also listed under the Credential Access tactic, indicating that the keylogging is used to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - After collecting credentials, the next logical step for the malware is to establish a communication channel with the attacker's server to exfiltrate the collected data and receive further commands.
     - This aligns with the 'call home' functionality described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic is already part of the initial keylogging step, so it doesn't fit as the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems, which is not relevant to the 'call home' functionality.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the 'call home' functionality over obvious channels.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after collecting credentials, the malware would use the Command and Control (C2) tactic to establish a communication channel with the attacker's server.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
