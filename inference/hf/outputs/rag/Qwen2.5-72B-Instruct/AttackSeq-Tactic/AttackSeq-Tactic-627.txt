### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that the attacker has already established command and control (C2) channels to maintain communication with the compromised network.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur to complete the mission successfully.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over the compromised network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves having backup communication methods in case the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and transferring data from the compromised network to an external location. This is a common final step in many cyber attacks, especially after the attacker has established and maintained C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is already established according to the question. The related TTPs also focus on maintaining and ensuring the reliability of C2 channels, not on initiating new C2 activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised network. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before or during the establishment of C2, not after.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While important, it is generally a continuous process throughout the attack, not a final step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context provided, the most plausible next step after establishing and maintaining C2 channels is to exfiltrate the collected data to complete the mission successfully.

**Final Answer: A: Exfiltration**
