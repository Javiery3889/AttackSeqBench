### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers established Command and Control (C2) using stealth methods like backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling.
   - The focus is on what happens after the C2 is established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic, which is a method to maintain stealth in C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests and responses to communicate with a C2 server, which is another stealth method for maintaining C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves gathering resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and C2 establishment, not after.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control** - This is the tactic that is already established in the question. The question asks what happens after C2 is established, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to additional systems or accounts. This is a plausible next step after establishing C2, as attackers often need to move laterally within the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems, such as data destruction or denial of service. While this can occur after C2, it is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after other objectives like data exfiltration are achieved.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after establishing C2 using stealth methods is to gain additional access, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
