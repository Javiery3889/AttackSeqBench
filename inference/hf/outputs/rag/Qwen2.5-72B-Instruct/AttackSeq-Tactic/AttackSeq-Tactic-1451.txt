### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where SkinnyBoy enumerated directories (Discovery phase) and then sent base64 encoded data to a C2 server (Command and Control phase).
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two phases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not likely to occur between directory enumeration and data exfiltration.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. After discovering file and directory paths, the next logical step would be to collect the data from those paths.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described, which focuses on data discovery and exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system. While it is part of the sequence, it is more likely to occur after the data is collected and encoded.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after discovering the directories, the adversary would collect the data from those directories before encoding and exfiltrating it to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
