### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Taidoor attackers have established communication with C&C servers using RC4-encrypted HTTP requests.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves uploading files from infected machines.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to encrypt C&C communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it does not directly relate to the described action of uploading files from infected machines.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While the initial communication with the C&C server falls under this tactic, the question is asking about the next step, which is uploading files.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial entry into the system. The scenario already assumes that the attackers have established communication with the C&C server, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from the compromised system to an external location. Uploading files from infected machines to the C&C server is a clear example of data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after establishing communication with the C&C servers, the attackers used this connection to exfiltrate files from the infected machines.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
