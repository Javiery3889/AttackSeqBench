### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers gain initial access through phishing emails, create backdoors, and then leverage control weaknesses in the Windows network for lateral movement to compromise the Enterprise Admin account.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the lateral movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration:** Exfiltration is the process of stealing data and sending it out of the network. This typically occurs after the attackers have already gained access and moved laterally to the desired location. Therefore, it is not a plausible choice for the tactic that occurred before lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement:** This is the tactic that the question explicitly mentions as occurring after gaining initial access and creating backdoors. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it is typically part of the initial access phase or immediately after gaining access, but not necessarily before lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This is the most plausible choice. The question states that the attackers gained initial access through phishing emails, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic. The related TTPs also support this, as they mention techniques for initial access using valid accounts and domain accounts.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Initial Access
