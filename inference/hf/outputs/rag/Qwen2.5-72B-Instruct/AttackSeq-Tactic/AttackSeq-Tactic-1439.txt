### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses impersonated login pages to collect credentials from targeted personnel. After collecting the credentials, the attacker redirects the victim to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the redirection to the YouTube clip.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to impersonated login pages to collect credentials.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing links to gather information about the target before the actual attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It is typically used after gaining initial access and is not relevant to the initial credential collection phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. The related TTP (T1598.003) suggests that spearphishing links can be used for reconnaissance, but the question specifically mentions the use of impersonated login pages to collect credentials, which is more aligned with initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target. The related TTP (T1566.002) directly supports this, as it describes using spearphishing links to collect credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network and systems. While discovery can occur after initial access, it is not the most likely tactic to occur immediately before the redirection to a YouTube clip.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **C: Credential Access**. The use of impersonated login pages to collect credentials is a clear example of the Credential Access tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
