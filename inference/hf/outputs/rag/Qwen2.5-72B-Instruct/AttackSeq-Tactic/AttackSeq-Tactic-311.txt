### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is established through email attachments containing malicious VBA macros.
   - The next step involves the Sednit's Delphi downloader sending gathered information to a C&C server using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using email attachments to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) macros to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before initial access is established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is not relevant to the sequence described, which focuses on initial access and execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. The use of VBA macros to execute commands and the subsequent use of `cmd.exe` to gather system information aligns with the Execution tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access has already been established through the spearphishing attachment. The question is asking about the next step in the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after initial access is established, the next step is the execution of the malicious code to gather information and send it to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
