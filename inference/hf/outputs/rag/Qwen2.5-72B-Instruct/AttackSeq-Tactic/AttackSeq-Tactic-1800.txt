### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after APT28 used spearphishing domains impersonating financial institutions to prepare for their attack.
   - The key points are:
     - APT28 used spearphishing domains.
     - The domains impersonated financial institutions.
     - The action was part of the preparation for the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites or files to gain initial access to a target's system.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:**
     - This technique involves stealing financial information or funds from the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is typically used after gaining initial access to maintain control over the compromised system. However, the question is about what happened after the preparation phase, which is more aligned with gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials from the target. While this can occur after initial access, the question specifically mentions the preparation phase, which is more aligned with gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is more of a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of what happens after the preparation phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques to gain entry into the target's system. The use of spearphishing links (T1566.002) is a common method for initial access. Given that the question mentions the preparation phase and the use of spearphishing domains, this is the most logical next step.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Initial Access
