### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Packrat:
     - Evaded antivirus detection using obfuscation techniques and runtime packers.
     - Used its infrastructure to host domains communicating with malware on targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing**
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
   - These TTPs confirm that the initial steps involved evading detection by using obfuscation and packing techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they have compromised. This typically happens after gaining initial access and before setting up command and control.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a logical next step after evading detection and setting up the infrastructure to communicate with the malware.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion is already part of the initial steps described in the question (using obfuscation and packing techniques).
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised system. This typically happens after establishing command and control and understanding the environment.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     - **Initial Step:** Evading detection using obfuscation and packing techniques (Defense Evasion).
     - **Next Step:** Using infrastructure to host domains communicating with malware (Command and Control).
   - Therefore, the most logical next step after evading detection and setting up the infrastructure is to establish command and control.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
