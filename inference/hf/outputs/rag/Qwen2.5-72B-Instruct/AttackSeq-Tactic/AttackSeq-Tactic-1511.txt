### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong who received a phishing email containing a malicious RAR archive.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the phishing email was received but before the attackers created two separate infection chains using executables within the archive.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves compressing data into an archive format, which is not directly relevant to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment, which is directly relevant to the initial step of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance:** Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This would typically occur before the phishing email is sent, not after.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** Credential Access involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target. This would typically occur after the initial access is gained, not before the infection chains are created.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. This would occur after the initial access is gained and the malicious RAR archive is opened.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** Initial Access involves gaining entry to the target system, which in this case is achieved through the spearphishing email with the malicious RAR archive.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. The activists receive a phishing email (Initial Access).
     2. The activists open the malicious RAR archive (Initial Access).
     3. The attackers create two separate infection chains using executables within the archive (Execution).

   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the phishing email was received but before the infection chains were created is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
