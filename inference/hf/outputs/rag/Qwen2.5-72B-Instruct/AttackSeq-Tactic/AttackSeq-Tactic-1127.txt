### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT42:
     - They used custom malware capable of logging keystrokes and stealing logins for privilege escalation.
     - They then conducted internal reconnaissance by browsing contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves logging keystrokes to collect information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves logging keystrokes to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending data out of the network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has collected the data they need.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is a common tactic, it is not specifically mentioned in the sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial access involves gaining entry into the network. This is typically the first step in an attack, not something that occurs after keylogging and before internal reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential access involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question mentions that the malware was used to steal logins for privilege escalation, which aligns with the credential access tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT42 used custom malware to log keystrokes and steal logins (Credential Access) before conducting internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
