### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in Mustang Panda's campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Leveraging obfuscated loaders to execute the Korplug variant.
     - Collecting extensive data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from various sources, including removable media (T1025).
     - However, the question states that data collection occurs after the execution of the Korplug variant.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis.
     - While obfuscated loaders are a form of defense evasion, the question asks about the tactic that occurs after the execution of the Korplug variant and before data collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network.
     - Discovery is a logical step between gaining initial access and collecting data, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to know what data to collect.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurs between the execution of the Korplug variant and the collection of data is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
