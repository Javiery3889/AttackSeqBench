### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor StellarParticle.
   - The actions are:
     1. Renaming systems to match the victim's naming convention.
     2. Using AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This technique involves renaming systems or files to blend in with legitimate system names to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.002-Domain Account:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about domain accounts, which can be used to identify potential targets for credential access or privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Renaming systems to match the victim's naming convention:**
     - This action aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic, specifically the **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** technique.
   - **Using AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory:**
     - This action aligns with the **Discovery** tactic, specifically the **T1087.002-Domain Account** technique, as it involves gathering information about domain accounts.

4. **Determine the Tactic Between the Two Actions:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the renaming of systems and before the use of AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets.
   - The renaming of systems is a **Defense Evasion** technique.
   - The use of AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets is a **Discovery** technique.
   - The most logical tactic that would occur between these two actions is **Discovery**. This is because after the threat actor has successfully blended in with the victim's environment, they would likely start gathering information about the environment to plan their next steps.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Discovery
