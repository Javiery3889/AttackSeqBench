### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already ensured persistence by setting registry keys and deploying a DLL to load on Windows startup.
   - The next step in the sequence is to enable communication with the adversary's infrastructure using HTTP or HTTPS requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to execute a malicious payload.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to ensure that a malicious payload is executed at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is similar to the previous one and is used to ensure persistence by modifying registry run keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network and understand the environment. It does not align with the described sequence of enabling communication with the adversary's infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence** - This tactic has already been addressed in the question with the setting of registry keys and deployment of a DLL. It does not fit the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Enabling communication with the adversary's infrastructure using HTTP or HTTPS requests is a key part of this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs earlier in the attack sequence, not after ensuring persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after ensuring persistence, the next step is to establish command and control to enable communication with the adversary's infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
