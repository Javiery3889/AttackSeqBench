### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the adversary explored the target network to locate relevant systems using Discovery techniques.
   - The key phrase is "after the adversary explored the target network to locate relevant systems using Discovery."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary identifying remote systems on the network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary identifying active network connections on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain and use credentials to gain access to systems. This is typically a step that occurs before or during the initial access and can be used to facilitate further actions like lateral movement. However, it is not a direct next step after discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery is the tactic that the adversary is already performing. The question asks what happens after discovery, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. After discovering the network and identifying relevant systems, the next logical step is to move laterally to gain access to those systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques to run malicious code. While this can occur at various stages, it is not typically the immediate next step after discovery. Discovery is often followed by lateral movement to gain access to more systems before executing further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that after the adversary has explored the network and located relevant systems using Discovery techniques, the next step is to perform Lateral Movement to gain access to those systems.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
