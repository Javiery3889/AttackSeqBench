### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of backdoor malware and before gathering information and credentials on Windows systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying software installed on a system, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography:** This technique involves using steganography to hide malicious content, which is part of the defense evasion phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - C2 involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. This typically occurs after initial access and before or during the execution of other tactics.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is a crucial step, it is often used to maintain persistence and avoid detection after initial access and during the execution of other tactics.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before gathering specific information and credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development:**
     - Resource development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This typically occurs before the initial compromise.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence described in the question, the most logical step after executing backdoor malware and before gathering information and credentials is to discover the environment and the software installed on the system. This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
