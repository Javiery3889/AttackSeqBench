### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10:
     - Conducted internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
     - Leveraged shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations to understand the network topology.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials for use in other attacks. While this is a common step in many attack sequences, the question specifically mentions internal reconnaissance and mapping out the network, which is more aligned with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. The related TTP T1046 (Network Service Discovery) directly supports this choice. After mapping out the network, the next logical step would be to discover more about the network services and configurations.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit between internal reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system. While this is a common step, the question does not indicate a need for privilege escalation between the reconnaissance and lateral movement stages.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred after the internal reconnaissance and before the lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
