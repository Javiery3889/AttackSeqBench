### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Tuyul botnet maintains persistence through a periodically downloaded bash script named 'cron'.
   - The key point is that the botnet is ensuring its continued presence on victim systems, which is a characteristic of the **Persistence** tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs to execute scripts or commands at specific intervals.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique is specifically mentioned again, reinforcing the use of cron jobs for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the botnet might use defense evasion techniques, the question specifically focuses on maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the botnet's command and control server. The question does not mention communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques to gain initial access to a system. The question is about maintaining presence, not gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain a foothold in the system, which aligns perfectly with the use of a periodically downloaded bash script named 'cron' to ensure continued presence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
