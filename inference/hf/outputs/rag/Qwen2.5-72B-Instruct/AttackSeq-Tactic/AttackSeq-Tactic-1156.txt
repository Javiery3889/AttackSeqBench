### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where T9000 has already communicated with a C2 server using encrypted traffic to relay collected information.
   - The focus is on the next step in the attack sequence, which involves securely moving the stolen data out of the victim environment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves transferring data at specific times to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves using the same C2 channel that was used for command and control to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions within the victim environment. It is not relevant to the secure movement of stolen data out of the environment.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim environment. It is not relevant to the secure movement of stolen data out of the environment.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While the initial communication with the C2 server is mentioned, the question is about the next step, which is exfiltration.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves moving data out of the victim environment. The related TTPs (T1029 and T1041) specifically describe techniques for exfiltrating data, which aligns with the question's focus on securely moving stolen data out of the environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker would use the Exfiltration tactic to securely move the stolen data out of the victim environment.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
