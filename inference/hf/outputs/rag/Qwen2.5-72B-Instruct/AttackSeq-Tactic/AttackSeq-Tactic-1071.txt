### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker first exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
   - After gaining elevated privileges, the attacker adds a Run registry key to achieve a foothold.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to ensure that a program runs automatically when the system starts, which is a form of persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the context of adding a Run registry key for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. Adding a Run registry key is a common method to ensure that a malicious program runs every time the system starts, which aligns with the described action.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from a system and transferring it to an attacker-controlled location. It does not fit the context of adding a Run registry key.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation** - While the initial step involved privilege escalation, the question asks about the next step, which is adding a Run registry key. This is more aligned with persistence rather than further privilege escalation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attacker achieved persistence by adding a Run registry key.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
