### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Dragonfly attackers:
     - They gathered credentials and system information from Windows systems during the discovery phase.
     - They then used remote desktop protocol (RDP) to move laterally within the victim network.
   - We need to determine what tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:**
     - This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1187-Forced Authentication:**
     - This technique involves forcing authentication to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Initial Access:**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the network, which typically occurs before the discovery phase.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to expand access, which typically occurs after gathering credentials and system information.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the network, which has already been mentioned as occurring before the use of RDP.
   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which fits the sequence described in the question. After gathering credentials and system information, the attackers would need to access these credentials to use RDP for lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between gathering credentials and system information and using RDP for lateral movement is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
