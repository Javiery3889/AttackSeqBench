### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers use spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers use an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers employed the undocumented Word feature to gather information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the initial access is gained.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. This is a plausible step after gaining initial access, but it doesn't specifically align with the use of an undocumented Word feature to gather information.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system, which is already described in the question as being achieved through spear phishing with OLE2 format documents.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. This typically occurs after initial access and execution.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question states that the attackers used spear phishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to execute code or perform actions on the victim's system, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic.
   - The use of an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer is a form of execution, as it involves running a specific feature to collect data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Execution
