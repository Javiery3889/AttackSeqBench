### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a banking Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Searching for antivirus and banking-related folders.
     - Collecting system information such as the hostname and OS version.
     - Capturing screenshots and mouse clicks during browsing sessions on banking sites.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the system information collection and the screenshot/mouse click capture.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware searching for security software (antivirus) on the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware collecting system information such as the hostname and OS version.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves the malware capturing screenshots and mouse clicks during browsing sessions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which includes capturing screenshots and mouse clicks. However, this is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the actions of searching for antivirus and banking-related folders and collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which typically occurs before the discovery and collection phases.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack, which typically occurs before the malware is even on the system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the malware first discovering information about the system (antivirus and system information) and then moving on to collect data (screenshots and mouse clicks).
   - The tactic that fits between these two phases is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
