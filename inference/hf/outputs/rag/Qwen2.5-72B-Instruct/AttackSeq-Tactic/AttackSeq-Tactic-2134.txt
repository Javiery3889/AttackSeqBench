### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and before the RoyalDNS backdoor installed itself persistently on the victim's network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the initial access was gained using domain administrator credentials.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This suggests that the domain administrator credentials were used to establish persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the domain administrator credentials were used to evade defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and is communicating with the compromised system. However, the question specifies that the RoyalDNS backdoor installed itself persistently, which is a form of persistence, not C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the tactic of maintaining access to a system over an extended period. The question mentions that the RoyalDNS backdoor installed itself persistently, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this is a crucial step, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred after gaining credentials and before installing the backdoor persistently.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. While this is an important early step, the question specifies that the credentials were already gained and the backdoor was about to be installed persistently.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, the attacker would use these credentials to establish persistence before installing the RoyalDNS backdoor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
