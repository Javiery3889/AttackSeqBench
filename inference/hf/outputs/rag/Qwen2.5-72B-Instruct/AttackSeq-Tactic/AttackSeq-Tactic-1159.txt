### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FastPOS used keylogging and RAM scraping to steal sensitive information, specifically credit card data with valid service codes.
   - The focus is on the immediate transmission of this stolen data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also listed under the Credential Access tactic, indicating that keylogging can be used to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which aligns with the keylogging and RAM scraping described in the question. However, it does not specifically address the transmission of the data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network, which is not relevant to the immediate transmission of stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to send commands and receive data. This is the most relevant tactic for the immediate transmission of stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which is not relevant to the transmission of stolen data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question, is that after the data is collected, it is immediately transmitted to the attacker's infrastructure. This aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
