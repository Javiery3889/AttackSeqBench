### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker identifies installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word and bypasses detection using an undocumented Word feature.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred prior to the bypass during the Freakyshelly targeted attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves using vulnerabilities in software to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying installed software on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques used to gain a foothold in a network. This does not align with the described sequence of identifying software and bypassing detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques used to gather information about the target system. The technique T1518-Software Discovery fits this category, as it involves identifying installed software.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques used to obtain credentials. This does not align with the described sequence of identifying software and bypassing detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques used to avoid detection. The technique T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion fits this category, as it involves bypassing security mechanisms.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves identifying installed software (Discovery) and then bypassing detection (Defense Evasion).
   - The most logical sequence is that the attacker first discovers the installed software (Discovery) and then uses an undocumented feature to bypass detection (Defense Evasion).

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
