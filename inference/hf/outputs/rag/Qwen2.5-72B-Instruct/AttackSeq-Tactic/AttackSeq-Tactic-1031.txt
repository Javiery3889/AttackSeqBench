### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers gain credentials through phishing sites mimicking Instagram's interface, then change account passwords and download all content from the compromised accounts.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers changed account passwords and downloaded content.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using spearphishing to move laterally within a network, but it doesn't directly relate to the initial credential gathering.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials as part of the reconnaissance phase, which is relevant to the initial credential gathering.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is also relevant to the initial credential gathering.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques like T1003-OS Credential Dumping, which is directly related to the initial credential gathering. However, the question specifies that the credentials were gained through phishing, not OS credential dumping.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques like T1589.001-Credentials, which is relevant to the initial credential gathering through phishing. This is the most likely tactic that occurred before the attackers changed account passwords and downloaded content.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, but it doesn't directly relate to the initial credential gathering or the subsequent actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised system, which is relevant to the downloading of content but not to the initial credential gathering.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **B: Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
