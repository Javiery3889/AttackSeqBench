### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where BLACKGEAR gained initial access using fake Japanese documents. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the backdoors connected to C&C servers to wait for commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the download of malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before an attack. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the initial access is gained.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to the target system. This is usually a step that occurs after initial access and execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is also a step that typically occurs after initial access and execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial access involves techniques to gain entry into the target system. The related TTPs (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) clearly indicate that initial access was gained through spearphishing, which aligns with the question's context.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that initial access was gained through spearphishing, and then the backdoors connected to C&C servers to wait for commands.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
