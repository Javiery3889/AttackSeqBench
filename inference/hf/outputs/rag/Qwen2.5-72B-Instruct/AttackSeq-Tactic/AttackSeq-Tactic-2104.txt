### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between scanning the corporate internal network for open ports and exfiltrating the victim’s data using the Nidiran back door.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves scanning the network to identify open ports and services.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data from the victim’s network to the attacker’s control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial part of the attack, it typically occurs before the discovery and exfiltration phases.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim’s network and systems. The related TTP (T1046-Network Service Discovery) directly aligns with the scanning of the network for open ports.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. While this is a common step in many attacks, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim’s system. While this is a necessary step to gain initial access, it typically occurs before the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **B: Discovery**. The scanning of the network for open ports is a clear indication of the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
