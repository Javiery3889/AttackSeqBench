### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before establishing command and control connections to Chinese botnets, after gaining persistence in a Windows XP embedded version.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with the command and control server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves gaining initial access to a system through a drive-by compromise, often via a malicious website or link.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves maintaining persistence by hijacking the DLL search order to ensure the malware is executed every time a specific application is run.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that occurs after the attacker has already established control and is focused on causing damage or disruption. This is not likely to occur before establishing command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. While this can occur before command and control, it is not the most likely immediate step after gaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials to gain further access. This can occur before or after establishing command and control, but it is not the most immediate step after gaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the tactic of maintaining access to the system. The question already states that persistence has been gained, so this is not the correct answer.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question states that persistence has already been gained, the most likely step before establishing command and control would be **Discovery**. The attacker would need to gather information about the system and network to effectively establish command and control connections.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
