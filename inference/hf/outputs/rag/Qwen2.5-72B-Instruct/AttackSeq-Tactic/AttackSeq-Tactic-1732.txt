### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) collected detailed system information, including IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings.
   - After this collection, the malware self-deleted past a hardcoded date to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**
     - This technique involves renaming or placing malware in a location that mimics legitimate files or directories to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the system's network configuration, such as IP addresses and network interfaces.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting information about files and directories on the system, including recursive directory listings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - While the malware self-deleted to avoid detection, which is a form of defense evasion, this action occurred after the collection of system information. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the collection but before the self-deletion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending collected data to an external location. The question does not mention any data being sent out, so this is not the most plausible choice.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential access involves attempting to obtain credentials from the system. The question does not mention any attempts to access credentials, so this is not the most plausible choice.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - The related TTPs T1016 and T1083 both fall under the Discovery tactic. These techniques involve collecting detailed system information, which aligns with the actions described in the question (collecting IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
