### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking and before the attackers stole domain authentication credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique is used to execute malicious code by hijacking the DLL search order of a legitimate application.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique is used to gain higher privileges by hijacking the DLL search order.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique is used to maintain access to the system by hijacking the DLL search order.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system. Since the question states that ShadowPad was already executed via DLL hijacking, Initial Access has already occurred.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system. While DLL hijacking can be used for persistence, the question is asking about what happened after the execution and before credential theft.
   - **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is explicitly mentioned in the question as the next step after the execution of ShadowPad.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running malicious code. The execution of ShadowPad via DLL hijacking has already been mentioned, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking, the attackers then moved to steal domain authentication credentials. Therefore, the tactic that occurred in between is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
