### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the V1 server connected to V2's SMB service to perform sensitive operations during lateral movement.
   - The focus is on the sequence of events leading up to the lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using existing, legitimate services or protocols to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using Server Message Block (SMB) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is typically done after gaining access and before or during lateral movement. It is not a prerequisite for lateral movement.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to support planning future actions. Reconnaissance is often performed before initial access and can help identify targets for lateral movement, but it is not a direct prerequisite for the actual lateral movement.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. Execution is a necessary step to gain control over a system, but it is not a direct prerequisite for lateral movement.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial foothold on a system. Initial access is a prerequisite for any further actions, including lateral movement. Before the V1 server can connect to V2's SMB service, it must have already gained access to the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the V1 server must have gained initial access to the network before it could connect to V2's SMB service for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
