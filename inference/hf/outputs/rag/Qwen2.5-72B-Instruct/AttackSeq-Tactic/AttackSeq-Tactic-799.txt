### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious self-extracting RAR files to achieve initial access.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic occurred after initial access but before command and control was established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is already described in the question as the first step where the attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious RAR files.
   - **Execution (B):** After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the payload (the malicious RAR file) to gain a foothold in the system.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic is mentioned as the final step in the sequence, where the attackers establish communication with their infrastructure.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which can occur at various points in the attack but is not necessarily the immediate next step after initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Initial Access (spear phishing) -> Execution (of the malicious RAR file) -> Command and Control (establishing communication with DynDNS services).
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred after initial access but before command and control is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
