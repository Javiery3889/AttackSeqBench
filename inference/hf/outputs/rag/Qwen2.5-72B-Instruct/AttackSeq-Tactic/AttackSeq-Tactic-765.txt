### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the tactic used by the Darkhotel APT before gaining initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - The focus is on obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves making malicious files or programs appear legitimate by using names or locations that are similar to legitimate ones.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malware to victims.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. It is not directly related to gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is highly relevant to obtaining knowledge of victims' names and places of stay.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target's systems. While it is part of the attack sequence, it is not the initial step of gathering information about the victims.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems. It is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the **Reconnaissance** tactic, as it is the most relevant to obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the initial access.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
