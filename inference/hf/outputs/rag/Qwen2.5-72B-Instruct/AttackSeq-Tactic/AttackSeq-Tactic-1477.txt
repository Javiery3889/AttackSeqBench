### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Duke group using Seaduke malware.
   - The actions include retrieving bot/system information, updating configurations, and securely deleting malware from victim systems using the 'seppuku' function.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1070.004 - File Deletion**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (A):** This tactic involves communicating with the malware to control it. While this might be part of the initial infection or ongoing operations, it does not align with the specific action of securely deleting malware.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim system. While retrieving bot/system information could be part of this, the question specifically mentions the deletion of malware, which is not a collection activity.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The 'seppuku' function, which securely deletes malware, is a clear example of defense evasion. The related TTP (T1070.004 - File Deletion) directly supports this.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves transferring data out of the victim's network. While this might be a subsequent step, the question focuses on the deletion of malware, which is more aligned with defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Duke group used Seaduke to perform defense evasion by securely deleting malware from victim systems.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
