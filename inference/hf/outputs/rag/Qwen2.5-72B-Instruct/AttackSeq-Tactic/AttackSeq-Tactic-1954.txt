### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the OceanLotus backdoor evaded defenses using robust string encoding and custom encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - The key points are:
     - The backdoor has already evaded defenses.
     - It uses robust string encoding and custom encryption.
     - It communicates with a command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
     - This technique involves using encrypted or encoded files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The backdoor has already used robust string encoding and custom encryption to evade defenses, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactics (T1140, T1027.013, T1027).
   - After evading defenses, the next logical step in the attack sequence is to establish and maintain communication with the C2 server.
   - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves communicating with the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control**
     - This is the most logical next step after evading defenses. The backdoor needs to communicate with the C2 server to receive further instructions.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, which typically occurs before the attack is launched.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which can occur after gaining initial access but is not the immediate next step after evading defenses.
   - **D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is typically part of the initial compromise and not the next step after evading defenses.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
