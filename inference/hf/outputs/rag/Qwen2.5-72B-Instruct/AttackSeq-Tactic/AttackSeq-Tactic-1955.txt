### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server.
   - The next step involves using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using a non-standard port for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using a non-standard application layer protocol for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment. The question already states that the attacker has surveyed the victim's computer, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. The question does not indicate any impact actions, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. The related TTPs (T1571 and T1095) both fall under the Command and Control tactic, and they describe the use of non-standard ports and protocols, which aligns with the custom binary protocol and AES encryption on TCP port 443 mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's system. While the question mentions sending information to a remote server, the focus is on the communication method (custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443), which is more indicative of C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443, the most plausible next step is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
