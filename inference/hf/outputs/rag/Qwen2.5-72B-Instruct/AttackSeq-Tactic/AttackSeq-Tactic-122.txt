### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - 'Surtr' ensured persistence by adding registry keys and storing C2 information for execution during system restarts.
     - 'Surtr' then connected to a command and control server to download a stage two component.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves setting up registry keys or startup folder entries to ensure that a malicious program runs automatically when the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):**
     - This is the first action described in the question, where 'Surtr' ensures persistence by adding registry keys.
   - **Command and Control (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels):**
     - This is the second action described in the question, where 'Surtr' connects to a command and control server to download a stage two component.
   - **Collection (C):**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not mentioned in the sequence of actions.
   - **Discovery (D):**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which is also not mentioned in the sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - **Persistence** (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) occurs first.
     - **Command and Control** (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels) occurs next.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after ensuring persistence and before connecting to the command and control server is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
