### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where configuration files are decoded to issue new instructions for targeted DDoS attacks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions hard-coded into the sample.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service:** This technique involves causing a denial of service by overwhelming the target's resources.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files to reveal their true content, which is often used to hide malicious instructions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs before the attacker has a foothold in the system and is not directly related to the decoding of configuration files for DDoS attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is a pre-attack phase and is not directly related to the decoding of configuration files for DDoS attacks.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves the actual execution of the DDoS attack, which is the final stage. The question is asking about what happened before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a plausible answer because the attacker would need to send commands to the KernelBot implants to decode the configuration files and issue new instructions for the DDoS attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions hard-coded into the sample.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
