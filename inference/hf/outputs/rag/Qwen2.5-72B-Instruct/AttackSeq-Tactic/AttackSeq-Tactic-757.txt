### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Emissary Panda group.
   - They performed reconnaissance to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The group identified systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, which is a reconnaissance activity.
   - **Next Step:**
     - After identifying the vulnerable systems, the most logical next step would be to exploit the vulnerability to gain initial access to the system.
     - The related TTPs confirm that T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) is a technique under the Initial Access tactic.
   - **Other Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Privilege Escalation:**
       - This would typically occur after gaining initial access, not immediately after reconnaissance.
     - **B: Lateral Movement:**
       - This would occur after gaining initial access and possibly after privilege escalation.
     - **C: Execution:**
       - This could occur after gaining initial access, but it is not the immediate next step after reconnaissance.
     - **D: Initial Access:**
       - This aligns with the sequence described, as the group would exploit the identified vulnerability to gain initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after reconnaissance is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
