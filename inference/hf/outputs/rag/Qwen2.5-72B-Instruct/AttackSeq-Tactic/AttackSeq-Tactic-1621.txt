### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the group Earth Lusca:
     - Acquired credentials using tools like Mimikatz and the ZeroLogon exploit.
     - Scanned the compromised network environment with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool):** This technique involves acquiring or developing tools to support operations.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):** This technique involves gathering information about credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services):** This technique involves moving through a network to expand access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access. While this is a plausible next step after acquiring credentials, the question specifically mentions scanning the network, which is more aligned with discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network, such as network topology, system configurations, and open ports. Scanning the network with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan is a clear example of discovery.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question already states that credentials were acquired using Mimikatz and ZeroLogon, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves acquiring or developing tools. While the group used tools, the question is about the action of scanning the network, which is more aligned with discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after acquiring credentials, the group scanned the network to discover more information about the environment.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
