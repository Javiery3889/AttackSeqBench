### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021.
   - Initial access was gained by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - The next step in the sequence is achieving persistence using web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique describes how the threat group gained initial access by exploiting a public-facing application (in this case, the Windows IIS server).
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique describes how the threat group achieved persistence by using web shells.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:**
     - Execution (T1059) involves running malicious code. This is a plausible step after gaining initial access, as the threat group would need to execute the web shell or custom malware to achieve persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access (T1555) involves techniques to obtain credentials. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not necessarily a required step between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance (T1592) involves gathering information to plan future actions. This is typically a pre-attack phase and less likely to occur between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access (T1190) is already described in the question as the first step. It cannot be the step between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the threat group executed the web shell or custom malware to achieve persistence. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
