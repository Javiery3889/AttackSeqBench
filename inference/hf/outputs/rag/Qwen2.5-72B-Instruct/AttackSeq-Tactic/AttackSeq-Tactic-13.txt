### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites to distribute "Machete" malware embedded in disguised PowerPoint presentations.
   - The key elements are:
     - Spear-phishing emails
     - Fake blog websites
     - Disguised PowerPoint presentations containing malware

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending emails with links to malicious websites.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:**
     - The techniques mentioned (T1189, T1566.002, T1566.001) all fall under the Initial Access tactic.
     - The question describes methods used to gain initial access to the victim's system, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to a system over time.
     - The question does not mention any methods for maintaining access, so this choice is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection:**
     - Collection involves techniques to gather data from the victim's system.
     - The question does not mention any data collection activities, so this choice is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques to gather information about the target before an attack.
     - The question describes the attack itself, not the pre-attack information gathering, so this choice is less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used Initial Access techniques to gain entry into the victim's system.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
