### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers used a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page.
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of shellcode by exploiting a Use-After-Free (UaF) condition in Google Chrome.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It typically occurs before the initial access, not between the initial access and the exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. Given that the attackers are about to execute shellcode, this is a strong candidate for the tactic that occurs between the initial access and the exploitation.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access and execution, not between initial access and the exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The initial access has already been achieved through the waterhole-style injection, so this is not the correct answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers gained initial access through the waterhole-style injection, then executed shellcode by exploiting a UaF condition in Google Chrome.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred between these two events is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
