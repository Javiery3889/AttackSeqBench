### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlueDelta collected emails by creating a filter in the Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward emails to an attacker-controlled address.
   - The key action here is the creation of a filter to forward emails, which is a form of data collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves the use of email accounts to support the attack, such as creating or compromising email accounts to facilitate further actions.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to collect emails and send them to an attacker-controlled address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial part of many attacks, it typically occurs before or concurrently with data collection, not after.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target system. While discovery can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not typically the next step after setting up email forwarding.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data from the target system to the attacker's system. After setting up an email forwarding rule to collect emails, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the collected emails to the attacker-controlled address.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. While impact can be a goal of an attack, it is not typically the immediate next step after setting up email forwarding.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after setting up an email forwarding rule to collect emails is to exfiltrate the collected data.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
