### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already prepared compromised web servers to host the ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts (part of resource development).
   - The next step is to trick users into executing the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
   - These TTPs all involve DLL Search Order Hijacking, which is a technique used to execute malicious code by placing a malicious DLL in a specific location where the system or application will load it instead of the legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system. However, the question states that the web servers are already compromised, so this tactic is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves the actual execution of the malicious code. DLL Hijacking is a method of execution, so this is a strong candidate.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which is not relevant to the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker, after preparing the web servers, would need to execute the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking. Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
