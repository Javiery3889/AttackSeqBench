### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker has created a PE file and set up a scheduled task to run the binary every minute.
   - The focus is on ensuring the malware remains active, which is a key aspect of maintaining a foothold in the system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the scheduled task can be used to escalate privileges, but the question does not specifically mention privilege escalation.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the scheduled task is used to execute the malware, which is part of the initial execution phase.
   - The question, however, is asking about ensuring the malware remains active, which is more aligned with the concept of persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, which is not relevant to the question of ensuring the malware remains active.
   - **B: Execution:** While the scheduled task is used for execution, the question is more focused on the ongoing nature of the malware's presence, which is better described by persistence.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which is not directly related to ensuring the malware runs every minute.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system, which aligns perfectly with the goal of running the binary every minute to ensure the malware remains active.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Persistence
