### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred between the steps of disguising network traffic and establishing an encrypted command and control communication.
   - The specific actions mentioned are capturing desktop snapshots and accessing running processes on the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves disguising network traffic to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing desktop snapshots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it is relevant to disguising network traffic, it does not directly involve capturing desktop snapshots or accessing running processes.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques used to gain initial access to a system. It is not relevant to the actions of capturing desktop snapshots or accessing running processes.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the system. The technique T1113-Screen Capture is directly related to this tactic, as it involves capturing desktop snapshots.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information before an attack. It is not directly related to the actions of capturing desktop snapshots or accessing running processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific actions mentioned in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the **Collection** tactic, as it directly includes the technique T1113-Screen Capture.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
