### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the Hi-Zor RAT:
     - **String-stacking and double XOR encoding** are used for operations.
     - **Volume Serial Number information** is sent through a secure TLS connection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it during exfiltration or command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **String-stacking and double XOR encoding** are techniques used to obfuscate data, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Sending Volume Serial Number information through a secure TLS connection** is a method of exfiltrating data, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - The sequence of events suggests that the data was first obfuscated (Defense Evasion) and then exfiltrated (Command and Control).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the **Defense Evasion** tactic occurred after the string-stacking and double XOR encoding and before the data was sent through a secure TLS connection.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
