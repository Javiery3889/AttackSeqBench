### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Stuxnet gained access to systems using malicious .LNK files on removable drives but before the worm executed its malicious code on both local and remote systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in a system. The question states that Stuxnet has already gained access using malicious .LNK files on removable drives, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves spreading the malware to other systems within the network. The related TTPs mention T1091-Replication Through Removable Media under Lateral Movement, which aligns with the use of removable drives to spread the malware.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running the malicious code. The question states that this occurs after the worm has spread to both local and remote systems, so this tactic comes after Lateral Movement.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. The question does not mention any data exfiltration activities, so this is not relevant to the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before executing the malicious code is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
