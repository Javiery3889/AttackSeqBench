### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - Scanning a large number of IPs to identify vulnerable systems.
     - Using spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to infect targets.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.002-Email Addresses):** This technique involves collecting email addresses, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning IPs to identify vulnerable systems:** This is a form of reconnaissance to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Using spear phishing emails with crafted documents:** This is a form of initial access to gain entry into the target's system.
   - The question asks what tactic occurred between these two actions. Given the sequence:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Scanning IPs to identify vulnerable systems.
     2. **(Unknown Tactic):** The tactic we need to identify.
     3. **Initial Access:** Using spear phishing emails with crafted documents.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. It does not fit between reconnaissance and initial access.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to support future actions. It fits the initial scanning of IPs but not the step between reconnaissance and initial access.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to identify and capture credentials. It does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining entry into the target's system. It fits the use of spear phishing emails but not the step between reconnaissance and initial access.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Scanning IPs to identify vulnerable systems.
     2. **Initial Access:** Using spear phishing emails with crafted documents.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred between these two actions is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
