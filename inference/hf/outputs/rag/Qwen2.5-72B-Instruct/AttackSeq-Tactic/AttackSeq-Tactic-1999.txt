### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a compromised router is used as a proxy server to configure the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next as the final stage of the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic between the attacker and the victim.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This sub-technique involves using multiple proxies to further obfuscate the attacker's traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand the attacker's access. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not typically the final stage of an attack.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that the C2 infrastructure has been configured, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to additional systems. This is often a step taken early in the attack to gain initial access or to move laterally, but it is not typically the final stage.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system and transferring it to the attacker. This is often the final stage of an attack, as the attacker's goal is to obtain valuable information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible final stage of the attack is **Exfiltration**. After setting up the C2 infrastructure, the attacker would likely focus on stealing and transferring data.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
