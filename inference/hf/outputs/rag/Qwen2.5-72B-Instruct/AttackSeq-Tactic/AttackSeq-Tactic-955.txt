### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker exploits CVE-2017-11882 to achieve silent code execution upon opening a crafted Excel document.
   - After this, the attacker dumps credentials from various registry keys using techniques like T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) and T1214 (Credential Dumping from Registry).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Excel) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, such as from the registry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. While the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 is part of the initial access, the question is asking about what happens after the initial access is established.
   - **Resource Development (B):**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing malware or creating phishing emails. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Credential Access (C):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from the system. The question explicitly mentions that credentials are dumped from the registry using T1003 and T1214, which fall under the Credential Access tactic.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion might be part of the overall attack, the question specifically focuses on the sequence of events leading to credential dumping.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attacker first gains initial access through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882, and then proceeds to dump credentials from the registry. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before credential dumping is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
