### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attacker used custom batch scripts to collate identified files into archives but before exfiltrating the archived data with tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves using built-in utilities to compress and archive files.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated methods to transfer data out of the network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves moving data to a central location within the network before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - The related TTPs T1560.001 (Archive via Utility) and T1074.002 (Remote Data Staging) both fall under the Collection tactic. These techniques are used to gather and prepare data for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the steps taken after data has been identified and before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining and using credentials to gain access to systems. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the steps taken after data has been identified and before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the steps taken after data has been identified and before exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Collection tactic occurred after the data was collated into archives and before the exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Collection**
