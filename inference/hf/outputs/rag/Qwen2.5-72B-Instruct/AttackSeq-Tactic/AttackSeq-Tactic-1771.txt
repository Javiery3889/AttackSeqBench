### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers used captured credentials to connect to the processor's network and execute reconnaissance of the card processing service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials through a web portal.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for future use in reconnaissance activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - C2 is typically used after gaining access to a system to maintain control and communicate with the compromised system. It is not a likely candidate for the step before using captured credentials to connect to the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the first foothold in the target environment. Using valid accounts (T1078) is a common method for initial access. However, the question implies that the credentials were already captured, so this is not the most likely step before using the credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access. This is a plausible step after gaining initial access and capturing credentials, but it is not the most likely step before using the credentials to connect to the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. Collecting credentials (T1589.001) is a common reconnaissance activity. The question implies that the attackers had already captured the credentials, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the attackers performed reconnaissance to capture the credentials before using them to connect to the network and execute further reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
