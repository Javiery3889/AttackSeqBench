### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Nemesis evades detection by executing components before the Windows OS fully loads and storing the malicious components in a custom virtual file system.
   - The key points are:
     - Evading detection
     - Executing components before the OS fully loads
     - Storing components in a custom virtual file system

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
     - This technique involves creating a hidden file system to store malicious components, making them less likely to be detected.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**
     - This technique involves storing malicious components in memory or other non-persistent storage to avoid detection by file-based security solutions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - The techniques T1564.005 (Hidden File System) and T1027.011 (Fileless Storage) are both under the Defense Evasion tactic. These techniques align with the described behavior of storing components in a custom virtual file system and evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. While this is a crucial tactic, the question specifically focuses on evading detection and storing components, which are more aligned with Defense Evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the system, which is not relevant to the described behavior of evading detection and storing components.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, which is not relevant to the described behavior of evading detection and storing components.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to Defense Evasion, as the techniques T1564.005 and T1027.011 directly align with the described behavior.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
