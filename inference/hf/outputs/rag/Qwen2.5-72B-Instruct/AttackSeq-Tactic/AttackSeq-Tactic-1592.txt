### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Industroyer2, a malware that uses the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol, is deployed to disrupt operations at electrical stations and substations.
   - After the deployment of Industroyer2, wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred are involved.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malware execution involving these wipers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data to disrupt operations.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely immediate action after deploying wipers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. The question already states that the malware has been deployed, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or compromise integrity. The use of wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred to destroy data aligns with the Impact tactic, specifically the T1485-Data Destruction technique.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target. This is typically done before or during the initial stages of the attack, not after deploying wipers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of wipers to destroy data, aligns with the Impact tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Impact**
