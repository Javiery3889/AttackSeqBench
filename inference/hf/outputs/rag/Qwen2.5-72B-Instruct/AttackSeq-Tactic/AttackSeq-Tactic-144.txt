### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that FamousSparrow used SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.
   - We need to determine the next ATT&CK tactic in the attack sequence after this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1071.001-Web Protocols" are relevant.
   - "Command and Control" (C2) is the tactic that involves the adversary's ability to communicate with systems they control within a target network to issue commands and exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that involves the adversary's actions to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack sequence, often after data has been collected and exfiltrated.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control is the tactic that involves the communication between the adversary and the compromised system. Since the question already mentions that communication with the C&C server has been established, this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the tactic that involves the adversary's actions to steal data from the target network. This is a logical next step after establishing C2, as the adversary would likely want to exfiltrate data they have collected.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection is the tactic that involves the adversary's actions to gather data from the target network. This is a plausible next step after establishing C2, as the adversary would need to collect data before exfiltrating it.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after establishing C2 would be to collect data from the target network.
   - Therefore, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
