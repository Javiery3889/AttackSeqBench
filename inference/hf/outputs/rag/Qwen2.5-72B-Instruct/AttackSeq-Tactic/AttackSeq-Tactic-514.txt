### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after reconnaissance activities and before the execution of the Rising Sun implant payload via shellcode within Word macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the use of a malicious file, such as a Word document with a macro, to execute code on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute code on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance**: This is the initial phase where the attackers identify English-speaking targets.
   - **Execution**: This is the phase where the attackers use a malicious file (Word document with a macro) to execute code on the victim's system. The related TTPs clearly indicate that the execution of the shellcode within the Word macros is part of the Execution tactic.
   - **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system, which typically happens before the execution of the payload.
   - **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the extraction of data from the victim's system, which typically happens after the payload has been executed and the system has been compromised.
   - **Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which typically happens after the payload has been executed and the system has been compromised.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after reconnaissance and before the execution of the Rising Sun implant payload is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
