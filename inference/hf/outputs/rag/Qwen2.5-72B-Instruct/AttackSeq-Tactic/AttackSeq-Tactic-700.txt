### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has already scanned for files and prepared data containing paths of files to be exfiltrated.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves communication from the infected system to the attacker using standard ports 80 or 443.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control (C2) communication. However, the question specifically mentions standard ports 80 and 443.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. The question already states that the malware has scanned for files and prepared data, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. The question does not mention any need for privilege escalation at this stage.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack. The question is about the current stage of the attack, not the preparation phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question mentions communication from the infected system to the attacker using standard ports 80 or 443, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
