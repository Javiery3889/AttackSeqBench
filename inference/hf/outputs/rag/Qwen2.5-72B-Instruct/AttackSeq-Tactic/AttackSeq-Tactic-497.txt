### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Russian-speaking cybercriminals used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems of targeted organizations.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force:** This indicates that the attackers used brute force techniques to gain access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This suggests that the ultimate goal of the attack was to steal financial information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This indicates that the attackers set up email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is typically the first step in an attack, where the attackers gain initial access to the system. Given that the question states the attackers have already used remote administration tools to gain credentials, this is not the most likely next step.
   - **Discovery (B):** This tactic involves the attackers exploring the network to understand the environment and identify valuable targets. The question mentions that the attackers explored financial systems, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While this could be part of the attack, the question does not specifically mention the execution of code after gaining credentials and exploring the financial systems.
   - **Impact (D):** This tactic involves the final stages of the attack, such as data exfiltration or financial theft. The related TTP T1657-Financial Theft directly supports this tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible next step after gaining credentials and exploring financial systems is to carry out the Impact tactic, specifically financial theft.

**Final Answer: D: Impact**
