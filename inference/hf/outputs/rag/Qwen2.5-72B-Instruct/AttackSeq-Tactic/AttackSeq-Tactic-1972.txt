### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Elfin extracted credentials using DarkComet and before data was exfiltrated using the custom AutoIt FTP tool FastUploader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
   - These TTPs indicate that the exfiltration of data is a key part of the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is mentioned as already occurring (using DarkComet).
   - **B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system over time. While persistence is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not necessarily the next logical step after credential extraction and before data exfiltration.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with and control the compromised system. After extracting credentials, the attacker would likely need to establish or maintain C2 to exfiltrate data.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gain initial entry into a system. Since the question implies that the attacker has already gained access and extracted credentials, this is not a plausible next step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after extracting credentials, the attacker would need to establish or maintain command and control (C2) to exfiltrate data using the custom FTP tool FastUploader. This is because exfiltration typically requires the attacker to have control over the compromised system to send data out.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
