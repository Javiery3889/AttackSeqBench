### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where `sysOptimizer.bat` collected and archived personal files, including keylogging and clipboard content.
   - After this collection, the components uploaded the collected data and credentials, including Chrome passwords, to an FTP server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of collected data to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial step of `sysOptimizer.bat` collecting personal files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the local system, which has already been described in the question as the initial step.
     - Therefore, this is not the tactic that occurred after the collection but before the exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access and control.
     - The question does not mention any lateral movement activities, so this is not a plausible choice.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves transferring collected data to an external location, which is the final step described in the question.
     - Therefore, this is not the tactic that occurred between the collection and the exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the compromised system.
     - It is plausible that the attacker might have used command and control to manage the exfiltration process, but the question does not provide specific evidence of this step between the collection and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the collection and before the exfiltration is **Command and Control**. This is because the attacker likely needed to maintain control over the compromised system to manage the exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
