### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after a malicious batch file executed a PowerShell script from the Internet to download and extract the main malware library DLL and other components.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell**: This technique involves using Unix shell commands for execution.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script to download and extract components.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While it could be a subsequent step, the question specifically asks about what happens immediately after the execution of the PowerShell script.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the system. Again, this is not directly related to the immediate action of downloading and extracting components.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. The question describes the execution of a PowerShell script to download and extract components, which is a form of execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that the **Execution** tactic occurred after the malicious batch file executed the PowerShell script to download and extract the main malware library DLL and other components.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
