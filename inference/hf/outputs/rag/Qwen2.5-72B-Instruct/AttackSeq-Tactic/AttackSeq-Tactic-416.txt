### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - **Credential Dumping:** Using Mimikatz to extract credentials.
     - **Reconnaissance:** Executing commands to discover remote systems, user accounts, and network topology.
     - **Leveraging Credentials:** Using the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems via webshells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync:** This technique involves using the DCSync method to replicate password hashes from a domain controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the initial step of using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Reconnaissance (B):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target, which aligns with the reconnaissance commands executed to discover remote systems, user accounts, and network topology.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target, which is similar to Reconnaissance but more focused on the internal network and system details.
   - **Lateral Movement (A):** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access, which aligns with the final step of using the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems via webshells.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - **Credential Access:** Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - **Reconnaissance/Discovery:** Executing commands to discover remote systems, user accounts, and network topology.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Using the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems via webshells.

Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Lateral Movement**.
