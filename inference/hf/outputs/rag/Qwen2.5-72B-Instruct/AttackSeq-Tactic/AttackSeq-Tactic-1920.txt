### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers used malware within mobile applications to collect sensitive data such as contact lists, phone call records, and SMS messages from victims' devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the collection of sensitive data from victims' devices.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, which also aligns with the collection of sensitive data from victims' devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system. While this is a necessary step before data collection, it is not the most immediate precursor to the collection of sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. This is not directly related to the collection of data from a single device.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system, which directly aligns with the collection of sensitive data such as contact lists, phone call records, and SMS messages.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the availability of systems and data. This is not related to the collection of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first gained initial access to the victim's device, and then used the malware to collect sensitive data. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred immediately before the collection of data. Given the context, the most immediate precursor to the collection of data is the **Collection** tactic itself, as it directly involves the techniques used to gather the sensitive data.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
