### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a PowerShell script is executed to run at memory level and download the main malware components.
   - After this, the malware uses base64 encoded strings to create shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulate scheduled tasks to maintain its activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code when the user interacts with them.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the malware employed base64 encoded strings to create shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulate scheduled tasks.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using techniques to ensure it persists on the system (T1053.005-Scheduled Task and T1547.009-Shortcut Modification).
   - The initial action of executing a PowerShell script to run at memory level and download the main malware components falls under the **Execution** tactic.
   - The subsequent actions of creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks are part of the **Persistence** tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the **Execution** tactic occurred first, followed by the **Persistence** tactic.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that occurred before the persistence actions.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
