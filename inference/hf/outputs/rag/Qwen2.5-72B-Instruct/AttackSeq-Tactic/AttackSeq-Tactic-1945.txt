### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers used a compromised ESTsoft server to distribute a trojaned update file containing 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' to SK Communications computers during routine software update checks.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial distribution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves making malicious files or directories appear legitimate by using names or locations that are similar to legitimate ones.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file, often through user interaction.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to distribute malicious software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain)**: This technique is used to gain initial access to the target system by compromising the software supply chain. In this case, the attackers compromised the ESTsoft server to distribute the trojaned update file. This is the initial step in the attack.
   - **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File)**: After the trojaned update file is distributed, the next logical step is for the file to be executed on the target system. This is the most likely tactic to occur after the initial access.
   - **Discovery (T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location)**: This technique is more about evading detection by making the malicious file appear legitimate. While it is part of the attack, it is not the next immediate step after the file is distributed.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task)**: This technique involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically follows the execution of the initial payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described, the most likely tactic to occur after the attackers used the compromised ESTsoft server to distribute the trojaned update file is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
