### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the adversaries evaded security measures using specific techniques (ZwWriteVirtualMemory and ZwCreateSection) and before they established command and control (C2) using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the adversaries used the Command and Control tactic with the technique T1071.001 (Web Protocols) to transmit data over HTTP and HTTPS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While it is a common step in an attack, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after evading security measures and before establishing C2.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversaries gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is a logical step to take after evading security measures to understand the environment better before establishing C2.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This is the tactic that the adversaries are using to transmit data over HTTP and HTTPS, which is explicitly mentioned in the question as occurring after the evasion techniques.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While it is a crucial step, it typically occurs earlier in the attack sequence, often before evasion and discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after evading security measures and before establishing command and control is **Discovery**. The adversaries would likely need to gather information about the environment to effectively establish C2.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
