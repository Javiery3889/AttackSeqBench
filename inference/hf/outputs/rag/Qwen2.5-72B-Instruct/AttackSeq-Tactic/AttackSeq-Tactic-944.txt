### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before PowerShell scripts were executed to decode and run embedded backdoor components.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the network, which is already described as happening through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.
   - **Reconnaissance (B):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It typically occurs before initial access, not after.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving through the network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access and execution.
   - **Execution (A):** This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. Given that the question mentions the execution of PowerShell scripts to decode and run embedded backdoor components, this is the most relevant tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access, the next step was the execution of PowerShell scripts to decode and run the backdoor components.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
