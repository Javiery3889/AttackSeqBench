### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this encryption and blending.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network and identify valuable targets. While this could occur after establishing command and control, it is not directly related to the encryption and blending of network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining control over the compromised system. The related TTPs (T1001.003, T1571, T1573.001) all fall under the Command and Control tactic and describe techniques for maintaining and securing command and control communications.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to avoid detection. While encryption and blending with normal traffic can be a form of defense evasion, the primary focus of the related TTPs is on maintaining command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining long-term access to the system. While persistence is important, the described techniques are more focused on maintaining command and control communications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**. The related TTPs (T1001.003, T1571, T1573.001) all fall under the Command and Control tactic and describe techniques for maintaining and securing command and control communications.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
