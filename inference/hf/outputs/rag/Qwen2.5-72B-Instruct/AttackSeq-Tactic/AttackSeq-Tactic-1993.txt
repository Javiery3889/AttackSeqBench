### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence is: Achieved persistence → (Unknown Tactic) → Harvested credentials using the Responder tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to extract credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves manipulating network protocols to capture and relay authentication requests.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Achieved Persistence:**
     - The technique T1053.002-At is used to schedule tasks for persistence, which aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Harvested Credentials using the Responder tool:**
     - The Responder tool is known for LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay, which aligns with the technique T1557.001.
   - **Unknown Tactic:**
     - The question asks for the tactic that occurred between achieving persistence and harvesting credentials.
     - The related TTPs suggest that the unknown tactic is related to credential access, as both T1040 and T1557.001 fall under the Credential Access tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is: Achieved persistence (T1053.002-At) → Credential Access (T1040 or T1557.001) → Harvested credentials using the Responder tool (T1557.001).

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
