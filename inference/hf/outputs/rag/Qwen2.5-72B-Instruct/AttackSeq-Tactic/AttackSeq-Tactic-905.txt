### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after WinDealer maintained persistence through the registry's RUN key and before the malware initiated communication with machines selected using a complex IP generation algorithm.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the registry to evade detection or to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves setting up registry run keys to ensure the malware runs at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes T1547.001 and other methods to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:** This is already part of the sequence described (WinDealer maintained persistence through the registry's RUN key). Therefore, it cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions. While it could be part of the attack, the question does not provide evidence that this occurred between maintaining persistence and initiating communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. It is plausible that the malware would need to discover the network environment before initiating communication with specific machines.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the malware. It is unlikely that the malware would cause impact before initiating communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after maintaining persistence and before initiating communication is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
