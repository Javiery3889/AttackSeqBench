### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a watering hole operation was used to trick users into downloading malware through a fake Adobe Flash update.
   - The malware, PyFlash, then began executing system commands to retrieve system information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before PyFlash began executing these system commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the watering hole operation and the fake Adobe Flash update.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content, which also aligns with the watering hole operation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which would typically occur after the malware has already gained access and executed initial commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is what happens when the user downloads and opens the fake Adobe Flash update.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the malware gathering information about the system, which aligns with the system commands to retrieve system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system, which would typically occur after the initial execution and discovery phases.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** The watering hole operation compromises a website to deliver the malicious content.
     2. **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File):** The user is tricked into downloading and opening the fake Adobe Flash update, which executes the malware.
     3. **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery):** The malware, PyFlash, begins executing system commands to retrieve system information.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before PyFlash began executing system commands to retrieve system information is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
