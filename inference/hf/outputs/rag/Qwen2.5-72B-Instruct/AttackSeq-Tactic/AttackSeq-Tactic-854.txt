### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after enabling macros (which executed payloads) and before the backdoor function gathered machine information and sent it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the enabling of macros that executed payloads.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves gaining initial access through a spearphishing link, which is likely the initial step in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it could be relevant, it is not the most immediate step after enabling macros and before gathering machine information.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system. While it is a crucial part of many attack sequences, it is not typically the immediate next step after enabling macros and before gathering machine information.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and executing the payload, as the attacker needs to understand the environment before gathering specific information.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. While it is relevant to the initial execution of the payload, the question asks about the step after enabling macros and before gathering machine information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker would perform **Discovery** after enabling macros and before gathering machine information and sending it to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
