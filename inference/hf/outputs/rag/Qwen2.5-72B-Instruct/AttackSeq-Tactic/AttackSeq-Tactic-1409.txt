### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a trojanized version of 3CX software was distributed in a supply chain attack, leading to the infiltration of Smooth Operator malware on macOS systems.
   - The key points are:
     - **Supply Chain Attack**: The 3CX software was compromised.
     - **Trojanized Software**: The compromised software contained malware (Smooth Operator).
     - **Infiltration**: The malware successfully infiltrated macOS systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party software supply chain to gain initial access to a target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This sub-technique specifically refers to the compromise of software supply chains to distribute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they have compromised. While this is a common next step after gaining initial access, it is not the most immediate action following the distribution of trojanized software.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain further access. This is also a common next step but not the immediate action after the initial compromise.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**: This tactic involves running the malware on the target system. While this is a critical step, it is part of the initial access process and not a separate tactic that follows initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target environment. The distribution of trojanized software and the subsequent infiltration of the malware are both part of the initial access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is that the initial access was achieved through the supply chain compromise and the distribution of the trojanized software.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
