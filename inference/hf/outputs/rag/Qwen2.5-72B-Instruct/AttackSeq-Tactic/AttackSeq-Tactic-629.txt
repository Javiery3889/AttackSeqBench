### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before TG-3279 used a port scanning tool named 's' and an RDP brute force tool 'rdp_crk' to scan and exploit targets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries scanning the network to identify active systems, open ports, and services.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the actual attack. This could include identifying potential targets, network topology, and vulnerabilities.
     - Given that the question mentions the use of a port scanning tool, which is a common reconnaissance activity, this choice is highly plausible.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves adversaries trying to map the network and identify active systems and services. This is a step that typically follows initial access and is more about understanding the internal network.
     - While port scanning can be part of discovery, the question specifically mentions the use of a port scanning tool, which is more aligned with the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. This is not directly related to the use of a port scanning tool or RDP brute force tool.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is not directly related to the initial scanning and exploitation activities mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the reconnaissance phase occurred before the use of the port scanning tool and RDP brute force tool. The port scanning tool is a common tool used during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about the target network.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
