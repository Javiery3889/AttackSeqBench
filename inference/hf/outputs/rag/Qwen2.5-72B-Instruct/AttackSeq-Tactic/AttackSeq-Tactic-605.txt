### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after FIN4 transmitted stolen credentials along with campaign codes to its infrastructure using servers such as junomaat81[.]us and lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user and service accounts to maintain access and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user and service accounts to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for use in future attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration (T1010) involves the process of stealing and sending data out of a network. Given that the question mentions "transmitted stolen credentials," this aligns well with the exfiltration tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) (T1071) involves establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system. While C2 is crucial for maintaining access, the question specifically mentions the transmission of stolen credentials, which is more aligned with exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access (T1003) involves techniques to obtain credentials from a system. The question already states that credentials have been stolen, so this tactic would have occurred before the transmission.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance (T1589.001) involves gathering information to plan future attacks. While collecting credentials is part of reconnaissance, the question is about the action taken after the credentials have been stolen and transmitted.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the stolen credentials were exfiltrated to the attacker's infrastructure. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Exfiltration**
