### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Aria-body backdoor gathers system information, and the Naikon APT group uses it to collect files, screenshots, and metadata.
   - The next step in the sequence is to facilitate communication with the C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the gathering of system information and files.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending stolen data over a C2 (Command and Control) channel, which is the next logical step after collecting data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is part of the data collection process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** While collection is a crucial part of the attack, it is already covered by the related TTPs (T1005 and T1113). The question asks about the next step, which is communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network, which is also part of the initial stages but not the next step after data collection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with the C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data, which is the next logical step after data collection and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves communication with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
