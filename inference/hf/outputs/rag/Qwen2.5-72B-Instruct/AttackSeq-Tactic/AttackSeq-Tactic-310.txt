### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of VBA macros in malicious documents, which delivered first-stage payloads.
   - The sequence of events mentioned includes:
     - Execution of VBA macros in malicious documents.
     - Delivery of first-stage payloads.
     - Ensuring persistence through Windows registry entries.
     - Performing reconnaissance on victim computers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBA) to execute code, which is consistent with the execution of VBA macros in malicious documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the victim's environment. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs after the initial access and execution of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This is a later stage in the attack, typically after reconnaissance and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the victim's system. The execution of VBA macros in malicious documents is a method of initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending data out of the victim's network. This is a later stage in the attack, typically after collection and possibly after establishing persistence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The execution of VBA macros in malicious documents is a method of gaining initial access to the victim's system. After gaining initial access, the next logical step in the attack sequence is to ensure persistence and perform reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is the tactic that describes the initial entry point, which is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
