### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking through the benign file `sidebar.exe` to evade antivirus detection.
   - The key points are:
     - Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking.
     - The benign file used was `sidebar.exe`.
     - The purpose was to evade antivirus detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - Both TTPs mention DLL Side-Loading, which is the technique used by Tropic Trooper.
   - The first TTP is under the Persistence tactic, and the second TTP is under the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This is not directly related to the evasion of antivirus detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim's system. This is also not directly related to the evasion of antivirus detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection by security products. DLL hijacking is a common technique used for this purpose.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. This is not directly related to the evasion of antivirus detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **Defense Evasion**. DLL hijacking is a technique used to evade detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
