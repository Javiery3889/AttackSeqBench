### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by UNC1151, starting with gaining initial access through spear phishing campaigns using malicious attachments.
   - The next step in the sequence involves stealing victim credentials via spoofed websites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This is a specific type of phishing where malicious attachments are used to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the victim's network. While this could be a later step in the attack, it does not align with the immediate action of stealing credentials via spoofed websites.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials from victims. Stealing credentials via spoofed websites is a common method under this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the victim's network and systems. While discovery might occur after gaining initial access, it does not directly align with the act of stealing credentials via spoofed websites.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain initial access to a victim's system. While spear phishing is an initial access technique, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is stealing credentials via spoofed websites.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through spear phishing, UNC1151 would use the **Credential Access** tactic to steal victim credentials via spoofed websites.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
