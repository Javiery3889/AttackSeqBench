### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Turla used a PowerShell script to install the LightNeuron backdoor on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This indicates that the use of PowerShell for execution is a key part of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.002-Transport Agent:** This suggests that the LightNeuron backdoor is used for persistence by modifying the transport agent on the Exchange server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the network. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the execution of scripts and the installation of backdoors.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems. This is often done after gaining initial access but before executing scripts and installing backdoors.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network. This is typically done after gaining initial access and possibly after some discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code, such as a PowerShell script, to perform actions like installing a backdoor. This is the most immediate step before the installation of the LightNeuron backdoor.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the use of a PowerShell script to install the LightNeuron backdoor, the most logical sequence is that the execution of the PowerShell script (T1059.001) is the immediate step before the installation of the backdoor.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of the PowerShell script is the **Execution** tactic itself.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
