### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker first gathers system information using various methods (WMI, CPUID, and win32 API calls) and then uses the 'dstr.dll' plugin to overwrite data on hard drives, which can disrupt availability or compromise integrity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial action of gathering system information falls under the **Discovery** tactic, specifically the technique **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system, which is also not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **Impact (C):** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or compromise integrity, which aligns with the use of the 'dstr.dll' plugin to overwrite data on hard drives.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information from a system, which is relevant to the initial action of gathering system information but not to the subsequent action of overwriting data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial discovery of system information, the attacker then moved to the **Impact** tactic by using the 'dstr.dll' plugin to overwrite data on hard drives.

**Final Answer: C: Impact**
