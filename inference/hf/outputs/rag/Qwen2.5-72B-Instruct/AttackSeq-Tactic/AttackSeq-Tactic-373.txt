### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome was exploited to gain arbitrary read/write access.
   - After gaining this access, tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This could be a plausible choice because the use of the Windows Task Scheduler to execute malicious code is a form of execution. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial exploitation and before the persistence was set up.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**: This is the most direct match because the question mentions that tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence. The T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique is explicitly listed under the Persistence tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**: This tactic is not mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that the Persistence tactic occurred after the initial exploitation and before the tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
