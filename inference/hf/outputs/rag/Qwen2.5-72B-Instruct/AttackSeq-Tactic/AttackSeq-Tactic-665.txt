### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the KerrDown DLL is dropped in a directory and the payload is executed directly in memory for Defense Evasion.
   - The next step in the sequence is the KerrDown downloader attempting to download the final payload from a URL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is not directly related to downloading a payload from a URL.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial steps (dropping the DLL and executing the payload in memory). The question is asking about the next step, which is downloading the final payload.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. Downloading a payload from a URL is a common method of establishing command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. Downloading a payload from a URL is not a discovery technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial Defense Evasion and Execution, the next step is Command and Control, where the KerrDown downloader attempts to download the final payload from a URL.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
