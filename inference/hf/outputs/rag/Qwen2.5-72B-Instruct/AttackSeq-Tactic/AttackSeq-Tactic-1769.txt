### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers initially gain access through phishing emails and create backdoors.
   - After gaining initial access, they prepare for lateral movement using legitimate Windows and PowerShell commands and tools like PSExec.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell for execution of commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is a common step in an attack, it is not necessarily the most immediate step after gaining initial access and before lateral movement.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which are often necessary for lateral movement. After gaining initial access, attackers often need to gather additional credentials to move laterally.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access and before lateral movement.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target. While collection can occur at various stages, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access and before lateral movement.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step between gaining initial access and preparing for lateral movement is to obtain the necessary credentials. This is because lateral movement often requires valid credentials to access other systems within the network.

### Final Answer: B: Credential Access
