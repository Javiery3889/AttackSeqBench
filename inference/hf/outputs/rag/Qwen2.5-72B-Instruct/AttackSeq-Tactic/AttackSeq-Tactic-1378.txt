### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred before FIN13 used web services and JSP tools to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions, after using proxies and encoding data for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the attackers used web protocols for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This indicates that the attackers stole financial data for fraudulent transactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the use of web services and JSP tools for data theft.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The related TTPs mention the use of web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of proxies and encoding data for command and control.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the compromised system. The question mentions that data was stolen for fraudulent transactions, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the use of web services and JSP tools for data theft.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question states that the attackers used web services and JSP tools to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions after using proxies and encoding data for command and control. This implies that the command and control phase was already established before the data theft occurred.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the data theft (Exfiltration).

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
