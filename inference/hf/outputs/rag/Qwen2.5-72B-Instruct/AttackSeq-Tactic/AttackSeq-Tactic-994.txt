### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a spear-phishing attack exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-5119) to deliver a secondary payload.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Adobe Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spear-phishing email with an attachment that, when opened, delivers the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not directly related to the execution of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It is not relevant to the initial stages of the attack described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The related TTPs (T1203 and T1204.002) both fall under the Execution tactic, indicating that the exploitation and execution of the payload are part of this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target system. The related TTP (T1566.001) indicates that the spear-phishing attack is part of the Initial Access tactic.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The spear-phishing attack (T1566.001) is the initial step that gains access to the system.
   - After gaining access, the exploitation of the Adobe Flash vulnerability (T1203) and the execution of the ActionScript classes (T1204.002) occur to install the payload.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Initial Access (T1566.001) occurred before the Execution (T1203 and T1204.002).

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
