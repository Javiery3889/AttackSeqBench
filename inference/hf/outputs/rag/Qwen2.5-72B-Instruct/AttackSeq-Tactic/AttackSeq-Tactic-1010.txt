### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where initial reconnaissance has been conducted, and information such as system details, browser history, and cached credentials has been collected.
   - The next step in the sequence is lateral movement using MS08-067 exploits and admin credentials to infect other network hosts.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the collection of system details, browser history, and cached credentials. However, this is more of a preparatory step for the next phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system over time. This is typically done after gaining initial access and is not a direct step between reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target. The question already states that initial reconnaissance has been conducted, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system. This is a logical step after collecting credentials and before using them to move laterally.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after initial reconnaissance and before lateral movement is **Privilege Escalation**. This is because the attacker would need to escalate their privileges to use the collected credentials effectively for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation**
