### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the `versioninfo.bat` script discovered system details and before the `unactivate.vbs` script exfiltrated data using a POST request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a compromised system.
   - **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.
   - **Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where data is exfiltrated using the `unactivate.vbs` script. It does not fit the requirement of occurring after discovery and before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This is the initial step where `versioninfo.bat` discovers system details. It does not fit the requirement of occurring after discovery and before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It is a plausible step that could occur between discovery and exfiltration, as the attacker might need to maintain control to execute the exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The related TTP (T1070.004-File Deletion) suggests that the attacker might delete files to cover their tracks, which is a plausible step that could occur between discovery and exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Both **Command and Control** and **Defense Evasion** are plausible steps that could occur between discovery and exfiltration. However, **Defense Evasion** (specifically file deletion) is more directly related to the context of the question, as it involves actions to avoid detection, which is a common step before exfiltration to ensure the attack remains undetected.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
