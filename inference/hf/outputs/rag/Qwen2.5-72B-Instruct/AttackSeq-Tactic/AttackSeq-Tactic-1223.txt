### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by attackers using the PoisonIvy Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Dumping Windows cached password hashes for credential access.
     - Preparing collected intellectual property for exfiltration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials**
     - This technique involves extracting cached domain credentials from the Windows operating system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include intellectual property.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the context of maintaining communication with a server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - The Exfiltration tactic involves techniques for transferring data out of a network. While this is part of the attack sequence, it does not describe maintaining communication with a server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves techniques for communicating with and controlling compromised systems. This fits the context of maintaining communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - The Persistence tactic involves techniques for maintaining access to systems over time. While this is important for long-term control, it does not specifically describe maintaining communication with a server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **C: Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
