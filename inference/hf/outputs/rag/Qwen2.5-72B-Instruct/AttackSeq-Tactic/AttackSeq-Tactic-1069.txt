### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers gained initial access to a victim's system by exploiting CVE-2018-8174 via a watering hole attack.
   - After gaining access, the attackers used a downloader to leverage CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Privilege Escalation" and the technique "T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation."
   - This indicates that the final step in the sequence is the exploitation for privilege escalation, which aligns with the use of CVE-2015-1701.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after initial access and before or during privilege escalation.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the victim's system. The question already states that initial access was gained via the watering hole attack.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before privilege escalation.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It typically occurs before initial access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of events is: Initial Access (via CVE-2018-8174) → Execution (running the downloader) → Privilege Escalation (using CVE-2015-1701).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after gaining initial access and before privilege escalation is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
