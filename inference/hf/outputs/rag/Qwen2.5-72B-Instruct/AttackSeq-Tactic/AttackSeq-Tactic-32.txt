### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections and specific URIs for commands.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur when stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) is sent to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves the malware using legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the malware sending stolen data back to the C2 server using the same communication channel it uses for receiving commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the scenario of sending stolen data to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - The Execution tactic involves running malicious code. This is not relevant to the scenario of sending stolen data to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While the malware communicates with the C2 server, this tactic is more about receiving commands rather than sending data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - The Exfiltration tactic involves stealing and sending data from the compromised system to the attacker. The technique T1041 specifically describes exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which matches the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the stolen data is sent to the C2 infrastructure as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
