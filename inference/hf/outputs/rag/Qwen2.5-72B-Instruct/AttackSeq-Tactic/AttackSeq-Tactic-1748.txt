### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have used process hollowing to evade defenses and have obfuscated the second-stage payload as an image file.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique is used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique can also be used to escalate privileges by injecting code into a higher-privileged process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. While process hollowing can be used to maintain persistence, it is not the most immediate next step after evading defenses.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After evading defenses and successfully injecting the payload, the next logical step is to establish a C2 channel to control the compromised system.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up servers or domains. This is typically done before the attack, not after evading defenses.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. While discovery can occur after evading defenses, it is not the most immediate or critical next step compared to establishing C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers would establish a Command and Control (C2) channel after evading defenses and injecting the payload.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
