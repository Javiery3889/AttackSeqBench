### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attacker used malicious Microsoft Word documents to deliver encrypted script data and initiate the Bandook payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This technique is used to gain the initial foothold in the target system. The malicious Microsoft Word document is likely the attachment in the spearphishing email.
   - **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File):** This technique occurs when the user opens the malicious file, which then executes the payload (in this case, the Bandook payload).

   Given the sequence described in the question:
   - The attacker sends a spearphishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word document (Initial Access).
   - The user opens the document, which then delivers the encrypted script data and initiates the Bandook payload (Execution).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the **Execution** tactic occurred after the Initial Access tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
