### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through the injection of malicious code into a dynamic library of 3CX software.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker ensured continued functionality by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a running process to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a running process to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. This is a likely step after gaining initial access, but it doesn't necessarily ensure continued functionality.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system. While this is a common step in an attack, it doesn't directly ensure continued functionality.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. This aligns well with the step of ensuring continued functionality by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack. This is typically done before initial access and is not relevant to ensuring continued functionality.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker gained initial access, then ensured persistence by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
