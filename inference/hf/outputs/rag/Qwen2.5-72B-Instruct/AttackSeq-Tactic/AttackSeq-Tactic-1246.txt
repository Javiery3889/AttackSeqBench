### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Mustang Panda used spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts and before leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which in this case is the '.lnk' file containing HTA scripts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves gaining initial access to a system through spearphishing links.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link):** This is the first step where the attacker gains initial access to the victim's system by sending a spearphishing link.
   - **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File):** After the victim clicks the spearphishing link, the malicious '.lnk' file containing HTA scripts is executed.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is mentioned in the question as the next step after the execution of the malicious file.
   - **Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the victim's system, which is not mentioned as occurring between the execution of the malicious file and the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the victim's system, which is also not mentioned as occurring between the execution of the malicious file and the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the execution of the malicious file (T1204.002-Malicious File), the next step is to evade detection (Defense Evasion) before leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
