### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the 'Surtr' malware:
     - Listed file directories.
     - Executed remote commands.
     - Logged keystrokes.
     - Connected to internet.3-a.net on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves logging keystrokes to collect sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages to establish and maintain command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves listing file directories to understand the victim's environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery):**
     - This tactic is relevant to the initial action of listing file directories.
   - **Collection (T1056.001-Keylogging):**
     - This tactic is relevant to the action of logging keystrokes.
   - **Command and Control (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels):**
     - This tactic is relevant to the action of connecting to a remote server (internet.3-a.net) and downloading a stage two component. This indicates that the malware is establishing and maintaining C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the actions described, is that the malware connected to the internet and downloaded a stage two component, which is a clear indication of Command and Control (C2) activity.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
