### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN8 ensured persistence using the WMI event subscription mechanism and before executing credential dumping via a script named `mimi.ps1`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - This technique is used to ensure that the attacker's code runs automatically when certain events occur, maintaining a foothold in the system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - This technique can also be used to escalate privileges by running code with higher privileges when certain events occur.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system. Since the question states that persistence has already been established, this tactic is unlikely to occur after persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not specifically tied to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Credential Access (C):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question mentions executing credential dumping via `mimi.ps1`, which is a common method for credential access. Therefore, this tactic is a strong candidate for the step that occurs after persistence and before credential dumping.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, it is typically done before gaining initial access or establishing persistence, not after.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after ensuring persistence and before executing credential dumping is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
