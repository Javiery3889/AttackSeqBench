### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the XAgent Password module saved retrieved Firefox browser passwords for exfiltration to the C&C servers.
   - The key action here is the retrieval of browser passwords, which is a form of credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Credential Access** and the technique is **T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**.
   - This technique specifically involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the action of retrieving Firefox browser passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which is not directly related to retrieving browser passwords.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves sending data out of the network, which would occur after the passwords are retrieved, not before.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which directly aligns with the action of retrieving browser passwords.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not the primary focus of retrieving browser passwords.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the exfiltration of Firefox browser passwords is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
