### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker first uses techniques for credential access by targeting FTP clients, VPN clients, and RDP configurations.
   - After gaining credentials, the Sayad malware collects information such as keystrokes and screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the attacker targets FTP clients, VPN clients, and RDP configurations.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is part of the information collection described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This is the initial tactic described in the question where the attacker gains credentials. However, the question asks what tactic occurred before the information collection, which is already part of the Credential Access phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves sending data out of the network, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network, which is a logical step before collecting specific information like keystrokes and screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial entry into the network, which is not described in the question. The question starts with the attacker already having access to credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gains credentials (Credential Access), then discovers the environment (Discovery), and finally collects information like keystrokes and screenshots.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
