### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the FHAPPI campaign used VBScript to create an object in the shell and executed PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code to infect the victim's system.
   - The key actions are:
     - Using VBScript to create an object in the shell.
     - Executing PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:**
     - The use of VBScript to create an object in the shell and the execution of PowerShell commands are both part of the Execution tactic.
     - The PowerShell commands are being executed, which aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves techniques used to gain entry into a system, such as phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities.
     - The described actions (using VBScript and PowerShell) are more about executing commands rather than gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves techniques used to obtain credentials from a system.
     - The described actions do not involve credential harvesting or access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques used to avoid detection.
     - The use of base64 encoded PowerShell commands is a form of command obfuscation, which aligns with the T1027.010-Command Obfuscation technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is that the Execution tactic occurred first, followed by Defense Evasion.
   - However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** the described actions.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the one that aligns with the next step in the attack sequence, which is Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
