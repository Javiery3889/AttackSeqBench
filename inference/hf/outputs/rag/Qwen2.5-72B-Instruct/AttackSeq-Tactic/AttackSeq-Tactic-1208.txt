### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker gains Initial Access through a compromised legitimate website and delivers a malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
   - The question specifically asks about the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Initial Access, involving the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves an attacker compromising a website and using it to deliver malicious content to visitors.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves an attacker compromising the software supply chain to deliver malicious content, such as a malicious update.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While reconnaissance is often a preliminary step, it does not directly involve the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update.
   - **Discovery (B):** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information from the target system after gaining access. It is not relevant to the initial steps of the attack described.
   - **Impact (C):** This tactic involves the attacker causing damage or disruption to the target. It is not relevant to the initial steps of the attack described.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to the target system. The techniques T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) and T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain) are directly related to the initial access phase, where the attacker uses a compromised website and a malicious JavaScript update to gain access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the attacker using a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update, which is part of the Initial Access tactic. The techniques T1189 and T1195.002 are directly related to this phase.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
