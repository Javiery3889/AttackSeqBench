### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker used tools like JuicyPotato for privilege escalation and created local admin users for persistence.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the discovery activities using tools like 'STSRCheck'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This indicates that the attacker used local accounts to escalate privileges.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This indicates that the attacker used tools to discover network services.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account:** This indicates that the attacker created local accounts to ensure persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While this is a common initial step, the question already mentions privilege escalation and persistence, which typically follow credential access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. The question mentions using 'STSRCheck' for discovery activities, so this is a part of the sequence but not before privilege escalation and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions. The question explicitly mentions using JuicyPotato for privilege escalation, so this is a part of the sequence but not before the tactic we are looking for.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information before the attack. This is typically the first step in an attack sequence, occurring before privilege escalation and persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the discovery activities is **Reconnaissance**. This is because reconnaissance is the initial step where the attacker gathers information about the target before attempting to escalate privileges or ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
