### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Armageddon Group used Remote Template Injection techniques (T1221) with RTF and DOCX files and before they used Telegram channels for communication with compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into templates to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in a system. The related TTP (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) suggests that the group used spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. However, the question states that the group already used Remote Template Injection, which is a technique for defense evasion, not initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. The use of Telegram channels for communication with compromised systems is a clear indication of command and control activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. It is less likely to occur between the use of Remote Template Injection and the establishment of command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The related TTP (T1221-Template Injection) is already mentioned in the question, indicating that defense evasion has already occurred.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. The group used Remote Template Injection (T1221) to evade detection.
     2. They then needed to establish command and control to communicate with the compromised systems using Telegram channels.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the use of Remote Template Injection and the use of Telegram channels is **Command and Control**.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
