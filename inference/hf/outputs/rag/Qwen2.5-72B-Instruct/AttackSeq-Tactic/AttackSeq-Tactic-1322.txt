### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Earth Wendigo.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing malicious scripts using XSS vulnerabilities and Service Worker registration.
     - Ensuring stealth by hiding code in CSS elements.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:**
     - This technique involves executing JavaScript code to perform malicious actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. This could be relevant if the threat actor is trying to ensure they can return to the system later, but it doesn't fit well between executing scripts and hiding code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Hiding code in CSS elements is a form of defense evasion, so this tactic fits well with the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and doesn't fit well between executing scripts and hiding code.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. This is also typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and doesn't fit well between executing scripts and hiding code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between executing malicious scripts and ensuring stealth by hiding code in CSS elements is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
