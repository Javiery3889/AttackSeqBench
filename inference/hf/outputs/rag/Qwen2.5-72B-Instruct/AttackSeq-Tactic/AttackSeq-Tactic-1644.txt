### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideCopy APT group.
   - The sequence includes developing phishing portals and deploying RATs and post-infection plugins.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves registering or acquiring domains to support future operations.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique also involves registering or acquiring domains to support future operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This is typically a post-infection activity and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a victim's system. This is a step that would occur after gaining initial access but before deploying RATs and post-infection plugins.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. This is typically a post-infection activity and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry into a victim's system. This fits the sequence described, as the group would need to gain initial access after developing phishing portals and before deploying RATs and post-infection plugins.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the SideCopy APT group would gain Initial Access after developing phishing portals and before deploying RATs and post-infection plugins.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
