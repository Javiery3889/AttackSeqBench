### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently and uses DNS to communicate.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this deployment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the technique is "T1071.004-DNS."
   - This suggests that the backdoor is using DNS for command and control purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - While the backdoor installs persistently, this is part of the initial deployment and not what happens after the deployment.
   - **B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing for an attack, such as gathering resources, and is typically a pre-attack phase.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which could happen after the backdoor is deployed, but it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's network, which is a common goal after establishing command and control.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most immediate and logical next step after deploying a backdoor that uses DNS for command and control is to use that command and control channel to perform further actions, such as exfiltrating data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after the RoyalDNS backdoor is deployed and command and control is established, the attackers would likely move to exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
