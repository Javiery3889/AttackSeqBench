### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker exploits a public-facing application, uploads webshells, and then deploys custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the deployment of the custom malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This indicates that the initial access was gained by exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This indicates that PowerShell was used for execution, which is a common method for running commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution (T1059) is a tactic that involves running malicious code. Given that the attacker deployed custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution, this tactic is relevant but it occurs after gaining initial access and uploading webshells.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development (T1583) involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This typically happens before the initial access and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access (T1190) is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains a foothold by exploiting a public-facing application. This is the initial step before uploading webshells and deploying custom malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (T1071) involves establishing and maintaining communication with the compromised system. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and executing commands, but it is not the immediate next step after uploading webshells.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred before deploying custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' is **Initial Access**. The attacker first gains access by exploiting a public-facing application, then uploads webshells, and finally deploys the custom malware.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
