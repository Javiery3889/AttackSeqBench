### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before OceanLotus gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros.
   - The context is Operation Cobalt Kitty, which is a known cyber espionage campaign.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious sites.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with weaponized Word documents containing malicious macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to support planning future actions. It is a common first step in many cyber attacks, as attackers need to understand their targets before launching an attack.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This tactic involves establishing resources to support operations. This could include setting up infrastructure, but it is less likely to be the immediate step before initial access.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target. It typically occurs after gaining access to the target's systems.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target's systems to aid in further actions. It also typically occurs after gaining access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question is asking about the step that occurred before gaining initial access, the most logical choice is **Reconnaissance**. Attackers need to gather information about their targets to craft effective spear-phishing emails. This includes identifying key personnel, understanding their roles, and finding out what types of documents or links they are likely to open.
   - **Resource Development** is also a plausible step, but it is more about setting up the infrastructure needed for the attack, which is not as directly related to the immediate step before initial access.
   - **Collection** and **Discovery** are less likely because they typically occur after gaining access to the target's systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
