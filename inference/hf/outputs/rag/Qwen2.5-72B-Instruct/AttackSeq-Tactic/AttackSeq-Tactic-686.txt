### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already infected servers and are using these servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is typically used at the beginning of an attack to gain the initial foothold in the network. Since the question states that the servers are already infected, this is not the most likely next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. Given that the attackers are using the infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems. While this is a crucial part of the attack, it is not the immediate next step after spreading manually across the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. While this is a common step in an attack, it is not the immediate next step after spreading manually across the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers are performing **Lateral Movement** after using the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
