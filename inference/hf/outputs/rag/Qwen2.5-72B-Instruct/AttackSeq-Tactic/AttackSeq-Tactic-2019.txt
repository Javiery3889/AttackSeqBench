### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors used spear-phishing emails containing spoofed banking hyperlinks to compromise victims in the CIS countries.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this initial compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
   - These TTPs confirm that the initial compromise was achieved through spear-phishing emails with spoofed banking hyperlinks, which falls under the **Initial Access** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this could be a next step, it is not the most immediate or likely next step after initial access.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the victim. This is a common next step after gaining initial access, as the attacker may need to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, which typically occurs before the initial access, not after.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This is the tactic that describes the initial compromise, which has already occurred in the scenario.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails is to attempt to obtain credentials for further access and movement within the network.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is **B: Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
