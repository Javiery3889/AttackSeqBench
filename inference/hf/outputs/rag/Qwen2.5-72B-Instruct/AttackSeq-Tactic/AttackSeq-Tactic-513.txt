### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in an attack:
     - The attack starts with masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity.
     - Information is gathered for potential exploitation.
     - A malicious macro injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the initial masquerading and the injection of the malicious macro.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002 - Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the injection of the Sharpshooter downloader.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves gaining initial access to a system through a spearphishing email with an attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that occurs after the attacker has already gained control and is causing damage. This does not fit the sequence described, as the attack is still in the early stages.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the tactic where the attacker gains entry into the system. The masquerading as legitimate job recruitment and gathering information for potential exploitation are part of the initial access phase. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this initial access but before the execution of the malicious macro.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is the tactic where the attacker gathers information about the target. This fits the description of gathering information for potential exploitation, which occurs after the initial masquerading and before the execution of the malicious macro.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution is the tactic where the attacker runs malicious code. The injection of the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word is an execution technique. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is **Reconnaissance**. The attack sequence involves initial masquerading, followed by gathering information (reconnaissance), and then the execution of the malicious macro.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
