### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between two specific actions: checking the system's keyboard layout and exfiltrating screenshots via ImgBB.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001 - Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614.001 - System Language Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the language settings of the system to target specific regions or languages.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113 - Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots to gather visual information from the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the compromised system. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it is not the most likely tactic to occur between checking the keyboard layout and exfiltrating screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While execution is necessary for the initial infection, it is not the most likely tactic to occur between the two actions mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is not relevant to the actions described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's system. The related TTP T1614.001 (System Language Discovery) directly aligns with the action of checking the system's keyboard layout to target Arabic-speaking countries. This discovery step is likely to occur before the exfiltration of screenshots.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred between checking the system's keyboard layout and exfiltrating screenshots is **Discovery**.

Final Answer: D: Discovery
