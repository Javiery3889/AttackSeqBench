### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has already established communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - The next step involves sending encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with control servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - This choice aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel. Since the question mentions sending encrypted and obfuscated data to the control servers, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. It does not fit the context of sending data to control servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While the initial communication with the control servers falls under this tactic, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is sending data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. It does not fit the context of sending data to control servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the next step involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Exfiltration**
