### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.
   - The sequence of events is: 
     1. SharpHound was used for scanning and mapping targets during the Discovery phase.
     2. Command and Control was established by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes, which is a common activity during the Discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.004-IIS Components:** This technique involves modifying IIS components to maintain persistence, which can be part of the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This is the tactic that involves scanning and mapping targets, which aligns with the use of SharpHound.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which typically occurs before the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems, which typically occurs after the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which occurs after the Discovery phase and is mentioned in the question as the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the Discovery phase (using SharpHound) occurred before the Command and Control phase (deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process).

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
