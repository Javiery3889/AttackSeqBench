### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the OceanLotus Group:
     - They used a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
     - They executed commands and exfiltrated data.
     - They used HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control (C2).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:**
     - This technique involves using tunneling protocols to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic is relevant because the group used HTTP and DNS Tunneling for C2, which aligns with the techniques T1572 and T1071.004.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic is not directly relevant to the described actions, which focus on command execution and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic is relevant because the group exfiltrated data over the C2 channel, which aligns with the technique T1041.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic is not directly relevant to the described actions, which focus on command execution and data exfiltration rather than evading defenses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Exfiltration**. The group used the C2 channel for both command execution and data exfiltration, which aligns with the technique T1041.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
