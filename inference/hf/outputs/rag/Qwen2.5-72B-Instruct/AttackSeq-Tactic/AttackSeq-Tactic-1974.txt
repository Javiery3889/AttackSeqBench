### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack where the 'Piano Gh0st' malware was distributed through phishing emails with attachments.
   - The key point is to determine what tactic likely occurred after the initial entry into the targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing with attachments (T1566.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic is already described in the question as the method used to gain entry into the systems. Therefore, it cannot be the answer to what happened after the initial entry.
   - **Persistence (A):** After gaining initial access, attackers often establish persistence to maintain long-term access to the system. This is a logical next step.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** Once inside the network, attackers may move laterally to gain access to other systems within the network. This is also a plausible next step.
   - **Exfiltration (C):** Exfiltration involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attackers have established a foothold and possibly moved laterally.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sequence of events, the most logical next step after gaining initial access through spearphishing would be to establish persistence to ensure continued access to the system.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
