### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a VB macro in a malicious XLS file is executed, leading to the silent download and installation of the SunSeed malware. The next step is the establishment of a Command and Control (C2) channel via HTTP GET requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial step of opening the XLS file and executing the VB macro.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server, which aligns with the final step of the malware establishing a C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for execution, which aligns with the execution of the VB macro.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions. While it could be a part of the attack, it is not necessarily the next step after the initial execution and before establishing the C2 channel.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. It is typically an early stage of the attack and not likely to occur after the initial execution and before the C2 channel is established.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. The initial execution of the VB macro and the subsequent download and installation of the malware both fall under the Execution tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after the initial execution but before the C2 channel is established.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system. It is a logical next step after the initial execution and before the C2 channel is established, as the malware would need to ensure it can remain on the system and continue to function.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the initial execution of the VB macro and before the establishment of the C2 channel is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
