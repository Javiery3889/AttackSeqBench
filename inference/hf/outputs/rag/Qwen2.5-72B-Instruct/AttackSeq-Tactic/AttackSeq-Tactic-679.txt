### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Volatile Cedar group:
     - Scanned for exploitable vulnerabilities.
     - Used the vulnerabilities to inject web shell code into the target server.
     - Executed the Explosive Trojan's main binary and dynamically loaded DLL.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the injection of the web shell and the execution of the Explosive Trojan.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistent access to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):**
     - This is the initial step where the attacker gains access to the system by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application.
   - **Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell):**
     - This is the step where the attacker injects a web shell to maintain persistent access to the system.
   - **Execution:**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. In this context, it would be the execution of the Explosive Trojan's main binary and dynamically loaded DLL.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It typically occurs before the initial access.
   - **Impact:**
     - This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. It typically occurs after the execution of the main payload.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** The attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain initial access.
     2. **Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell):** The attacker injects a web shell to maintain access.
     3. **Execution:** The attacker executes the Explosive Trojan's main binary and dynamically loaded DLL.
   - The question asks what tactic occurred after the web shell injection and before the execution of the Explosive Trojan.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible tactic that occurred after the web shell injection and before the execution of the Explosive Trojan is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
