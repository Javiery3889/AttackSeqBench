### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the SombRAT backdoor established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to transfer the collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to communicate with the C2 server, which is already established in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication, which is also mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves transferring data over the established C2 channel, which is the next logical step after establishing communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves gathering resources to support the attack, which is not relevant to the transfer of collected data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which is already established in the question (protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP).
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker, which is the next logical step after establishing communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems, which is not directly related to the transfer of collected data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is **Exfiltration**.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
