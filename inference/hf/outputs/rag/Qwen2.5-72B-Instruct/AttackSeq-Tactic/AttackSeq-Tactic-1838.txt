### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CTU analysts sinkholed 'Tawnya Grilth' domains and redirected infected traffic to servers for logging connections and gathering statistics.
   - The key action here is the redirection of traffic to servers for logging and gathering statistics.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves the acquisition of domains for use in malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target:** This technique involves setting up a web page to exploit visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. Redirecting traffic to a server for logging does not fit this category.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - The Execution tactic involves running malicious code. Redirecting traffic to a server for logging does not involve executing code.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. Redirecting traffic to a server for logging and gathering statistics is a form of C2, as it involves maintaining control over the compromised systems to gather data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the target. While logging connections and gathering statistics can be a form of discovery, the primary action here is maintaining control over the compromised systems to gather data, which aligns more closely with C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the sinkholing and redirection of traffic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
