### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses API hooking techniques to evade detection by injecting code into a security product. The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with external entities for further communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This technique involves hooking into API functions to capture credentials, which is a form of data collection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a legitimate process to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a network. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after evading detection and establishing a backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing a communication channel with an external entity to receive commands and send data. This is a logical next step after evading detection and setting up a backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and not the immediate next step after evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While the initial step of API hooking and process injection is part of defense evasion, the question asks about the next step after the backdoor is established.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after evading detection and setting up a backdoor, the next step is to establish a command and control channel to communicate with external entities.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
