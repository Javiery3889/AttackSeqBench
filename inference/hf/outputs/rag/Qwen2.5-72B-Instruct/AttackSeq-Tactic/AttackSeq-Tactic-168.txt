### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the threat actor gains entry via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents that download base64-encoded CAB files through embedded scripts.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial entry via spear phishing.
     - Malicious documents with embedded scripts.
     - Downloading base64-encoded CAB files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is not a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. Given that the spear phishing emails contain malicious documents with embedded scripts that download and execute base64-encoded CAB files, this is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's system. While this could occur later in the attack, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described in the question as the initial entry point via spear phishing. It cannot be the next step after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actor gains initial access via spear phishing and then executes the malicious code contained in the downloaded CAB files.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
