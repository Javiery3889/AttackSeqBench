### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where system data and information (like Skype communications) have been collected and need to be sent to a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The focus is on the transfer of the stolen data, which is encrypted and sent over a specified port.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary scheduling the transfer of exfiltrated data at specific times or intervals.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the adversary using the same C2 channel to exfiltrate data that was used to control the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection** - This tactic is about gathering data from the target system, which has already been done according to the question. Therefore, this is not the correct choice.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining initial access to the target system, which is not relevant to the transfer of stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact** - This tactic is about degrading or disrupting the availability or integrity of systems, which is not relevant to the transfer of stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic is about communicating with the compromised system to control it. While it is related to the C2 server, the specific focus of the question is on the exfiltration of data, not the control itself.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant tactic for sending the encrypted stolen data traffic over a specified port to a C2 server is **Exfiltration**. The technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** specifically describes the use of the C2 channel for exfiltration, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control

However, based on the detailed analysis, the most accurate answer should be **Exfiltration**. Since the question asks for the most likely ATT&CK tactic and the related TTPs clearly point to Exfiltration, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: Exfiltration (Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)
