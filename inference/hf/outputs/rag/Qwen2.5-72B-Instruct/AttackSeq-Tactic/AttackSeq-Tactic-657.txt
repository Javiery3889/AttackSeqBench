### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT28 used spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages and before they exploited vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into victim networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials as part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spear-phishing links to trick victims into providing credentials or clicking on malicious links.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves increasing the level of access within a network. It typically occurs after initial access has been gained and is not a logical next step after harvesting credentials via spear-phishing.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to access systems. Given that the question states that credentials were already harvested via spear-phishing, this tactic would have already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not a logical next step after harvesting credentials and before exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is a logical next step after gaining initial access and before exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to move deeper into the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is **D: Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
