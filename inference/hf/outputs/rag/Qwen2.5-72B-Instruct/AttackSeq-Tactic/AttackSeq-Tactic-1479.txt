### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after BlackEnergy 3 malware leveraged a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 to target Ukrainian power facilities.
   - The key point is the sequence of events: the malware leveraged a vulnerability, and we need to determine what happened next.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office 2013) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution is the tactic that involves running malicious code on a target system. Given that the malware leveraged a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013, the next logical step would be to execute the malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the tactic that involves gaining the initial foothold in a target network. While spearphishing (T1566.001) is a common method for initial access, the question states that the malware has already leveraged a vulnerability, which implies that initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery is the tactic that involves gathering information from the target system. While this is a common next step after gaining access, it is not the most immediate action following the exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the tactic that involves maintaining long-term access to a target system. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically follows the initial execution of the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after leveraging a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 is the execution of the malicious code.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
