### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved using GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems.
   - The focus is on the initial compromise, which is a critical first step in an attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves acquiring or developing tools to support operations. This could include custom backdoors hosted on GitHub.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to deploy and run the custom backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves communicating with compromised systems to control them. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it typically comes after the initial compromise.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. Using GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems aligns well with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While obfuscation tools like Invoke-Obfuscation are used for defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the initial compromise.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. While reconnaissance is important, it is not the initial compromise.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is **Initial Access**. The use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents is a clear indicator of the initial compromise.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
