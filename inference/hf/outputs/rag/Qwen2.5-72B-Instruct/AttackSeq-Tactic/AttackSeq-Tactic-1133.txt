### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that APT42 used application layer protocols and encrypted channels for command and control communications with compromised systems.
   - The key elements here are "application layer protocols," "encrypted channels," and "command and control communications."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a command and control server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect the confidentiality of command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-standard application layer protocols for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The question does not mention any initial access techniques, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from a compromised system. The question does not mention data exfiltration, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with a compromised system to control it. The question explicitly mentions using application layer protocols and encrypted channels for command and control communications, which aligns with the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves disrupting the availability or integrity of systems. The question does not mention any impact techniques, so this is not the most likely answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is related to the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
