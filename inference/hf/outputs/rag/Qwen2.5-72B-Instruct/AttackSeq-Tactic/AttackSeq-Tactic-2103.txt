### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Suckfly has already scanned the internal network for open ports and hosts.
   - The next step involves using hacktools to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and open ports, which aligns with the initial scanning activity.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves gathering resources needed for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not align with the described sequence of scanning and privilege escalation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, which has already been done (scanning for open ports and hosts). It does not fit the next step of privilege escalation and lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the target network. The question does not mention data theft, so this does not fit the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through the network to expand the attacker's control. This aligns with the described use of hacktools to escalate privileges and traverse within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
