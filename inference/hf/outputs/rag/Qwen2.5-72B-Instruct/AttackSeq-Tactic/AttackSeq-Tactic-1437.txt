### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already established persistence using a malicious VB script and a Registry Run key.
   - The next step involves the attackers using DNS and HTTP to communicate with their C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.014-Active Setup:** This technique involves setting up persistence through the Active Setup registry key, which is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial persistence mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic is about gaining initial access to a system, which has already been achieved in the scenario described. Therefore, this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which aligns with the use of DNS and HTTP for communication with C2 servers. The related TTPs T1071.001 and T1071.004 directly support this choice.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information from the compromised system, which is not mentioned in the question. The question specifically focuses on communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic is about maintaining long-term access to the system, which has already been established through the Registry Run key and VB script. Therefore, this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used DNS and HTTP for Command and Control after establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
