### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN8 conducted domain trust discovery and gathered system information.
   - The specific techniques mentioned are:
     - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** (using `nltest.exe`)
     - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** (using `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`)

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** is part of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** is also part of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - Both techniques are used to gather information about the network and systems, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. It is typically used after initial access and discovery to ensure the attacker can return to the network.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. It is usually performed after discovery to find and access other systems.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves techniques to establish resources for use in campaigns. It is typically a pre-attack phase and not directly related to the discovery of network information.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target network and systems. The techniques mentioned (T1482 and T1018) are both part of the Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the techniques mentioned (T1482 and T1018) are part of the Discovery tactic, the most plausible sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the specific actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
