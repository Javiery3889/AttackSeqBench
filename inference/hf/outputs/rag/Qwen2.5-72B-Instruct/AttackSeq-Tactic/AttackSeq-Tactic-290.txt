### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the backdoor compressed and collected files but before the data was exfiltrated to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves compressing files using a library (like zlib) to reduce the size of the data before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending the collected data to a command and control (C&C) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It typically occurs before data collection and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. It is usually performed early in the attack to gain the necessary access to perform other actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves sending the collected data out of the network. According to the related TTPs, this is the final step after the data has been collected and compressed.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on the system. It is the first step in the attack and occurs before data collection and exfiltration.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: 
     1. Compress and collect files (Collection, T1560.002).
     2. (Unknown tactic).
     3. Exfiltrate data to C&C server (Exfiltration, T1041).
   - The unknown tactic must occur between the collection and exfiltration steps. The only logical step that fits here is the preparation for exfiltration, which is typically part of the Exfiltration tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
