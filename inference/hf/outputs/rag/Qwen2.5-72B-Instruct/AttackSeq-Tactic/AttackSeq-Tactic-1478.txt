### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Duke group securely communicated with their command-and-control (C2) server using layered encryption and encoding for managing the compromised systems.
   - The key points are:
     - Secure communication with the C2 server.
     - Use of layered encryption and encoding.
     - Managing the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques to obfuscate command and control traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control communications from being detected or intercepted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised system. While this could happen after establishing a secure C2 channel, it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending data from the compromised system to the attacker. This is a logical next step after establishing a secure C2 channel, as the attacker would want to retrieve the collected data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the network. This could also happen after establishing a secure C2 channel, but it is not as immediate as exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that the Duke group has established a secure C2 channel, so this tactic has already occurred.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after establishing a secure C2 channel is to exfiltrate data from the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
