### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities by the threat actor BlueDelta.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Discovery activities (exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather system and network information).
     - Automated exfiltration of the victim's Roundcube session cookie and database information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection):** This technique involves collecting email data from the local system.
   - **Discovery (T1518-Software Discovery):** This technique involves discovering software and system information on the victim's network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This is the initial step where the threat actor gains access to the system by exploiting a vulnerability in Roundcube webmail software. This is the starting point of the attack sequence.
   - **Discovery (T1518-Software Discovery):** After gaining initial access, the threat actor conducts discovery activities to gather system and network information. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection):** This technique involves collecting email data, which is a form of data collection. This could be a step before exfiltration, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the question.
   - **Command and Control (T1105-Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It is typically used to control the compromised system and exfiltrate data.
   - **Resource Development (T1583-Establish Accounts):** This tactic involves developing resources, such as establishing accounts, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal on Host):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which could be relevant but is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Initial Access (exploiting Roundcube webmail software).
     2. Discovery (gathering system and network information).
     3. Exfiltration (automated exfiltration of session cookie and database information).
   - The most plausible tactic that fits between discovery and exfiltration is **Collection**. This is because the threat actor would likely collect the necessary data (such as the session cookie and database information) before exfiltrating it.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Collection
