### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a macro in a lure document is enabled, which triggers malicious PowerShell commands. The next step involves the use of obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the obfuscation and payload delivery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker using a malicious file (e.g., a document with a macro) to execute code on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Obfuscation of scripts is a common method of defense evasion. However, this tactic is more likely to occur after the initial execution of the malicious file and PowerShell commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques that adversaries use to steal and transfer data from a victim's network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems over extended periods. While persistence can be established after initial access, it is not the most likely tactic to occur immediately after enabling a macro and executing PowerShell commands.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. The use of a lure document with a macro is a common method of initial access. This fits the sequence described, as the macro is enabled, leading to the execution of PowerShell commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the Initial Access tactic occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
