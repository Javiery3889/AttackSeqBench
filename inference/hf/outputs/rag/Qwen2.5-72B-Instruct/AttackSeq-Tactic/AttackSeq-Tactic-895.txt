### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker gains initial access by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker uses POWERSHOWER to collect system information from infected machines.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and collecting system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Office) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is already described in the question as the initial step where the attacker gains access by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This tactic aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique, which is the next logical step after gaining initial access. The attacker would need to discover system information before using POWERSHOWER to collect more detailed information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it could be relevant in a broader attack sequence, it is not the most likely next step immediately after gaining initial access and before collecting system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker performs **Discovery** after gaining initial access and before collecting system information.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
