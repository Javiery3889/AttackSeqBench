### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Bitter APT group.
   - The group used spear-phishing emails with weaponized maldocs to exploit known vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through phishing (T1566) and specifically through spear-phishing with attachments (T1566.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (D):** The spear-phishing emails with weaponized maldocs are part of the Initial Access tactic. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Discovery (A):** After gaining initial access, the next logical step is often to discover the environment to understand the network, systems, and potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. It typically follows discovery.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It can occur after initial access but is often established during the initial stages of the attack.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question asks which tactic most likely occurred **after** the initial access via spear-phishing.
   - Given the sequence of events, the most logical next step after gaining initial access is to perform discovery to understand the environment.

### Final Answer: A: Discovery
