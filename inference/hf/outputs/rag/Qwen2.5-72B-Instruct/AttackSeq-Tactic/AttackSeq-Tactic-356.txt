### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CostaRicto Campaign using the SombRAT backdoor.
   - The actions include process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
   - The gathered information is then archived using a custom storage file format.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The described actions (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) are not typically part of the initial access phase. Initial access usually involves techniques like spear-phishing, drive-by compromises, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system. While the question mentions archiving the gathered information, the primary focus is on the discovery of system information, which is a prerequisite for collection.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. The described actions do not align with resource development.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. The described actions (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) are all part of the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the **Discovery** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
