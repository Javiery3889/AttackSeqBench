### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers gain access by delivering malware via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
   - After gaining access, the malware executes a polymorphic self-copied file from the %Temp% folder with a randomized name.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the malware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves the attacker deleting files to cover their tracks and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic is about gaining initial access to a system. The question already states that the attackers gained access by delivering malware via a file, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Execution (A):** This tactic involves the actual execution of the malware. The question mentions that the malware is executed, but this is part of the initial access and execution sequence, not something that happens after gaining access and before the polymorphic file execution.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The related TTPs mention file deletion, which is a common defense evasion technique. This is a plausible tactic that could occur after gaining access and before the polymorphic file execution to cover tracks and evade detection.
   - **Collection (D):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system. While this could occur after gaining access, it is not as directly related to the sequence described in the question, which focuses on the execution and evasion aspects.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining access and before the polymorphic file execution is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
