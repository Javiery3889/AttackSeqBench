### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before WinDealer processed and staged stolen data in the %TEMP% folder by collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications.
   - The key actions mentioned are:
     - Collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications.
     - Staging the stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Collection**
     - **Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging**
   - This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or accounts. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs before the collection and staging of data.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, such as network configuration and details from SNS applications. This is a logical step before collecting and staging data.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is usually an early step in the attack lifecycle and not directly related to the collection and staging of data.
   - **D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system, which aligns with the action of collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications. The related TTP (T1074.001 - Local Data Staging) is part of the Collection tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred before the Collection and staging of data. Discovery is necessary to understand the target environment and identify the data to be collected.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
