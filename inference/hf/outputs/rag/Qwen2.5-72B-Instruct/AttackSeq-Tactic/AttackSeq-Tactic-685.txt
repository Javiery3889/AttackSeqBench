### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Explosive Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords and then is configured to spread via USB infection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic likely occurred before the USB infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, such as passwords.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also about capturing keystrokes to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the malware to control it. While important, it is not directly related to the sequence of gaining access and spreading via USB.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While keylogging can be a form of persistence, it is not the primary focus of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. The USB infection is a method of lateral movement, so this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves avoiding detection. While keylogging can be a form of defense evasion, it is not the primary focus of the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The keylogging (T1056.001) is used to gain administrator passwords, which is part of the **Credential Access** tactic.
   - After gaining the credentials, the malware is configured to spread via USB, which is a method of **Lateral Movement** (T1091).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the malware first gains access to the credentials and then uses the USB infection to spread.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
