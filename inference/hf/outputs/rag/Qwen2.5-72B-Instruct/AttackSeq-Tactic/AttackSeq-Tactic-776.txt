### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Regin, a sophisticated malware, has executed multiple modules to perform tasks while avoiding detection.
   - The focus is on the final step where Regin cleans traces of its presence and blends in with the system’s memory pools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute code, which can help in evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This technique involves removing persistence mechanisms to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker’s infrastructure. It does not align with the described action of cleaning traces and blending in with the system’s memory pools.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While Regin does execute modules, the question specifically asks about the final step of cleaning traces.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The related TTPs (T1070-Indicator Removal, T1218.011-Rundll32, T1070.009-Clear Persistence) all fall under the Defense Evasion tactic and align with the described action of cleaning traces and blending in with the system’s memory pools.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the infection. It does not align with the described action of cleaning traces and blending in with the system’s memory pools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described action is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
