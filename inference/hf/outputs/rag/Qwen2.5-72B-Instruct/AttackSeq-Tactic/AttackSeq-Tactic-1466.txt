### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where employees were socially engineered to enable macros, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware. After this, the adversaries used BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic facilitated communication between the malware and an external server before the credential harvesting and lateral movement began.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using spearphishing to gather information about the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access to the target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with systems they control within a target network to manage the execution of their objectives.
     - Given that the question asks about communication between the malware and an external server, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gain information about the system and network.
     - While discovery is important, it does not directly facilitate communication with an external server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data.
     - This is not relevant to the communication between the malware and an external server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gather data of interest to their goal.
     - While collection is important, it does not directly facilitate communication with an external server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the Command and Control (C2) tactic, as it directly facilitates communication between the malware and an external server.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
