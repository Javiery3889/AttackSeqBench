### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, network configuration, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. Since the malware is already installed, this is not the most likely next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is typically done before the malware is installed, not after.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step, it is often established during the initial compromise or immediately after installation.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities. This is a logical step to take after the malware is installed and before it starts collecting specific data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is **Discovery**. The malware would likely need to gather information about the system to understand what data is available and how to collect it effectively.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
