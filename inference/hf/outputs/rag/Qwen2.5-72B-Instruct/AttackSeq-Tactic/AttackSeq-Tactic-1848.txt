### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after BlueDelta collected emails by automatically forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address and before it exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a victim's system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves the use of email accounts to support the attacker's operations, such as setting up forwarding rules.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up rules to automatically forward emails to an attacker-controlled address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - The technique T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule is part of the Collection tactic. This aligns with the step where BlueDelta collected emails by setting up forwarding rules.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the victim's system. It does not directly relate to the collection or exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - The technique T1586.002-Email Accounts is part of the Resource Development tactic. This involves setting up the necessary resources (email accounts) for the attack, but it does not directly fit the sequence of collecting and exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - The technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration is part of the Exfiltration tactic. This aligns with the step where BlueDelta exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves collecting emails by setting up forwarding rules (Collection) and then exfiltrating the session cookie and address book (Exfiltration).
   - The step that logically fits between these two actions is the Command and Control tactic, which involves maintaining control over the victim's system to facilitate the exfiltration process.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
