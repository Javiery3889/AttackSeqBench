### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Bankshot implant was executed by downloading and running a DLL implant from a malicious domain, but before it began evading detection by wiping files and content from the targeted system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files and content to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the DLL search order to ensure that a malicious DLL is loaded.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it could be part of the attack sequence, it is not directly related to the execution of the DLL or the subsequent file deletion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. It is not directly related to the execution of the DLL or the subsequent file deletion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. The question states that the DLL implant was already executed, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. The related TTPs include DLL Search Order Hijacking, which is a method of persistence. This tactic fits well between the execution of the DLL and the file deletion, as the attacker would likely want to ensure that the implant remains on the system before attempting to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker executed the DLL implant, then established persistence, and finally evaded detection by deleting files.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
