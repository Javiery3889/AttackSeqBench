### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents. The DOCX documents utilized the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves using a remote template to inject malicious code into a document, which can be used to execute additional stages of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spear-phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** The spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents are part of the initial access phase. However, the question asks what happens after this initial access.
   - **Execution (A):** After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malicious code or payload. The remote template technique (T1221) is used to inject and execute the next stage of the attack.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** Lateral movement typically occurs after the initial access and execution phases, when the attackers have established a foothold and are looking to move to other systems within the network.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** Exfiltration is the process of stealing data and sending it out of the network, which usually occurs after the attackers have gained access, executed their payload, and possibly moved laterally.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible next step after the initial access via spear-phishing and the use of the remote template technique is the execution of the malicious payload.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
