### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial steps of the attack, which involved phishing links, executable malware downloads, and malvertising to deliver the Bottle Exploit Kit to victims' systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary compromising a website to deliver malicious content to a victim's system when they visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The techniques mentioned (T1204.001 and T1189) are both part of the Initial Access tactic. However, the question asks about what happens **after** these initial access techniques are used.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the victim's system. After gaining initial access through phishing links and malvertising, the next logical step is to execute the delivered malware.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically follows the initial execution of the malware.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. Reconnaissance is usually a pre-attack activity and does not fit the context of what happens after initial access and execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access through phishing links and malvertising is the execution of the delivered malware.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
