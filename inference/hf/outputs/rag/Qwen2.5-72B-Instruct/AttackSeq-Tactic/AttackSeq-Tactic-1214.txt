### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred before the attackers used commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `Get-NetComputer` during the computer profiling phase to gather information on the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker checking the system time, which is often part of the initial reconnaissance to understand the environment.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker identifying the system owner and user, which is crucial for understanding the context of the system and the users who have access to it.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating accounts. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the commands mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining the credentials needed to access systems. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the commands used for gathering information about the system and network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. It typically occurs after the initial compromise and gathering of information, not before.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. The commands `whoami`, `net user`, and `Get-NetComputer` are used to discover system information, user accounts, and network objects, which aligns perfectly with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the attackers used the mentioned commands to gather information on the network.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
