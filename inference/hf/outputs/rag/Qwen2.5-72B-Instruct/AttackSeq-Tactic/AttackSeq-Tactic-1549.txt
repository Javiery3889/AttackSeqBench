### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers first gather information about the victim's computer (OS version, username, anti-virus details) and then use a backdoor to exfiltrate data (files and screenshots) over a C2 (Command and Control) channel.
   - We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique describes the process of exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the final action of sending exfiltrated data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as OS version, username, and anti-virus details, which aligns with the initial action of gathering information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While it is relevant to the C2 channel used for exfiltration, it does not fit the sequence of actions described between gathering information and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While it is related to the initial information gathering, it is not the most specific tactic for the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It does not fit the sequence of actions described, as there is no mention of moving to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It fits well with the sequence described, as the attackers are collecting data (files and screenshots) before exfiltrating it.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between gathering system information and exfiltrating data is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
