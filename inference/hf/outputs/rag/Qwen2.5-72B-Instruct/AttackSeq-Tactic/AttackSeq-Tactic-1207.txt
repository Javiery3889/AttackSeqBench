### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where BlueBravo's malware has already gathered system information (username, computer name, network connections, and running processes).
   - The next step involves enabling HTTPS communication that is encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure necessary to support operations, such as setting up servers or domains. It does not align with the described sequence of enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which has already been done according to the question. It does not align with the next step of enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While this might be part of the overall attack, it does not specifically address the step of enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with the malware to control it. The related TTP T1132.001-Standard Encoding specifically mentions using standard encoding techniques to obfuscate C2 communications, which aligns with the described step of enabling HTTPS communication with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
