### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurs before additional shellcode is downloaded via communication with the C&C server, after privilege escalation is achieved using the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process, often used for privilege escalation.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system, often involving downloading additional payloads or shellcode.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over a compromised system. The technique T1104 (Multi-Stage Channels) is directly related to downloading additional shellcode via communication with a C&C server, which fits the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on downloading additional shellcode.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic is already mentioned as being completed using the Metasploit module. The question asks about what happens after privilege escalation, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C&C servers. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
