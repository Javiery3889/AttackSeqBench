### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved delivering malicious documents with filenames related to current events, such as 'COVID-19 travel restrictions EU reviews list of third countries.exe'.
   - The key points are:
     - Delivery of malicious documents.
     - Filenames related to current events.
     - The documents are executable files (`.exe`).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This technique involves naming malicious files to appear legitimate, which aligns with the use of filenames related to current events.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves executing a malicious file, which is consistent with the `.exe` file mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as creating malicious documents. However, it does not directly involve the delivery or execution of these documents.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which can include delivering malicious documents to users. The use of filenames related to current events to trick users into opening the documents fits well with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is a step that occurs after the initial access. While the execution of the `.exe` file is part of the attack, the question specifically asks about the delivery of the malicious document.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials, which is not directly related to the delivery of malicious documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the **Initial Access** tactic, as it directly relates to the delivery of malicious documents with filenames designed to trick users into opening them.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
