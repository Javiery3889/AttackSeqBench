### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the adversaries exploited misconfigured Docker API ports to gain access to victim environments.
   - The context involves the development of infrastructure, including botnet-linked IPs and malicious containers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying malicious containers to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1611-Escape to Host:** This technique involves escaping from a container to gain higher privileges on the host system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up botnet-linked IPs and malicious containers. However, this is a preparatory step and not directly related to gaining access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the victim's environment. The related TTP (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) aligns with the scenario of exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports to gain access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves increasing the adversary's privileges within the victim's environment. The related TTP (T1611-Escape to Host) is a step that would occur after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the development of infrastructure and is not directly related to the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is **B: Initial Access**. The exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports is a method of gaining initial access to the victim's environment.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
