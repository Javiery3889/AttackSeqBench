### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the deployment of njRAT malware, the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to collect Kavach authentication databases, and the extensive use of modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Credential Access** and the technique is **T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**.
   - This suggests that the primary focus is on obtaining credentials, particularly from web browsers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the described sequence of credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques used to gain a foothold in the network, such as spear-phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities. The question already describes the deployment of malware, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques used to steal and transfer data out of the network. After collecting credentials and authentication databases, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial part of the attack, it is typically established earlier in the attack sequence, not after credential harvesting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after credential harvesting and browser password stealing is **Exfiltration**.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
