### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial step in an attack sequence where the attacker uses RTF files with embedded exploits to gain a foothold on victims' computers through spear phishing emails.
   - The final step in the sequence involves using the cloud-based WebDAV protocol for command and control via CloudMe.com.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or open files, which can be used to run malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, such as RTF files, to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This choice aligns with the technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is used to gain initial access to the victim's system by sending malicious RTF files via spear phishing emails.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time, which is not the initial step in the attack sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it, which is the final step in the sequence described (using WebDAV for command and control).
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system, which is not the initial step in the attack sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the initial step involves gaining access to the victim's system through spear phishing emails with malicious RTF files.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
