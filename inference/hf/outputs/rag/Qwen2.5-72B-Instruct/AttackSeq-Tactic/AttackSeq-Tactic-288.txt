### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already established persistence by creating a new service for its loader.
   - The next actions involve compressing files with zlib and notifying the C&C about newly inserted removable media.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service):** This technique involves creating a new service to maintain persistence on the system.
   - **Initial Access (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media):** This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Collection (T1560.002-Archive via Library):** This technique involves compressing files using a library (e.g., zlib) to prepare them for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves sending data out of the network. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions compressing files and notifying the C&C, which are more aligned with the Collection and Command and Control (C2) tactics.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system. Compressing files with zlib is a clear indication of data collection, as it prepares the data for potential exfiltration.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The question does not mention any activities related to gathering information about the target.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. While discovery could occur before collection, the question specifically mentions compressing files, which is more aligned with the Collection tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of compressing files with zlib and notifying the C&C, is the Collection tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
