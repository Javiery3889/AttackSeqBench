### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where OceanLotus distributed a backdoor via a zip file containing a disguised Microsoft Word document application bundle, leading to its execution.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the backdoor was distributed and the user opened the malicious file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the backdoor.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment that, when opened, leads to the execution of the backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves increasing the privileges of the attacker to gain higher access levels. This is typically a step that occurs after the initial execution of the backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target environment. The distribution of the backdoor via a zip file and the user opening it is part of the initial access phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** This tactic involves the actual running of the backdoor. The question states that the backdoor was executed after the user opened the malicious file.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target. This is typically a step that occurs after the initial execution of the backdoor.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the sequence where the backdoor was distributed and then executed. The execution of the backdoor is the next logical step after the user opens the malicious file.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is the one that aligns with the execution of the backdoor.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
