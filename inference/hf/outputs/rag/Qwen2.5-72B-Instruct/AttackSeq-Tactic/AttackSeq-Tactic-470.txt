### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects were used to target high-ranking diplomats and academic researchers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.002-Email Addresses):** This technique involves gathering email addresses of potential targets, which is a pre-attack activity.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to the target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (B):** This tactic is typically used before the attack to gather information about the targets. It is not a likely next step after the spear phishing emails have been sent.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. After the spear phishing emails with infected documents are opened, the next logical step would be the execution of the malicious code.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic is already part of the described scenario (spear phishing emails). It is the initial step, not the next step.
   - **Defense Evasion (A):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it can occur after initial access, it is not the most immediate next step after the spear phishing emails are opened.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the spear phishing emails containing infected document files are opened, the next step is the execution of the malicious code.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
