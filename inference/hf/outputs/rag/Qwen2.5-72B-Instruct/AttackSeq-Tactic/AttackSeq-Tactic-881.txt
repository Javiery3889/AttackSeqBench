### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers have already gathered network information using tools like ADFind and port scanning.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves propagating beacons to other systems within the company's network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which aligns with the initial gathering of network information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the network configuration, which also aligns with the initial gathering of network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems, which has already been done using ADFind and port scanning. Therefore, this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is not directly related to the propagation of beacons to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not the primary focus of propagating beacons to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems, which aligns with the propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gathering network information and port scanning is to move laterally through the network to other systems.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
