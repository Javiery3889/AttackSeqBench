### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Darkhotel APT gained initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware disguised as legitimate software updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear legitimate by using a name or location that matches a legitimate one.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a victim's system by having them visit a website that contains malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This could include identifying the software used by hotel guests, which is a plausible step before creating a drive-by compromise.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to a system. This is typically a step that occurs after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. This is a post-compromise activity and does not fit the context of gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up a malicious website or creating malware. This is a plausible step before the initial access, but it is more specific to the preparation phase rather than the immediate precursor to the attack.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that the attackers would first gather information about the target (Reconnaissance) to understand what software the hotel guests are using. This information would then be used to create a drive-by compromise (Initial Access) by disguising malware as legitimate software updates.

### Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
