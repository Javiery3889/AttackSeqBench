### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater initially gains access through spear-phishing attacks targeting various sectors in Middle Eastern countries.
   - After gaining initial access, MuddyWater uses a web control server and an infiltration tool named muddyc3 for managing their operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing links to gain initial access to a target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question specifically mentions the use of a web control server and an infiltration tool, which are more aligned with command and control activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. The use of a web control server and an infiltration tool (muddyc3) for managing operations strongly suggests that the next step after gaining initial access is to establish command and control.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access has already been established through spear-phishing. Therefore, this answer choice is not applicable for the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a target network. While persistence is a common next step, the question specifically mentions the use of a web control server and an infiltration tool, which are more aligned with command and control activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing, MuddyWater would establish command and control using a web control server and the muddyc3 tool.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
