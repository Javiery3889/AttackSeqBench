### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the harvested documents were automatically uploaded to the C&C server.
   - The key phrase is "before Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automatic collection of data from the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - C2 is about establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is crucial for the overall attack, it is not directly related to the specific action of uploading harvested documents.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence:**
     - Persistence is about maintaining long-term access to the victim's system. While important, it does not directly relate to the action of uploading harvested documents.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data from the victim's system to an external location. The related TTPs (T1020 and T1041) specifically mention automated exfiltration and exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the question's context.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance is about gathering information before an attack. While it is a crucial initial step, it does not directly relate to the action of uploading harvested documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the exfiltration of harvested documents occurred before they were uploaded to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
