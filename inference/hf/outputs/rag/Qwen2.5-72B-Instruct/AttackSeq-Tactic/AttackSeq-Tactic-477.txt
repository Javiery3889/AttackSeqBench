### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses the DNS protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication and then receives commands to execute actions, specifically stealing Outlook passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This indicates that the attacker is using DNS for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This suggests that the attacker might also use mail protocols for C2, but the question specifically mentions DNS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing data and sending it out of the network. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically asks about the next action after receiving commands to steal Outlook passwords, which is more aligned with the initial stages of the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Stealing Outlook passwords could be part of defense evasion, as it helps the attacker maintain access and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers. This is typically done before the attack, not after receiving commands.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic is already part of the initial sequence described in the question. The question asks about the next step after receiving commands, so this is not the correct answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after receiving commands to steal Outlook passwords is **Defense Evasion**. Stealing credentials is a common technique used to maintain access and avoid detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
