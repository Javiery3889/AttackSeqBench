### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have employed anti-analysis features such as code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, and process hollowing. After these steps, the attackers coordinated multiple operations using specific domains (axroot.com and adobeair.net).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves the use of domains for various purposes, such as command and control (C2) or exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is used to detect and evade virtualized environments and sandboxes, which aligns with the anti-virtualization mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - While the anti-analysis features (code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, and process hollowing) are part of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the next step after these features are employed.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - The use of specific domains (axroot.com and adobeair.net) for coordinating multiple operations strongly suggests that these domains are being used for command and control (C2) purposes. This aligns well with the T1583.001-Domains technique.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - The T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion technique is part of the Discovery tactic, but the question is asking about the next step after the anti-analysis features are employed, which is more likely to be C2.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential access is not directly related to the use of domains for coordination, which is the focus of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after employing anti-analysis features, the attackers used the domains for command and control.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
