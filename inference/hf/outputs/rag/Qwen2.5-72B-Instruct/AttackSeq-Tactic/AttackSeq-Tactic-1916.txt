### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the NanHaiShu malware:
     - It communicates with C&C servers using HTTP POST to upload system information.
     - It uses HTTP GET to download JScript and VBScript code.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next to transfer sensitive data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring additional tools or malware to the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - This aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel. Given that the malware has already established communication with the C&C server and downloaded additional scripts, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is a common tactic, the question specifically asks about the transfer of sensitive data, which is more aligned with exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already mentions that the malware has established C&C communication, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target. The question implies that the malware has already gathered and uploaded system information, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware would next exfiltrate sensitive data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Exfiltration**
