### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through a phishing email containing a malicious XLS file.
   - The attackers then gained persistence using an MSI package that installed a malicious Lua script and established autorun via an LNK file.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the persistence was established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**
     - This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial access through the phishing email containing the malicious XLS file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation (T1068, T1078, etc.) involves increasing the attacker's level of access within the system. This is typically done after gaining initial access and before establishing persistence, but it is not a necessary step in every attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance (T1595, T1592, etc.) involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is usually done before gaining initial access, not after.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence (T1547, T1574, etc.) involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. This is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution (T1204, T1059, etc.) involves running malicious code on the target system. This is the step that occurs immediately after gaining initial access through the phishing email and before establishing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the attackers gained persistence is **Execution**. The malicious XLS file was executed, leading to the installation of the malicious Lua script and the establishment of autorun via an LNK file.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
