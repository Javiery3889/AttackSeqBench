### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that Crimson RAT was successfully deployed and began keylogging and stealing browser credentials.
   - We need to determine the next ATT&CK tactic in the attack sequence after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This indicates that the keylogging activity is part of the Collection tactic.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This indicates that the keylogging activity can also be part of the Credential Access tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This is a plausible next step because keylogging and stealing browser credentials are directly related to obtaining credentials, which is a key aspect of the Credential Access tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This is less likely to be the next step immediately after keylogging and stealing credentials. Command and Control typically involves establishing communication with the attacker's infrastructure, which would usually come after initial access and credential collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This is not a plausible next step because Initial Access is the first stage of the attack, and the question implies that the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This is also not a plausible next step because Execution typically involves running malicious code, which has already been done with the deployment of Crimson RAT.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible next step after keylogging and stealing browser credentials is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
