### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used watering hole tactics with specific exploits (CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782) to compromise websites and deliver malware.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the initial compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial tactic used was **Initial Access** with the technique **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.
   - This technique involves compromising a website that the target is likely to visit, and then delivering malware to the target when they visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This is the tactic that describes the initial compromise, which is already described in the question. Therefore, it cannot be the answer to what happened **after** the initial compromise.
   - **Execution (A):** After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the delivered malware. This is a common follow-up action to ensure the malware runs on the target system.
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target system. While this can occur after initial access, it is not the immediate next step after the initial compromise.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves stealing data from the target system. This is typically a later stage in the attack sequence, after the attacker has established a foothold and possibly obtained credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after the initial access via a watering hole attack is the **Execution** of the delivered malware.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
