### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Bandook loader uses defense evasion techniques (switching external templates and using digitally signed payloads) and then injects a malicious payload.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after the payload injection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012 - Process Hollowing:** This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221 - Template Injection:** This technique involves modifying templates to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This is already part of the initial sequence (switching external templates and using digitally signed payloads). The question asks for the next step, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - After injecting a malicious payload, the next logical step is to establish communication with the C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the malware remains on the system after the initial infection. While this is a common next step, it typically follows the establishment of a C2 connection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system. This is usually an early step in the attack lifecycle, not typically following payload injection and C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after payload injection is establishing communication with the C2 server, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
