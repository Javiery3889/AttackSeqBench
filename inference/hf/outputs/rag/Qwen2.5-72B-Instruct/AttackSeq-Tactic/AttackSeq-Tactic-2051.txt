### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has collected information from an iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. The next step is to send this data out via HTTP and receive commands from the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically sending collected data to an attacker-controlled server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data out over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for exfiltration and receiving commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It does not fit the scenario of sending data out and receiving commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it and receive data. This fits the scenario of sending data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves establishing resources to support operations. It does not fit the scenario of sending data out and receiving commands.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system. It does not fit the scenario of sending data out and receiving commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described, the most plausible answer is **B: Command and Control**. This tactic aligns with the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel and the receipt of commands from the attacker.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
