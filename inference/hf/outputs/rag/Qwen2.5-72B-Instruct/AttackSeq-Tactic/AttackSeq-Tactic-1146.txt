### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Turla group.
   - The sequence starts with PowerShell scripts bypassing antimalware scanning capabilities through AMSI patching.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the operators used backdoors to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This technique involves disabling or modifying tools to evade detection, which aligns with the initial action of bypassing antimalware scanning capabilities.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering file and directory information, which is the action the operators take after using backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's network. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after bypassing antimalware.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment, such as file and directory information. This aligns well with the described action of gathering file and directory information or monitoring USB drives.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**: This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the victim's systems. This is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's network. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate action after bypassing antimalware and before gathering file and directory information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the operators first bypassed antimalware scanning capabilities (Defense Evasion), and then used backdoors to gather file and directory information (Discovery).

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
