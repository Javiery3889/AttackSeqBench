### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when KiraV2 exploited vulnerabilities in IoT devices such as MVPower DVR and Huawei routers before executing DDoS attacks and distributing itself to other IoT devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.008-Network Devices:** This technique involves the adversary gaining access to network devices to use them for malicious purposes.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves the adversary using a malicious link to execute code on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves the adversary gaining access to a system by exploiting a vulnerability in a web application or service that the user visits.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution (T1204.001-Malicious Link):**
     - This technique involves the adversary using a malicious link to execute code on a victim's system. However, the question is about the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities in IoT devices, not the execution of code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network and identify potential targets. While this is a crucial step, it is not the initial access point.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - This technique involves the adversary gaining initial access to a system by exploiting a vulnerability in a web application or service. This aligns well with the scenario of exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary moving from one system to another within a network. This is a subsequent step after gaining initial access, not the initial exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with the initial access to the IoT devices by exploiting vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
