### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before cybercriminals developed and sold hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers accompanied by training services on the Chinese underground market.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the supply chain to introduce malicious hardware or software into the target environment.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.001-Malware:** This technique involves developing or acquiring malware for use in an attack.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves developing or acquiring malware for use in an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - **T1588.001-Malware** and **T1587.001-Malware** both fall under the Resource Development tactic. These techniques involve the development or acquisition of malware, which is a crucial step before selling hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers. The development of malware is often a prerequisite for creating and selling such hardware, as the malware can be used to control or manipulate the hardware.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. While this is an important early stage in many attacks, it is not directly related to the development and sale of hardware.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. This is typically a later stage in an attack and does not align with the development and sale of hardware.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the target. This is a later stage in an attack and does not align with the development and sale of hardware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the cybercriminals first developed the necessary resources, including malware, before they could develop and sell hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers.

**Final Answer: A: Resource Development**
