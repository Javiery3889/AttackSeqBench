### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where login credentials have been stolen using the OnionDuke malware.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the compromised system’s information (e.g., presence of antivirus software or a firewall) was gathered.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the specific technique is **T1518.001 - Security Software Discovery**.
   - This technique involves the adversary discovering security software and configurations on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs after initial access and credential access.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to steal credentials, which has already been mentioned as occurring with the OnionDuke malware. Therefore, this is not the next step.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the compromised system, such as the presence of security software. This aligns with the related TTPs and the question.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information before the initial compromise. Since the system is already compromised and credentials have been stolen, this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred after the credentials were stolen and before the system’s security information was gathered.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
