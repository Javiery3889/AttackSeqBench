### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first gather information through social engineering techniques (phishing and supply chain compromise) and then gain access by exploiting unprotected MongoDB databases and compromised Citrix systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic likely occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending fraudulent communications to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the target's systems and networks to support the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the actual attack. The related TTP (T1592) fits well here, as it describes gathering victim host information.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target's systems. The related TTPs (T1195 and T1566) fit this stage, as they describe supply chain compromise and phishing.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This does not fit well with the sequence described in the question.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target's systems. This would occur after gaining initial access, not before.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the adversaries first gathered information (Reconnaissance) before using social engineering techniques to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the tactic that likely occurred after gathering information and before gaining access is **Reconnaissance**.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
