### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider. This link leads to the execution of the EVILNUM malware, which then runs a headless Javascript agent disguised as decoy business files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the malware.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which then leads to the execution of the malware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising the malware to avoid detection, such as by using decoy business files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target system. While this might occur at some point in the attack, it is not the most likely initial step described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running the malware. However, the question specifically asks about the step before the malware is executed.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining entry into the target system. The scenario describes the victim being enticed to follow a link, which is a common method for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target system. This is not the initial step described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the victim was enticed to follow a link, which is a method of initial access.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
