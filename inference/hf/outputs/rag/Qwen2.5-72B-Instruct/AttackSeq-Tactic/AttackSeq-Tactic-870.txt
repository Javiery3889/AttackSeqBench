### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where 'Energetic Bear' compromised a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack in a watering hole campaign.
   - The next step involves harvesting credentials via a modified image URL redirecting to a file protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic is already covered by the drive-by compromise (T1189) mentioned in the related TTPs. The initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Lateral Movement (A):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. The question does not mention any movement within the network.
   - **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question specifically mentions harvesting credentials via a modified image URL redirecting to a file protocol, which aligns with credential access.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves techniques to steal data. The question does not mention any data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
