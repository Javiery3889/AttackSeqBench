### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving a JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) that fingerprints the infected system and a backdoor (KopiLuwak) that communicates with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the backdoor (KopiLuwak) uses HTTP POST requests to communicate with compromised websites.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This indicates that the JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) is used to execute commands on the infected system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript):** This is the initial step where the JavaScript dropper executes commands to fingerprint the system.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):** This is the final step where the backdoor communicates with compromised websites.
   - We need to identify the tactic that fits between these two steps.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This is already part of the initial step where the JavaScript dropper executes commands.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the system and network. Fingerprinting the system by executing commands and saving the output to a temporary file aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this could be relevant, it is not the most immediate next step after fingerprinting.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. While this could be relevant, it is not the most immediate next step after fingerprinting.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic (B) occurred after the JavaScript dropper fingerprinted the system and before the backdoor communicated with compromised websites.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
