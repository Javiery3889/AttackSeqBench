### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands, and injecting processes on remote computers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen password hashes to authenticate to remote systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH to access remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While defense evasion is a common follow-up to lateral movement, the question specifically asks about what occurred after the lateral movement, not what was done to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, the question focuses on what happened after the lateral movement, not the communication methods.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. Impact is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after the attacker has achieved their objectives through lateral movement and other tactics.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand the attacker's control. The question already states that lateral movement has occurred, so this answer choice does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **B: Command and Control**. After successfully using Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement and executing commands on remote computers, the next logical step would be to establish or maintain command and control over the compromised systems.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
