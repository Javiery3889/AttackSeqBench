### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Lazarus group maintained communication with command and control (C2) servers through backdoor malware that executed remote commands during the FEIB heist.
   - The key points are:
     - The group maintained communication with C2 servers.
     - They used backdoor malware to execute remote commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves having alternative communication methods in case the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. It is typically used in the initial stages of an attack, not after maintaining C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or compromise data integrity. While this could occur after maintaining C2, it is not the most immediate next step after establishing and maintaining C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it is typically part of the initial compromise and not the next step after maintaining C2.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The related TTPs (T1104, T1102.002, T1008) all fall under the Command and Control tactic and describe the methods used to maintain and manage the C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Lazarus group continued to use Command and Control techniques to maintain and manage their communication with the compromised system.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
