### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials and then uploads files with specific extensions to a C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur before the exfiltration of the files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files with specific extensions.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending the collected data to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:** This technique involves stealing web session cookies, which is relevant to the initial part of the question where the backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of data.
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is relevant to the initial part of the question where the backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials. However, the question asks about the tactic that occurs before the exfiltration of files.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. While it is a necessary step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of specific files.
   - **Collection (D):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is directly related to the step where files with specific extensions are collected before being exfiltrated.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurs before the exfiltration of files is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
