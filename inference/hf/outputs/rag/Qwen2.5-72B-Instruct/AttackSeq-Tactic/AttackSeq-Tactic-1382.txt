### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the TeamTNT threat group.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Downloaded and executed a coin miner payload.
     2. Tracked infected hosts using iplogger.org.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from the C2 server to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution (T1059) involves running malicious code. This is likely what happened when the coin miner payload was executed, but it doesn't fit the sequence after the payload execution and before tracking infected hosts.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery (T1046) involves gathering information about the system and network. This could be relevant, but it doesn't align well with the context of tracking infected hosts using a web service.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves maintaining communication with the compromised system. This fits well with the use of web services (T1102) and tool transfer (T1105) to track infected hosts.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration (T1041) involves stealing data from the victim's system. This is not relevant to the context of tracking infected hosts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the coin miner payload was executed, the attackers used Command and Control techniques to track the infected hosts using iplogger.org.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
