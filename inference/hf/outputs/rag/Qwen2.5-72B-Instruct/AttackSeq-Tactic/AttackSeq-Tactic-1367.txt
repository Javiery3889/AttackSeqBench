### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks using exploited external servers and deployed web shells as a gateway.
   - The key points are:
     - Establishing a foothold.
     - Using exploited external servers.
     - Deploying web shells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves maintaining access to a system by using a web shell, which is a script that can be uploaded to a web application to enable a persistent backdoor.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves gaining access to a network by exploiting external remote services, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or other services that allow remote access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before an attack. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the initial access is established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is more likely to occur after initial access has been established.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving through a network to expand access. This typically occurs after the initial foothold has been established.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial access involves gaining the first foothold in the victim's network. This aligns with the use of exploited external servers and deploying web shells as a gateway.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the initial access tactic occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks using exploited external servers and deployed web shells as a gateway.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
