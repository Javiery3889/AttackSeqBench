### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has already collected data such as keystrokes, clipboard data, and account information from the victim's device.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with a remote IP address to deliver the collected information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves capturing data from the clipboard to gather sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this is a crucial step in the initial stages of an attack, it does not describe the communication with a remote IP address.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's system and network. While important, it does not describe the communication with a remote IP address.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system, which has already been described in the question. Therefore, this is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing communication with a remote server to control the malware and exfiltrate data. This aligns with the scenario described in the question, where the malware needs to send the collected data to a remote IP address.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the data is collected, the next step is to establish communication with a remote IP address to deliver the collected information, which falls under the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
