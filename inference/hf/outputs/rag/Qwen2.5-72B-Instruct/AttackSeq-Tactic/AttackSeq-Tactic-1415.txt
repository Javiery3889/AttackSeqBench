### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Smooth Operator has already collected operating system details and domain values from `config.json`.
   - The next step involves using multiple randomly chosen HTTPS C2 servers with a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is consistent with the use of HTTPS C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which is not directly relevant to the next step described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system, which has already been done (collecting OS details and domain values).
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves moving data out of the target network, which aligns with the use of HTTPS C2 servers and custom encoding for obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system, which is not directly related to the described use of C2 servers for data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the target system to control it, which is a prerequisite for exfiltration but not the next step in the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that the next step involves exfiltration over a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
