### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the backdoor loaded the encrypted configuration file, decrypted it, and used SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to communicate with C&C servers, often to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over a compromised system. The use of SSL to connect to C&C servers is a part of this tactic, but it is not the initial step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The encryption of the configuration file (T1027.013) is a defense evasion technique. This step must occur before the backdoor can use the encrypted file to connect to C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. While execution is a critical step, it is not specifically mentioned in the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence is important, it is not directly related to the sequence of loading and decrypting an encrypted configuration file.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the backdoor first used a defense evasion technique to encrypt the configuration file, and then used the encrypted file to connect to C&C servers. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the backdoor loaded the encrypted configuration file is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
