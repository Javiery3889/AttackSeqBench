### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an obfuscated VBScript named 'PlayList.vbs' is executed using 'wscript.exe'.
   - After execution, the script is deleted to evade detection before communicating with the C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to have occurred during the deletion of the VBS script.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic for scripting and execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. Deleting a script to evade detection does not align with persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The related TTP T1070.004 (File Deletion) directly aligns with this tactic, as it involves deleting files to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to spread to other systems. Deleting a script to evade detection does not align with lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. Deleting a script to evade detection does not align with credential access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP T1070.004 (File Deletion) and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the tactic of Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
