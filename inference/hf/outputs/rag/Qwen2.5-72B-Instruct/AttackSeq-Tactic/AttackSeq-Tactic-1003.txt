### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before WINDSHIFT sent emails mimicking legitimate password recovery or reset requests to harvest credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link):** This technique involves gathering information to identify potential targets and craft spearphishing emails.
   - **Resource Development (T1586.002-Email Accounts):** This technique involves creating or acquiring email accounts to use in attacks.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This technique involves using spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access has been gained and is not a prerequisite for sending spearphishing emails.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a network over time. It is usually a follow-up action after initial access and is not a prerequisite for sending spearphishing emails.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. It is a logical first step before sending spearphishing emails, as it helps in identifying and targeting specific individuals.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining access to a network. While spearphishing can be a method of initial access, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before sending the emails, which aligns more with reconnaissance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is that reconnaissance occurred before WINDSHIFT sent the spearphishing emails.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
