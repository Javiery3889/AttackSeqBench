### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after macOS threats like ChromeLoader and Operation In(ter)ception established mechanisms such as Chrome extensions or LaunchAgents for maintaining long-term access on infected systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions:** This technique involves using browser extensions to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique involves using LaunchAgents to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique involves using LaunchAgents to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - Discovery involves gathering information from the system, which is typically done before or during the initial stages of an attack, not after establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the system, which is the first step in an attack and not something that occurs after establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence** - Persistence involves maintaining long-term access to the system, which aligns with the use of Chrome extensions and LaunchAgents as described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution** - Execution involves running malicious code, which can occur at various stages of an attack but is not specifically about maintaining long-term access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: Persistence**.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
