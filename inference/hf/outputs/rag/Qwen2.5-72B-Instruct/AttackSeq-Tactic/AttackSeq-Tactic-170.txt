### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a batch file is executed to install the main payload.
   - After the payload is installed, the malware gains elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary attempting to map the network, identify system configurations, and gather information about the environment. This is not directly related to gaining elevated privileges or bypassing UAC.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While the batch file execution is part of the initial steps, the question specifically asks about what happens after the payload is installed.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is not relevant to the post-installation steps described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves the adversary gaining higher-level permissions on the system. The related TTPs specifically mention bypassing UAC, which is a technique used to gain elevated privileges. This aligns perfectly with the question's description of the malware gaining elevated privileges after the payload is installed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Privilege Escalation**.

**Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation**
