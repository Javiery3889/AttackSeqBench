### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after GreyEnergy operators gained credential access using tools like Mimikatz and before they established internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves setting up internal proxies to redirect command and control (C&C) traffic.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation (T1068) involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this could be a step in the attack sequence, it is not the most likely next step after gaining credential access and before setting up internal C&C proxies.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (T1105) involves establishing communication with the attacker's infrastructure. However, the question specifically mentions setting up internal C&C proxies, which is a more specific and later step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement (T1534) involves moving from one system to another within the network. This is a logical step after gaining credential access and before setting up internal C&C proxies, as the attackers would need to spread within the network to establish control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access (T1003) involves obtaining credentials, which has already been mentioned as a step the attackers have completed using tools like Mimikatz.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining credential access and before setting up internal C&C proxies is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
