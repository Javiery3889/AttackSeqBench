### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the BlackEnergy 3 malware:
     - Harvesting credentials and expanding access across the corporate network.
     - Blending into regular traffic.
     - Using stolen credentials to disrupt electricity distribution by seizing control of operator workstations in the control environment.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the credentials were harvested and before the disruption of electricity distribution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to extract credentials.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending data out of the network. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as the question does not mention data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised network. This is a plausible step after gaining access and before disrupting the control environment, as the adversaries would need to maintain control to execute their plans.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems. This is a plausible step after gaining access and before disrupting the control environment, as the adversaries would need to understand the network to target the control environment effectively.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials. This is already part of the initial phase described in the question (harvesting credentials), so it does not fit the sequence of events after the initial access and before the disruption.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the credentials were harvested and before the disruption of electricity distribution is **Command and Control**. This is because the adversaries would need to maintain control over the network to execute their plans.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
