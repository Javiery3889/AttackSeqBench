### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol for remote code execution without leaving artifacts on disk and then established three primary IP addresses for their C&C infrastructure.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute remote code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange):** This is the initial step where the DDE protocol is exploited to execute remote code.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS):** This is the final step where the attacker establishes communication with the C&C infrastructure using DNS requests.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. It is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it could be relevant, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit the sequence as clearly as the other options.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Exploit DDE protocol for remote code execution (Execution).
     2. Establish C&C infrastructure (Command and Control).
   - The question asks what occurred between these two events. Given the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that fits between these two events is **Defense Evasion**. This is because after gaining initial execution, the attacker would likely attempt to evade detection before establishing the C&C infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
