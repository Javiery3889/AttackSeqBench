### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a self-extracting wrapper file is used to conceal the Gh0st payload and execute the embedded DLL of the Trojan.
   - After these initial steps, the malware establishes communication using a custom network protocol through a server hosted at 98.126.67.114.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding a payload within another file to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. The question does not mention any actions related to privilege escalation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the initial steps (self-extracting wrapper and embedded DLL) are related to defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is establishing communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. The question explicitly mentions that the malware established communication using a custom network protocol, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure to support operations. The question does not mention any actions related to resource development.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the establishment of communication with the C2 server, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
