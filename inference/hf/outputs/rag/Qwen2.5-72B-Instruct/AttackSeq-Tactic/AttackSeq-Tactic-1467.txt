### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where adversaries first conducted internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems and then used malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves scheduling tasks or jobs to execute at a later time, which can be used to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials for future use, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to gather information or gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**: This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or network denial of service. This is likely the final step in the attack sequence, not the step between reconnaissance and using malicious updates.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After reconnaissance, adversaries might need to establish command and control to execute further actions, but it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which is already part of the reconnaissance phase. However, discovery can also occur after initial reconnaissance to gather more detailed information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. After conducting internal reconnaissance, adversaries might use the gathered information to move laterally within the network to reach the control center and substations.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after conducting internal reconnaissance, the adversaries would use the gathered information to move laterally within the network to reach the control center and substations. This lateral movement would be necessary to position themselves to use malicious updates to sever connections.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
