### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the OceanLotus group.
   - They used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - They then exfiltrated data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This indicates that the attackers used stolen credentials to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This suggests that the attackers used pass-the-hash to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This indicates that the attackers obtained credentials by dumping them from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While it is a crucial initial step, it does not fit the sequence described, which is post-credential theft and pre-data exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is important, it does not directly fit the sequence of using stolen credentials and moving laterally.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. The use of pass-the-hash and pass-the-ticket techniques aligns with lateral movement.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While pass-the-hash can be used for defense evasion, the primary focus in the question is on moving to new machines, which is more aligned with lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that the attackers used stolen credentials to move laterally within the network before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
