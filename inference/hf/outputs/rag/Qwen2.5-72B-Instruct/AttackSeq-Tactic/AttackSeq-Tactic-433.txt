### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Gamaredon group:
     - They used COVID-19-themed phishing emails to distribute malicious documents.
     - They applied obfuscation techniques within their VBS script to delete itself after execution.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves using phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves using phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (D):**
     - The initial access is achieved through the use of phishing emails with malicious documents (attachments or links). This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Execution (C):**
     - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malicious payload. This would involve running the VBS script.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):**
     - Obfuscation techniques to delete the VBS script after execution are part of defense evasion tactics. This is done to avoid detection and analysis.
   - **Impact (A):**
     - Impact tactics are typically the final stage of an attack, where the attacker achieves their goal (e.g., data exfiltration, system destruction).

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Initial Access**: Phishing emails with malicious documents.
     2. **Execution**: Running the VBS script.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation techniques to delete the VBS script after execution.
     4. **Impact**: (Not mentioned in the question, but would be the final step if the attack proceeds further).

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that the **Execution** tactic occurred after the initial access and before the defense evasion. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
