### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an APT group used a malicious DLL payload to establish a remote connection back to a server with a specific IP address and port.
   - The key elements are:
     - Malicious DLL payload
     - Remote connection to a server
     - IP address and port

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the establishment of a remote connection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to access systems. This is not directly related to the establishment of a remote connection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves maintaining control over a compromised system, which aligns with the establishment of a remote connection to a server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from a compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the establishment of a remote connection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**. The establishment of a remote connection to a server is a clear indicator of Command and Control activity.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
