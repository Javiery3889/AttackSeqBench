### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where InstallUtil.exe is used for defense evasion, and a malicious payload is injected into memory.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to determine the ATT&CK tactic based on the payload's communication pattern with the attacker-controlled server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.007-Msiexec**: This technique involves using Msiexec, a legitimate Windows utility, to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system by communicating with it. Given that the payload is communicating with an attacker-controlled server, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions communication with the server, which is more indicative of C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While this could be a later step, the question does not mention data theft, only communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic has already been used in the initial steps (using InstallUtil.exe and process injection). The question is asking about the next step, which is not defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the communication pattern with the attacker-controlled server, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic is Command and Control (C2).

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
