### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 used WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations.
   - The context is that FIN13 has already performed internal reconnaissance and gathered information on network configurations and services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure and tools. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle but does not directly follow internal reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target network, systems, and users. This aligns with the internal reconnaissance and gathering of network configurations and services mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through the network to access additional systems. This is a logical next step after gathering information and setting up execution capabilities.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry into the target network. This is typically the first step in the attack lifecycle and does not follow internal reconnaissance.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that FIN13 has already performed internal reconnaissance and gathered information, the next logical step would be to use this information to move laterally within the network.
   - The use of WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations is a clear indication of lateral movement.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
