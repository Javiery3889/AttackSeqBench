### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Stuxnet:
     - Employed rootkit functionality for hiding its presence.
     - Used stolen digital certificates to sign its kernel-mode drivers for evasion.
     - Exploited the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred while exploiting these vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems on the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using stolen digital certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit:**
     - This technique involves using rootkits to hide the presence of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - While Stuxnet did use rootkits and stolen digital certificates for defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred while exploiting vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code, but it does not specifically address the spreading of the malware across networked systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to spread to other systems, which aligns with the exploitation of the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems, but it does not specifically address the spreading of the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
