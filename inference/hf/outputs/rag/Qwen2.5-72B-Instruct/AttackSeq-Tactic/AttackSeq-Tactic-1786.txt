### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Elise malware moves its payload to a specific directory and then executes the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they are in, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information. This does not align with the described action of moving a payload and executing it.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, the described action of moving and executing a payload does not directly indicate C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves the adversary ensuring they can maintain access to the system over time. While moving a payload to a specific directory could be a step towards persistence, the described action of executing the DLL by injecting it into a process is more aligned with another tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves the adversary trying to avoid detection and analysis. The technique T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection is specifically listed under the Defense Evasion tactic. Injecting a DLL into a legitimate process like Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) is a common method to evade detection by security software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described action, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Elise malware used Defense Evasion to execute the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
