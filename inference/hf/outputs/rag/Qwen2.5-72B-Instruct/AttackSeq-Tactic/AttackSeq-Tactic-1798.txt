### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the RTM APT group.
   - The initial access was gained through phishing emails or exploiting unprotected resources.
   - After gaining initial access, the group used packers as a service to complicate detection by security tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This confirms that the initial access was gained through phishing.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing:** This indicates that the group used software packing to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While it is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question specifically mentions the use of packers to complicate detection, which is more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This tactic is already covered by the phishing technique (T1566). The question is asking about what happened after initial access was gained.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools. The use of packers (T1027.002) is a clear example of defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. The question does not mention any reconnaissance activities after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is **C: Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
