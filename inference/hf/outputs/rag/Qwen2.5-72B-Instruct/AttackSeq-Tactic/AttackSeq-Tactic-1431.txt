### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the StellarParticle campaign used specific tools (AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools) to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which is a common step in the discovery phase to understand the network topology.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves identifying trusted domains, which helps in understanding the relationships between different parts of the network and can be used to identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the actual attack. The question states that the campaign has already gathered Active Directory information and identified systems, which suggests that the reconnaissance phase is already complete.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target network. The question implies that the campaign has already gained some level of access to gather information, so this is not the most likely next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, which aligns with the use of AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems. The related TTPs (T1018 and T1482) are both under the Discovery tactic, further supporting this choice.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain further access. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after gathering Active Directory information and identifying systems, which is more aligned with the Discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred after the StellarParticle campaign used the specified tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
