### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker has already gained initial access to servers V1 and V2 by compromising them with backdoors.
   - The next step in the sequence is the establishment of a covert communication channel using BPF and RSA algorithms.
   - The question specifically asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred during the transfer of sensitive operations via V2's SMB service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols to communicate with the command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it is a crucial part of an attack, it does not specifically describe the transfer of sensitive operations via SMB.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. It is not directly related to the transfer of sensitive operations via SMB.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact** - This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. It is not relevant to the transfer of sensitive operations via SMB.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. The related TTPs T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer both fall under the Lateral Movement tactic and directly describe the use of SMB for transferring sensitive operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of SMB for lateral movement to transfer sensitive operations.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
