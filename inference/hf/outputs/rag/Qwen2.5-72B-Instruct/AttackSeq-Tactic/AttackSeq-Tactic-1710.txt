### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has established persistence using a scheduled task running the `mshta.exe` utility.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the attacker has used a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This reinforces that the scheduled task is being used to execute the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions. While it might be a part of the attack, it is not the next logical step after establishing persistence and before establishing communication.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic has already been established in the scenario using a scheduled task.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing communication with remote servers to control the compromised system and exfiltrate data. This aligns with the next step described in the question.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving to other systems within the network. While it might be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after establishing persistence and before establishing communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after establishing persistence, the attacker would establish Command and Control to communicate with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
