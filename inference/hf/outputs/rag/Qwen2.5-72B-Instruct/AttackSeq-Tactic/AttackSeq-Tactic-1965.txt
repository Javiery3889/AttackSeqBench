### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that KiraV2 periodically communicates with its C&C server to receive attack commands.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to disrupt the availability of targeted services through DDoS attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1498-Network Denial of Service:** This technique involves disrupting network availability by overwhelming the target with traffic.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service:** This technique involves disrupting the availability of specific endpoints by overwhelming them with traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic is about establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is already mentioned that KiraV2 communicates with its C&C server, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact:** This tactic involves the actual disruption of the target's services, which aligns with the DDoS attacks described in the question. The related TTPs (T1498 and T1499) are both under the Impact tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. Since the question states that the attack commands are already being received, this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. While this could be a part of a broader attack, it is not directly related to the DDoS attack described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Impact tactic, as it directly involves the disruption of targeted services through DDoS attacks.

**Final Answer: B: Impact**
