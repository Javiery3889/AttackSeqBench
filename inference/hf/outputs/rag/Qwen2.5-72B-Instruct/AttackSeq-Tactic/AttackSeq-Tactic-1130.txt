### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT42 conducted internal reconnaissance by accessing the victim organization's collaborative spaces and before stealing credentials and performing follow-on operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering information about credentials during the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement (T1534-Internal Spearphishing) is a technique used to move from one system to another within the network. This could occur after reconnaissance but is more likely to happen after the attacker has already gained some level of access and is looking to expand their presence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery is a tactic that involves the attacker gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This is a logical step after reconnaissance and before stealing credentials, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to identify valuable targets.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the theft of data from the victim's network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has already gained access, performed reconnaissance, and possibly lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This could occur after reconnaissance and before stealing credentials, as the attacker might need higher privileges to access sensitive information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sequence described in the question, the most logical step after conducting internal reconnaissance and before stealing credentials is to perform Discovery. This allows the attacker to gather more detailed information about the network and identify potential targets for credential theft.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
