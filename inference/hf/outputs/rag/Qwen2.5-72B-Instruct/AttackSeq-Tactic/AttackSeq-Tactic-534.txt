### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the persistence was established using the RAT 'IvizTech' and before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not the most likely step between maintaining persistence and collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. The related TTP T1082-System Information Discovery directly aligns with the use of the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' to collect detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this could be relevant, it is not the most likely step between maintaining persistence and collecting system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred after the persistence was established and before the reconnaissance tool collected detailed information about the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
