### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT, the downloading of a malware configuration file, and the exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the deployment of the RAT and the exfiltration of data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where data is exfiltrated using the SmartFTP Client. It cannot be the tactic that occurred between the deployment of the RAT and the exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in an attack, where the attacker gains entry into the network. This does not fit the sequence described, as the RAT has already been deployed.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This could occur after the RAT is deployed and before exfiltration, but it is not the most likely tactic given the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a crucial step after deploying the RAT and before exfiltration, as the attacker needs to communicate with the compromised system to control it and prepare for data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT and before the exfiltration of data is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
