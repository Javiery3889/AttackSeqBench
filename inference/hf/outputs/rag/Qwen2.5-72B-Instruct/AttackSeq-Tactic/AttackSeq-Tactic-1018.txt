### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers used obfuscation techniques (aaencode algorithm and loaders like Buer and Smoke) to download payloads.
   - After this, the Raccoon stealer communicated with encrypted C&C servers distributed via the Telegram channel 'blintick'.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or information, making it harder for defenders to detect or analyze the malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information that were previously obfuscated or encoded.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation Techniques (aaencode algorithm and loaders like Buer and Smoke):** These are used to obfuscate the payloads, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic, specifically the **T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File** technique.
   - **Raccoon Stealer Communicating with C&C Servers:** This involves the stealer communicating with command and control servers, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - **Intermediate Step:** The question asks what tactic occurred between the obfuscation and the C&C communication. Given the related TTPs, the most logical intermediate step would be the deobfuscation or decoding of the obfuscated payloads, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic, specifically the **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers used obfuscation techniques to download payloads, then deobfuscated or decoded these payloads, and finally, the Raccoon stealer communicated with the C&C servers.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between the obfuscation and the C&C communication is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
