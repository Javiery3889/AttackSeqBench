### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the XAgent app, after running in the background on iOS 7 devices or exhibiting diminished functionality in iOS 8, collects data such as geo-location and text messages.
   - The data is then sent out via HTTP POST requests to the C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the data was sent out.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data back to the C2 server using the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves sending data over an unencrypted, non-C2 protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system. While discovery is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs before the app is running and collecting data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is not directly related to the data collection and exfiltration described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. While privilege escalation can be important, it is not directly related to the data collection and exfiltration described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The related TTPs indicate that the data is sent via HTTP POST requests to the C2 server, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the data was sent out. The app likely received commands from the C2 server to collect and exfiltrate the data.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
