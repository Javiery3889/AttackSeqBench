### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has used credential-stealing modules targeting Windows Explorer and has monitored IIS network traffic to collect administration data.
   - The next step in the sequence is to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves monitoring network traffic to capture credentials and other sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes and their details, which can help the attacker understand the system's state and identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from a system, but the question specifically asks about locating processes and memory utilization, which is more about understanding the system's state rather than collecting data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system, such as running processes and memory utilization, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the initial compromise, which is not relevant to the post-compromise actions described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which has already occurred in the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using credential-stealing modules and monitoring network traffic, the attacker would use the **Discovery** tactic to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
