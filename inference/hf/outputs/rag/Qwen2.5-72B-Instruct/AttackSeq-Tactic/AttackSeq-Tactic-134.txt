### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FamousSparrow acquired domains and servers for infrastructure but before exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to gain access to victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application" are relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target network and systems. This typically occurs after gaining initial access to the network.
     - **Not a fit** because the question specifies that the tactic occurred before exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.

   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the target network. The technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is a method of initial access.
     - **Not a fit** because the question specifies that the tactic occurred before exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.

   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the attack, such as acquiring domains and servers.
     - **Fit** because the question mentions that FamousSparrow acquired domains and servers for infrastructure, which aligns with the Resource Development tactic.

   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems.
     - **Not a fit** because this typically occurs after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Resource Development occurred after acquiring domains and servers for infrastructure and before exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities to gain access to victim systems.

**Final Answer: C: Resource Development**
