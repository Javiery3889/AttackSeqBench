### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group.
   - The group used dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases.
   - After this, the group scanned the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the scanning of the local system, network shared drives, and removable media.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automated methods to collect data, which could also align with the scanning activity.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves retrieving credential-related databases, which aligns with the use of dumpers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system and network. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, the question specifically mentions the use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases, which is more aligned with Credential Access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which aligns with the scanning of the local system, network shared drives, and removable media. However, this is the action that occurs after the use of dumpers.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases. This is the action that occurs before the scanning.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It does not align with the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the use of dumpers and the scanning of the local system, network shared drives, and removable media is **Credential Access**.

Final Answer: C: Credential Access
