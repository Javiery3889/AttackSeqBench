### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the FriarFox browser extension evaded detection, accessed user data, modified Firefox settings, and then contacted a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging collected data in a central location or remote system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information from the browser, such as browsing history, cookies, and other data.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making a malicious file or process appear legitimate to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic is relevant because the malware evaded detection to access user data and modify Firefox settings. However, the question specifically asks about the action of contacting a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which is more aligned with another tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - This tactic is relevant to the initial stages of the attack where the malware accesses user data. However, the question is asking about the communication with a remote server, which is not primarily a collection activity.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves the malware communicating with a remote server to receive commands or additional payloads. The question specifically mentions that the malware contacted a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the malware. The question does not mention any impact or damage, only the communication with a remote server to retrieve a payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware contacted a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
