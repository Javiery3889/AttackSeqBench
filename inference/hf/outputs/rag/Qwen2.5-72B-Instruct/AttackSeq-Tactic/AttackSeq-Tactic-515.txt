### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through malicious documents containing macros that injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word's memory.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before persistence was ensured by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into a template or document to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves ensuring that a malicious binary is executed at system startup by placing it in the startup folder or registry run keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where the second-stage binary is placed in the startup folder to ensure persistence. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This is a plausible choice because after gaining initial access and injecting the Sharpshooter downloader into Word's memory, the next logical step is to execute the downloader to download the second-stage binary.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - This is less likely because the question does not mention any movement to other systems or networks.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - This is not relevant to the sequence described, as impact typically refers to the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred before persistence was ensured is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
