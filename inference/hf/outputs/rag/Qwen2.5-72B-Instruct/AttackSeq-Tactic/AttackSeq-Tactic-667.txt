### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into system processes and before employing multiple layers of security evasion.
   - The key points are:
     - Process hollowing was used to load executables.
     - Multiple layers of security evasion were employed afterward.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:**
     - This indicates that process hollowing is a technique used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:**
     - This indicates that process hollowing can also be used for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that involves actions to disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is not likely to occur between process hollowing and security evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information to plan future actions. This is typically an early stage in an attack and is unlikely to occur after process hollowing and before security evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to a system. While this could occur after process hollowing, it is not the most likely next step before employing multiple layers of security evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is the most logical next step after process hollowing, as the attacker would want to ensure that their actions remain undetected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker used process hollowing for defense evasion and then employed additional layers of security evasion.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after process hollowing and before employing multiple layers of security evasion is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
