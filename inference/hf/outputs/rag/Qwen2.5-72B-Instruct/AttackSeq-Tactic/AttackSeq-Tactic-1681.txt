### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the adversary gained initial access through credential stuffing or password spraying and before they achieved persistence by loading a Cobalt Strike beacon on high-uptime systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.003-Password Spraying**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing**
   - These techniques are used to gain initial access by attempting to log in with stolen or guessed credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. It is typically performed after gaining access and establishing a foothold.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the adversary gaining access through credential stuffing or password spraying.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is a logical next step after gaining access and before achieving persistence.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. It is often used to execute the initial payload or further tools, but it is not typically the step between gaining access and achieving persistence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Initial Access** (Credential Stuffing or Password Spraying)
     2. **Command and Control** (Establishing control over the system)
     3. **Persistence** (Loading Cobalt Strike beacon on high-uptime systems)
   - Therefore, the most logical step between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is establishing command and control.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
