### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers used spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links to gain initial access.
   - The attackers utilized an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending emails with links that, when clicked, lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending emails with attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically asks about what happens after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the victim's environment. The question describes the use of spear phishing, which is a method of initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection aligns with this tactic, but it is not the primary focus of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The question does not mention any reconnaissance activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that the attackers used spear phishing to gain initial access. The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection is a part of the initial access phase, but the primary focus is on gaining access.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
