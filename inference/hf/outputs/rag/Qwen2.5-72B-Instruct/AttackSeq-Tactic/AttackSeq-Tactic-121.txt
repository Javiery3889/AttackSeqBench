### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of the 'Surtr' malware through the creation of a new process with the `CreateRemoteThread` function and before the malware went on to list file directories on the victim computer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the malware's presence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves listing file directories to gather information about the victim's file system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The related TTP (T1070.004-File Deletion) fits this tactic, but it is not necessarily the most likely step to occur immediately after execution and before directory listing.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system. While persistence is a common goal, it is not typically the immediate next step after execution and before directory listing.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. The execution has already occurred (using `CreateRemoteThread`), so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the victim. The related TTP (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) fits this tactic and is the next logical step after execution and before any further actions like defense evasion or persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the malware performed reconnaissance by listing file directories after it was executed and before any other actions like defense evasion or persistence.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
