### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Whitefly:
     - Network mapping
     - Infection of further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities
     - Exfiltration of large volumes of information over time
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the infection and exfiltration phases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data in a remote location before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation:** This technique involves exploiting applications or systems to gain access or cause damage.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - C2 is typically established early in the attack to maintain control over the compromised systems. It is unlikely to occur after the infection and before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense evasion techniques are used to avoid detection and can occur at various stages of the attack. However, the question does not provide specific evidence that defense evasion was a primary focus between infection and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is a logical step after initial infection and before exfiltration, as the attacker would need to spread to other systems to gather more data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised systems. This is a necessary step before exfiltration, as the attacker needs to collect the data they intend to exfiltrate.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the infection and exfiltration phases is **Collection**. The technique T1074.002-Remote Data Staging, which is part of the Collection tactic, aligns well with the need to gather and stage data before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
