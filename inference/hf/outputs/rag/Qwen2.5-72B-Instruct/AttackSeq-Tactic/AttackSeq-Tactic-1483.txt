### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the BlackEnergy 3 malware used anti-debugging techniques to evade defenses and before it gathered network information for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - Anti-debugging techniques (Defense Evasion)
     - Gathering network information (Discovery)

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to execute code, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique is listed under the Discovery tactic, but it is actually a sub-technique of Defense Evasion. It involves evading detection by timing actions to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to avoid detection, which aligns with the anti-debugging techniques mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. This is not directly related to the sequence of evading defenses and gathering network information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information from the system, which aligns with the step of retrieving network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access other systems. This is a step that would occur after gathering network information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware used anti-debugging techniques (Defense Evasion) and then gathered network information (Discovery) before moving laterally.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred after evading defenses and before lateral movement is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
