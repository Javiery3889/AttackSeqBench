### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a threat actor uses RTF documents to exploit Microsoft Word vulnerabilities. This results in the dropping of 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder, which requires a relaunch of Word for full execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using add-ins to maintain persistence, ensuring that the malicious code runs every time the application (in this case, Word) is launched.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves increasing the privileges of the current user or process. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after dropping the file and requiring a relaunch.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. This is typically an early stage and not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system. The described sequence already involves initial access through the RTF document, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code. The question states that the 'intel.wll' file is dropped into the Word startup folder and requires a relaunch of Word for full execution. This aligns with the Execution tactic, as the next step is to ensure the malicious code is executed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Execution tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
