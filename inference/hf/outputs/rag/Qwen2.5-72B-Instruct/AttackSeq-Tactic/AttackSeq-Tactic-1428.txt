### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before StellarParticle established persistence using credential hopping and configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
   - The key points are:
     - **Persistence** was established.
     - **Credential hopping** was used.
     - **WMI persistence** was configured.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.003 - Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription:**
     - This technique involves setting up WMI event subscriptions to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.003 - Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription:**
     - This technique can also be used for privilege escalation, but the primary focus here is on persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the adversary gaining the initial foothold in the network. This typically happens before any persistence mechanisms are set up.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the tactic that involves maintaining access to the system. The question already states that persistence was established, so this cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network. This is often a step taken after gaining initial access and before setting up persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is typically done before the initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is likely:
     1. **Initial Access** - The adversary gains access to the system.
     2. **Discovery** - The adversary explores the system to understand its environment.
     3. **Credential Hopping** - The adversary moves laterally using stolen credentials.
     4. **Persistence** - The adversary sets up WMI persistence using TrailBlazer malware.

   - Given that the question asks about the tactic that occurred before persistence, the most plausible answer is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
