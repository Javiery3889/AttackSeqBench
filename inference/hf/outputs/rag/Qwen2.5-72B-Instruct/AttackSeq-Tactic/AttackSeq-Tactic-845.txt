### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in an attack:
     - **Initial Event:** Longhorn's malware conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery for espionage purposes.
     - **Final Event:** Communicating with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
   - **Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it doesn't specifically fit the sequence described.
   - **B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This is a logical step after discovery and before C2 communication, especially for espionage purposes.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. This is the initial event described in the question, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. While this could be part of the attack, it is not necessarily the next step after discovery and before C2 communication.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery, the next logical step in an espionage attack would be to collect the data that was discovered.
   - Once the data is collected, the malware would then communicate with the C2 server to exfiltrate the data.

### Final Answer: B: Collection
