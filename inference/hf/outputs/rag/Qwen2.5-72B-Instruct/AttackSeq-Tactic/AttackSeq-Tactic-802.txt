### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers:
     - Exploited Exchange Server vulnerabilities via ProxyLogon.
     - Uploaded a webshell for high-privilege access.
     - Established persistence with a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image'.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the upload of the webshell and the establishment of persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using existing remote services to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves using Windows services to escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. This is not directly related to the sequence described, which focuses on gaining and maintaining access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to the system. The question states that persistence was established with a Windows system service, which aligns with the T1543.003 technique.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves degrading or disrupting the availability or integrity of systems. This is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While this is a crucial step, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after gaining high-privilege access and before establishing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers, after gaining high-privilege access via the webshell, would then establish persistence using a Windows service. Therefore, the tactic that occurred between these two steps is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
