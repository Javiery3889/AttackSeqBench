### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the malware (POWERSHOWER) has already collected system information and sent it to the C2 server.
   - The next step is that POWERSHOWER enters a communications loop, receiving instructions via a GET request status code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication between the malware and the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data (like system information) from the infected machine to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This is the most likely answer because the question mentions that POWERSHOWER is receiving instructions via a GET request status code, which is a form of command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which has already occurred in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which has also already occurred (collecting system information).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before POWERSHOWER entered a communications loop.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
