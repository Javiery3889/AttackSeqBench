### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after DarkHydrus used sandbox detection and PowerShell obfuscation techniques (which are part of the Defense Evasion tactic) and before RogueRobin established communication with the C2 server using a custom DNS tunneling protocol (which is part of the Command and Control tactic).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Command and Control tactic is involved, specifically the technique T1071.004 (DNS).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. It is not directly related to the sequence described, which focuses on evading defenses and establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The question mentions sandbox detection and PowerShell obfuscation, which are part of Defense Evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after these techniques were used.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. The question mentions establishing communication with the C2 server using a custom DNS tunneling protocol, which is a Command and Control technique.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. It is not directly related to the sequence described, which focuses on evading defenses and establishing C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after DarkHydrus used sandbox detection and PowerShell obfuscation techniques (Defense Evasion), the next step would be to establish communication with the C2 server (Command and Control).

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
