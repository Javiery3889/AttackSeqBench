### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Gamaredon group used scripting (Batch files and VBScript) to execute payloads from C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
   - These techniques are all part of the **Execution** tactic, which involves the adversary running malicious code on a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this is a common tactic, it typically occurs after initial access and execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution is the tactic that directly involves running malicious code, which aligns with the use of scripting to execute payloads.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in the victim's network. This typically occurs before execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This typically occurs after initial access and execution.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the use of scripting to execute payloads. Since the use of scripting to execute payloads is part of the **Execution** tactic, the most likely preceding tactic would be **Initial Access**. This is because the adversary needs to gain initial access to the system before they can execute any scripts or payloads.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
