### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malicious emails containing trojaned attachments were sent to Tibetan organizations.
   - After the emails were sent, the 'Surtr' malware was executed by injecting itself into a newly created explorer or iexplore process.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, typically through user interaction (e.g., opening an email attachment).
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. The related TTP T1204.002 (Malicious File) aligns with this tactic, as it describes the execution of a malicious file.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact** - This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial access to a victim's system, typically through phishing or other means. While the initial access might have been through the malicious emails, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred after the emails were sent and before the malware execution.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. Malicious emails containing trojaned attachments are sent.
     2. The user opens the attachment, leading to the execution of the malicious file (T1204.002).
     3. The 'Surtr' malware is executed by injecting itself into a newly created explorer or iexplore process (T1055).
   - The tactic that fits between the sending of the emails and the execution of the malware is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
