### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers used tools like Medusa and Fast SYN Scanner to enumerate services, fingerprint SMTP servers, and authenticate on VNC and RDP ports.
   - The key actions here are:
     - Enumerating services
     - Fingerprinting SMTP servers
     - Authenticating on VNC and RDP ports

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the technique is **T1046-Network Service Discovery**.
   - **Discovery** is the tactic where an adversary attempts to map the network and identify services and systems to understand the environment better.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which typically happens before the actions described in the question. The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting, and authenticating) are more about exploring the network and systems, not gaining initial access.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The actions described are more about discovery and reconnaissance, not command and control.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While the actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting, and authenticating) are part of reconnaissance, the related TTPs specifically mention the **Discovery** tactic.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves the adversary mapping the network and identifying services and systems. The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting SMTP servers, and authenticating on VNC and RDP ports) align perfectly with the **Discovery** tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
