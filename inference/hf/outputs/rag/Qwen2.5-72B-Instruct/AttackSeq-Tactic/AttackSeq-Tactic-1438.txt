### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials and then redirect users to a YouTube clip posted by a persona.
   - The key elements are:
     - Fictitious login sites (phishing)
     - Collection of credentials
     - Redirect to a YouTube clip

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts:**
     - This technique involves compromising existing accounts to gain access to resources.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:**
     - This technique involves collecting credentials for reconnaissance purposes.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585-Establish Accounts:**
     - This technique involves creating new accounts to use in future operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems or accounts.
     - Given that the fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment.
     - While collecting credentials can be part of discovery, the primary focus here is on the collection of credentials, not the discovery of the environment.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis.
     - Redirecting users to a YouTube clip could be a form of defense evasion, but it is not the primary focus of the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems.
     - The described sequence does not indicate any command and control activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is **Credential Access**. The fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials, which aligns directly with the Credential Access tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
