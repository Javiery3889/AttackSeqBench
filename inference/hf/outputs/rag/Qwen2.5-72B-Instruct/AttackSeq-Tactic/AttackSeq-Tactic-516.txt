### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the execution of the Rising Sun implant payload using `CreateProcessA()` and `ShellExecuteA()`, and before the reconnaissance activities like fetching network adapter info and OS product name from the registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the system for specific information, which aligns with the reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the registry, which is also part of the reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell for execution, which is not directly relevant to the reconnaissance activities but could be part of the execution phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves gathering resources needed for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves sending data out of the network. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question, which focuses on reconnaissance activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the system. While it could occur after execution, it is not directly related to the reconnaissance activities mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the reconnaissance activities like fetching network adapter info and OS product name from the registry.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred after the execution of the Rising Sun implant payload and before the reconnaissance activities.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
