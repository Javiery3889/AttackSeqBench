### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the netd component of Infamous Chisel exfiltrated files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - The key action here is the exfiltration of files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the use of a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:**
     - This technique involves hiding files and directories to avoid detection, which is a common tactic used during the exfiltration process to maintain stealth.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or accounts. This is typically a tactic used earlier in the attack lifecycle, before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment. This is also typically a tactic used earlier in the attack lifecycle, before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing and transferring data out of the target environment. This aligns perfectly with the described action of exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - Impact involves degrading or disrupting the availability or integrity of systems and data. This is typically a tactic used after exfiltration, often to cover tracks or cause further damage.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question describes the exfiltration of files, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence would be the **Exfiltration** tactic itself, as it directly aligns with the described action.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
