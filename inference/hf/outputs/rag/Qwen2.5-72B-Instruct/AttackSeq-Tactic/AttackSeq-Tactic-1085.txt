### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver the ZeroT downloader and establish initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence is to enable ZeroT to communicate with its C2 server via HTTP POST beacons.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with links to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. It does not fit the context of establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers. While it is a necessary step, it does not directly describe the communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which has already been established in the question through spear-phishing.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the methods and protocols used to communicate with compromised systems. Enabling ZeroT to communicate with its C2 server via HTTP POST beacons falls under this tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that after establishing initial access, the next step is to establish command and control communication.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
