### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the lightSpy modular backdoor is executed to enable spying and full control over an iOS device.
   - It then mentions that attackers silently patched Safari and exploited CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories):** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.
   - **Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript):** This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. While this is a crucial part of the attack, the question specifically mentions maintaining control and evading detection, which are more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While the initial execution of the lightSpy backdoor is part of the attack, the question focuses on the actions taken to maintain control and evade detection, which are more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and maintain control. The question mentions silently patching Safari and exploiting CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and evade detection, which directly aligns with the defense evasion tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. While this could be part of a broader attack, the question specifically focuses on maintaining control and evading detection, which are more aligned with defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack described in the question is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
