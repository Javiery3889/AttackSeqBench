### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes like `msiexec.exe` and `rundll32.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This indicates that the primary technique used by Dexphot is process hollowing, which is a method to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This suggests that process hollowing can also be used for privilege escalation, which involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. While process hollowing can be used to maintain persistence, it is not the immediate next step after loading executables into legitimate processes.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to additional systems or accounts. While this is a common next step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the immediate aftermath of process hollowing.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system. While reconnaissance is important, it is typically done before or during the initial stages of an attack, not immediately after process hollowing.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. After process hollowing, the next logical step is to execute the injected code to carry out the attacker's objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible next step after process hollowing is the execution of the injected code.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
