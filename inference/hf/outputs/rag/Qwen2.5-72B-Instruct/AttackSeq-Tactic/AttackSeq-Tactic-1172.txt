### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Lazarus group used backdoor malware packed with Themida to execute remote commands and before they deployed Hermes ransomware to disrupt the FEIB's operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to execute at a specific time, which is a method for maintaining persistence or executing commands.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This technique involves developing or acquiring malware, which is relevant to the initial use of backdoor malware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing**: This technique involves using software packers to obfuscate malware, which is relevant to the use of Themida to pack the backdoor malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. While this is a crucial step in the attack, the question specifies that the backdoor malware has already been used to execute remote commands, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The use of Themida to pack the backdoor malware is a defense evasion technique, but the question asks about what happens after the backdoor is executed and before the ransomware is deployed.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**: This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. Deploying Hermes ransomware to disrupt operations is an impact technique, but the question asks about what happens before this.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system. Scheduling tasks (T1053.002-At) is a persistence technique and fits well between the execution of remote commands and the deployment of ransomware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the Lazarus group used persistence techniques to maintain access to the system after executing remote commands and before deploying the ransomware.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
