### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial payload was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
   - The initial payload delivery is described as an RTF file exploiting specific vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment that, when opened, delivers the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (D):** The initial access is already described in the question as the delivery of the payload via an RTF file. This is covered by the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
   - **Execution (B):** After the initial access, the next logical step is the execution of the payload. The T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and T1204.002-Malicious File techniques both fall under the Execution tactic, indicating that the payload is being executed after it is delivered.
   - **Credential Access (A):** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials, which typically occurs after the initial access and execution of the payload.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system, which is a step that usually follows after the initial access and execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after the initial payload delivery is the execution of the payload.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
