### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before APT10 achieved persistence using scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - The context involves the deployment of malware such as PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the actual attack but is not directly related to achieving persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it can occur before persistence, it is not the most likely immediate precursor to persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. This is a crucial step before achieving persistence, as the malware needs to be executed to set up scheduled tasks or services.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial entry into the victim's network. While it is a necessary step, it typically occurs before the execution of the malware.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in a typical attack would be:
     1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains entry into the network.
     2. **Execution**: The attacker runs the malware (e.g., PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT) on the victim's system.
     3. **Persistence**: The attacker sets up scheduled tasks or Windows services to maintain access.

   - Given this sequence, the most likely tactic that occurred immediately before achieving persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
