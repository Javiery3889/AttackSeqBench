### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where BlueDelta exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to execute scripts that redirected incoming emails and impersonated victims to authenticate to other services.
   - The key actions are:
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube (Initial Access).
     - Executing scripts to redirect incoming emails (Collection).
     - Impersonating victims to authenticate to other services (Credential Access).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the initial exploitation of Roundcube.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves developing resources by compromising email accounts, which is relevant to the impersonation of victims.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to collect emails, which aligns with the redirection of incoming emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:**
     - This is the initial step where the vulnerability in Roundcube is exploited. However, the question asks what happened **after** this initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:**
     - This involves obtaining credentials, which is relevant to the impersonation of victims to authenticate to other services. This is a plausible next step after initial access and collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection:**
     - This involves collecting data, which is relevant to the redirection of incoming emails. This is a plausible step after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion:**
     - This involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described, the most plausible next step after initial access and collection is **Credential Access**. The impersonation of victims to authenticate to other services is a clear indication of credential access.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
