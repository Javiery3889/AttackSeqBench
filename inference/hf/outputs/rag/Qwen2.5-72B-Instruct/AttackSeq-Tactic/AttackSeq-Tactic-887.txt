### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT10 used Mimikatz for credential theft and before they logged in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to bypass security measures.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves maintaining access to a network by using external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It is not directly related to the sequence of using stolen credentials and logging into a network.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the sequence of using stolen credentials and logging into a network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to access additional systems. This could be a plausible step after obtaining valid credentials and before logging into a network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining valid credentials. Since the question states that Mimikatz was used for credential theft, this step has already occurred and is not the next step in the sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after APT10 obtained valid credentials using Mimikatz, they would use those credentials to move laterally within the network. This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique, which is used for both defense evasion and initial access. The next logical step would be to use these valid accounts to log into the network via Citrix servers.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
