### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where APT28 (a known threat actor) uses malware like GAMEFISH through spear-phishing emails to gain initial access to a target system.
   - After gaining initial access, APT28 moves laterally by exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the target network. While APT28 might exfiltrate data, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While credential access is a common step in many attack sequences, the question does not explicitly mention credential access before lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to expand the attacker's control. The question states that APT28 moved laterally by exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that APT28 used initial access techniques (spear-phishing) to gain a foothold and then moved laterally using known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
