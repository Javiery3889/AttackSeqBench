### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor EVILNUM.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by adding a registry key to evade detection.
     - Communicating with the C2 server using a GET request to check.php for one-way communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:**
     - This technique involves the use of one-way communication to send data to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This does not align with the described actions of ensuring persistence and communicating with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim's system. This also does not align with the described actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. The described action of communicating with the C2 server using a GET request to check.php for one-way communication aligns with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the victim's system. The described actions of ensuring persistence and communicating with the C2 server occur after initial access has been established.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
