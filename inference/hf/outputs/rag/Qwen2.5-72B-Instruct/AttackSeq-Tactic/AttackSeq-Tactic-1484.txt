### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the BlackEnergy 3 malware:
     - It gathered local network information using the `GetAdaptersInfo()` function API.
     - It then sent data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, which aligns with the use of `GetAdaptersInfo()`.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could be the next step after discovering the network configuration.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:**
     - This technique involves destroying data, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the sequence of gathering network information and sending data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands and exfiltrate data. This is a plausible next step after gathering network information and before sending data to servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to access other systems. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after gathering network information and before sending data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. It is not relevant to the sequence described, as the malware is already on the system and gathering information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gathering network information and before sending data to servers is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
