### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.
   - Key points:
     - FTP and WebDav servers were used for malware updates.
     - Communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using file transfer protocols (FTP, WebDav) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of a network.
     - While the related TTPs mention exfiltration over unencrypted protocols, the question specifically focuses on the use of FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET for malware updates and communication, which are more aligned with C2 activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system.
     - The question does not mention any activities related to gaining higher privileges.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:**
     - Resource development involves establishing and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack.
     - The question does not mention any activities related to setting up or maintaining infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:**
     - Command and control (C2) involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system.
     - The related TTPs clearly indicate the use of web protocols (HTTP GET) and file transfer protocols (FTP, WebDav) for C2 communication, which aligns with the activities described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
