### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Mustang Panda used the double extension trick and delivered PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade security defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**
     - This technique involves naming malicious files to match legitimate ones to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension**
     - This technique involves using a double file extension (e.g., `file.txt.exe`) to trick users into opening malicious files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it typically follows initial access and defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the compromised system. While persistence is important, it usually follows initial access and defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system. The double extension trick and payload delivery are part of the initial access phase, but the question asks about what happens after these actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The related TTPs (T1036.005, T1574.002, T1036.007) all fall under the Defense Evasion tactic. The double extension trick and payload delivery are part of defense evasion, and the question asks about what happens after these actions, which is likely to be further defense evasion techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question asks about what happens after the double extension trick and payload delivery, and the related TTPs are all under the Defense Evasion tactic, the most plausible answer is that further defense evasion techniques were used.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
