### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already employed techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attacker used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already performed credential access using the technique T1003.001 (LSASS Memory).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. While this is a crucial part of the attack, it typically occurs after initial access and is not directly related to gathering information on network and host configurations.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the network and host configurations. This aligns well with the use of native OS binaries and custom malware to gather such information.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information before the initial compromise. While it is important, it typically occurs before the attacker has access to the system and is not directly related to the use of native OS binaries and custom malware.
   - **Credential Access:** This tactic involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials. The question already states that the attacker has performed credential access (LSASS memory dumping and credential harvesting), so this tactic has already occurred.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the attacker used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
