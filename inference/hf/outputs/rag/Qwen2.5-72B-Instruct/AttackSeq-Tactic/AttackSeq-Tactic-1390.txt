### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT10 used tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation and before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network using Windows and open-source pentesting tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain and use credentials to gain access to systems. While APT10 used tools like mimikatz for credential access, this tactic is more likely to occur before the reconnaissance and propagation phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after initial access and reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques to move through a network from one system to another. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access and credentials, and before conducting detailed internal reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is an important tactic, it is not the most likely next step after reconnaissance and propagation and before internal reconnaissance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after using tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation and before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
