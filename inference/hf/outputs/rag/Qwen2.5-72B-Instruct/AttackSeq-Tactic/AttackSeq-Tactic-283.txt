### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after cybercriminals used leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering.
   - The key phrase here is "after cybercriminals leveraged leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.002-Search Engines:** This technique involves using search engines to gather information, which aligns with the use of SheYun for intelligence gathering.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1597-Search Closed Sources:** This technique involves searching closed or restricted sources for information, which is also a form of reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt or damage the target's operations. While financial theft (T1657) is a form of impact, it is not the immediate next step after reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the target. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves building and maintaining resources to support the attack. This is not directly related to the immediate next step after reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. The use of SheYun for intelligence gathering is a form of reconnaissance, and the next step in the attack lifecycle is often to continue or expand reconnaissance efforts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that after using SheYun for initial intelligence gathering, the cybercriminals would likely continue their reconnaissance efforts to gather more information.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
