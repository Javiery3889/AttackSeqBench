### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the SBDH malware contacted a remote server to download its backdoor and data stealer components for gaining remote control and advanced data exfiltration capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data in a remote location before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data to a remote location.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malware on the victim's system. This is a necessary step before the malware can perform any other actions, but it does not directly relate to the sequence of contacting a remote server to download components.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing a communication channel with a remote server to receive commands and exfiltrate data. This is a critical step before the malware can download additional components.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through the network to other systems. This is not directly related to the initial contact with a remote server to download components.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold on the victim's system. This is a necessary step before any other actions, but it does not directly relate to the sequence of contacting a remote server to download components.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware first establishes a command and control (C2) channel to communicate with the remote server. Once the C2 channel is established, the malware can then download its backdoor and data stealer components.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
