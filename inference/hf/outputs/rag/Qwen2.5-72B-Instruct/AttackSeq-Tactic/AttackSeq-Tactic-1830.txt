### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments were used to gain entry into the target systems.
   - The spear-phishing emails exploited CVE-2017-0199, which is a known vulnerability.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client) to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):**
     - This tactic is already part of the initial attack vector (spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments). The question is asking about what happens after this initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. While this is a common next step, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Persistence (C):**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While this is also a common next step, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Execution (D):**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. Given that the spear-phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that exploited CVE-2017-0199, the next logical step would be the execution of the malicious code to gain control of the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails is the execution of the malicious code.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
