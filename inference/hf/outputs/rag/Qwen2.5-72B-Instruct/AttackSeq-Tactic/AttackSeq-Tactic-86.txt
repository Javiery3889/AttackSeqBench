### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Agrius gained initial access by exploiting a public-facing application and then achieved persistence by registering a backdoor as a service.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved using the technique T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application).
   - This confirms that the initial access has already been established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. It is a common next step after gaining initial access, as the attacker needs to execute their payload to further their objectives.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. The question states that persistence was achieved by registering a backdoor as a service, which is a later step in the attack sequence.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target system, such as network topology, user accounts, and system configurations. This is often a step taken after gaining initial access and before establishing persistence.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic has already been completed by exploiting the public-facing application, so it cannot be the answer.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sequence of events, the most logical step between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is to execute the necessary code to set up the backdoor.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: A: Execution
