### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Trickbot has already gathered credentials and application information.
   - It then uses specific modules (psfin32 and shadnewdll) for Point of Sale (PoS) data extraction and modification of web traffic.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that follows these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:** This technique involves stealing web session cookies, which can be used to maintain access to web applications.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files:** This technique involves stealing credentials from files on the system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the system. While Trickbot has already gathered credentials and application information, the use of psfin32 and shadnewdll for PoS data extraction and web traffic modification suggests that the primary focus is on data exfiltration and manipulation, which aligns more with the Collection tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question does not indicate any actions related to establishing or maintaining command and control.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question states that Trickbot has already gathered credentials, so this tactic is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. The question does not indicate any actions related to discovery after the initial credential gathering and data extraction.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after Trickbot has gathered credentials and application information and used specific modules for PoS data extraction and web traffic modification is the **Collection** of the data.

**Final Answer: A: Collection**
