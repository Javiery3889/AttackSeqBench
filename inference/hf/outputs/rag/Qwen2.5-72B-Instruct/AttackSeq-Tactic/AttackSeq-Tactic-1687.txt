### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the adversary used discovery tactics (specifically, using PsLogList to export Security Event logs) and before the collection of data from various sources (SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves the adversary using tools like PsLogList to gather information from logs.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.008-Clear Mailbox Data:** This technique involves the adversary clearing mailbox data to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering account information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain access to the network. It is unlikely to occur after discovery and before data collection.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the network over time. While it can occur after discovery, it is not typically a direct precursor to data collection.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the network, systems, and users. The question already mentions that discovery tactics have been used (e.g., using PsLogList to export Security Event logs). Therefore, this is not the most plausible next step.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems and resources. After discovering the network and before collecting data, lateral movement is a logical next step to gain access to the necessary systems and data sources.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after discovery and before data collection is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
