### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has already captured credentials, enabled remote access, and is now focusing on gathering credit card data.
   - The specific method of gathering credit card data involves monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files, documents, and other data stored on the system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves monitoring the clipboard to capture data that users copy and paste, which could include sensitive information like credit card details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, such as network topology, user accounts, and system configurations. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it does not align with the specific action of gathering credit card data by monitoring the clipboard and printer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While enabling remote access is a form of persistence, the question is asking about the next step after remote access has been established, which is not persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. The related TTPs T1005 and T1115 both fall under the Collection tactic and directly align with the described actions of monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to the target system. The question states that credentials have already been captured, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the Collection tactic, specifically the techniques T1005 and T1115.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
