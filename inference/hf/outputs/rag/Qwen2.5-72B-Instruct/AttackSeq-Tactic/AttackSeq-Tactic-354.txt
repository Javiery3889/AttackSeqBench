### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the use of encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute a custom VM-based payload and before the use of tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves the use of tools to discover network services, which aligns with the use of pscan and nmap.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which aligns with the use of encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is possible that defense evasion techniques were used, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events, and defense evasion is not directly related to the use of network service scanning tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system. While persistence might be a goal, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the environment. The use of pscan and nmap for network service scanning falls under the Discovery tactic, specifically T1046-Network Service Discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to access other systems. While lateral movement might occur after discovery, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before network service scanning.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred after the execution of the custom VM-based payload using encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts and before the use of pscan and nmap for network service scanning.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
