### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before BlackSoul communicated with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol to execute commands and upload gathered files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the communication with the C2 server is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic, specifically using web protocols.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This indicates that the exfiltration of data (uploading gathered files) is part of the Exfiltration tactic, and it occurs over the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code or commands on the victim's system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs before the C2 communication is established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The communication with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. While this can occur after initial C2 communication, it is not a prerequisite for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While this can occur before C2 communication, it is not a necessary step for establishing C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred before BlackSoul communicated with the C2 server is **Command and Control**. The communication with the C2 server is a key part of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
