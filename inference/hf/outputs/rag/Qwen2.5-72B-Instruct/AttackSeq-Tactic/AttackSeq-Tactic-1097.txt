### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely preceded the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document to create a malware dropper named exp1ore.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a spear phishing email with a link that, when clicked, leads to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spear phishing email with an attachment that, when opened, leads to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources necessary for an attack, such as creating malicious documents or setting up infrastructure. While this is a necessary step, it does not directly precede the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it does not directly precede the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target system. The related TTPs T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) and T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) both fall under the Initial Access tactic. These techniques are directly related to the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not precede the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Initial Access tactic, specifically the use of spear phishing techniques, preceded the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
