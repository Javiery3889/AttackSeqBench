### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about an ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred after persistence was established with C2 beaconing but was verified by the internal security team as not having taken place.
   - Key points:
     - Persistence was established.
     - C2 beaconing was used.
     - The internal security team verified that a certain tactic did not occur.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate network protocols to mask malicious traffic.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This could occur after persistence and C2 beaconing, but it is not typically verified as not having taken place by the security team.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Since C2 beaconing is already mentioned as part of the persistence, this tactic is already in place and cannot be the one that did not occur.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim's network and systems. This could occur after persistence and C2 beaconing, but it is not typically verified as not having taken place by the security team.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network. This is a logical next step after establishing persistence and C2 beaconing. If the security team verified that this did not occur, it fits the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the internal security team verified that **Lateral Movement** did not occur after persistence and C2 beaconing were established.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
