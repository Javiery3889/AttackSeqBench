### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before APT42 gained initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting techniques.
   - The context is that APT42 has already conducted reconnaissance and social engineering efforts to gather information on targets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using spear phishing to gather information about the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to the target's systems.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information about the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network and understand the environment after gaining access. It is not relevant to the pre-access phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target's systems after gaining access. It is not relevant to the pre-access phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. The related TTPs (T1598.001 and T1598) clearly indicate that reconnaissance activities, including spear phishing and phishing for information, are part of the pre-access phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. While it is a pre-attack phase, it is not directly related to the specific activities described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the reconnaissance phase, involving spear phishing and phishing for information, occurred before the initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
