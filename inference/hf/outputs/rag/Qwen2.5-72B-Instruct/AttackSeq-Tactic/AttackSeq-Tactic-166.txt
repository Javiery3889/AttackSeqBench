### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to avoid detection after installing backdoors and before connecting to command and control servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. This is a strong candidate because avoiding detection is a crucial step before establishing command and control.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. While this is important, it typically occurs earlier in the attack sequence, such as during the initial compromise.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to access additional systems. This is not directly related to avoiding detection before command and control.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target system. This is typically done after establishing command and control, not before.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the need to avoid detection before establishing command and control, the most plausible answer is **A: Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
