### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for communication with a command and control domain as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves transferring data from the victim's network to an external location at scheduled intervals.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a command and control server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from various sources. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to the communication with a command and control domain.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or compromise data integrity. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and is not directly related to the communication with a command and control domain.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with a command and control server to receive instructions and exfiltrate data. The related TTP T1071.004-DNS directly supports this choice, as it describes using DNS requests for command and control communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. While this could occur after initial communication with a command and control server, it is not the most immediate next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for communication with a command and control domain, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
