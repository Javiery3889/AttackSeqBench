### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: reconnaissance through the SocGholish framework on compromised websites, followed by executing commands via PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**
   - These TTPs indicate that the use of PowerShell for command execution is a key part of the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. While reconnaissance is part of the initial stages, the question already mentions that reconnaissance has been conducted. Therefore, this is less likely to be the correct answer.
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While this could be a step in the attack, the question does not mention any specific credential harvesting activities between reconnaissance and command execution.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system. While collection can occur at various stages, it is not typically a prerequisite for executing commands via PowerShell.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running malicious commands or scripts on a system. The related TTPs clearly indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute commands, which aligns with the Execution tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Execution tactic occurred between the reconnaissance and the deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon via PowerShell.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
