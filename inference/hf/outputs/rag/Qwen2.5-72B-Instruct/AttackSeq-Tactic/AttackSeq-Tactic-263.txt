### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers used Defense Evasion techniques (specifically Indicator Removal on Host) and before they employed Discovery techniques (specifically Process Discovery).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Defense Evasion tactic and the specific technique T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal on Host):** This technique is used to remove or alter forensic evidence on a host to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery (Process Discovery):** This technique involves the attackers gathering information about the internal network and processes to understand the environment better.

   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This is the tactic that involves gathering information about the environment. However, the question specifies that Discovery techniques (like Process Discovery) occur after the Defense Evasion techniques. Therefore, Discovery cannot be the answer.

   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves techniques that allow the attackers to maintain access to the system over time. It is a logical step after evading defenses but before discovering the network, as the attackers might want to ensure they can return to the system.

   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the system. While it is a common step in an attack, it typically occurs earlier in the attack chain, often before Defense Evasion.

   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials to access systems. It is a logical step after evading defenses and before discovering the network, as the attackers might need additional credentials to move laterally and gather more information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after Defense Evasion and before Discovery is **Credential Access**. This is because the attackers would likely need additional credentials to move laterally and gather more information about the internal network.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
