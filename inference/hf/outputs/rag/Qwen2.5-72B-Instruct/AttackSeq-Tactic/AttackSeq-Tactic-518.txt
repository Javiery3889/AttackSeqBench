### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
   - The next step in the sequence involves establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This choice aligns well with the described sequence. After gathering system and network information, the next logical step is to establish communication with the C2 server, which is exactly what the T1071.001 technique describes.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up servers or domains. It does not fit the sequence of establishing communication with C2 servers after reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which has already been done in the initial reconnaissance phase. It does not fit the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the target system. While it is a common next step after initial access, it does not fit the specific sequence of establishing communication with C2 servers using HTTP POST requests.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant establishes communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests, which falls under the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
