### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where ScarCruft used phishing emails containing Office documents with macros to compromise host systems and load further malicious scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** The spearphishing emails with attachments are used to gain initial access to the system. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Execution (C):** Once the user opens the malicious Office document, the macro executes the malicious script. This is the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement (A):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. This would typically occur after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker's infrastructure. This would typically occur after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Initial Access** (spearphishing emails with attachments)
     2. **Execution** (opening the malicious Office document and running the macro)
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the initial compromise and loading of the malicious script. Given the sequence, the next logical step would be **Command and Control** to establish communication with the attacker's infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
