### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the exfiltration of harvested documents to the C&C server and after the malware used both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the malware used web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This indicates that the harvested documents were exfiltrated over the C2 (Command and Control) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - This is the tactic that occurs after the malware has established communication with the C&C server and is ready to send the harvested documents. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. This is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server or the exfiltration of documents.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The related TTP (T1071.001-Web Protocols) indicates that the malware used HTTP and HTTPS to communicate with the C&C server. This communication must occur before the exfiltration of documents.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to the system over time. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server or the exfiltration of documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the exfiltration of harvested documents to the C&C server and after the malware used both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
