### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Roaming Tiger gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - After gaining initial access, they ensured persistence by writing registry keys to run malicious files on startup.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique is used to gain initial access to a system by sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. It is typically performed after gaining access and establishing persistence, not immediately after initial access.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. After gaining initial access through a spear-phishing email, the next logical step is to execute the malicious payload.
   - **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system over time. The question states that persistence was ensured by writing registry keys, which is a persistence technique.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It is typically performed before or after gaining initial access, but not necessarily immediately after.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access** (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment): The attacker gains access through a spear-phishing email.
     2. **Execution**: The malicious payload in the attachment is executed on the victim's system.
     3. **Persistence**: The attacker ensures persistence by writing registry keys to run malicious files on startup.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
