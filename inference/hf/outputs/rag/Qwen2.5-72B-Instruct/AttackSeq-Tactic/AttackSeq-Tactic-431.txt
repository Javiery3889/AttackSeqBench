### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers initially gained access to hosts using tools like Advanced IP Scanner and xDedic RDP Patch.
   - After gaining access, they extracted password hashes, which is a form of credential access.
   - The next step involved using batch files (AutoExe1.bat) to delete traces of their activity and maintain access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials:** This technique involves extracting cached domain credentials, which aligns with the extraction of password hashes.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attacker's activity, which aligns with the use of batch files to delete traces.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in the network, which has already been described as using tools like Advanced IP Scanner and xDedic RDP Patch. This does not fit the next step of deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which includes deleting files to remove traces of the attacker's activity. This aligns with the use of batch files to delete traces.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which is not relevant to the described action of deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not directly related to the described action of deleting traces.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
