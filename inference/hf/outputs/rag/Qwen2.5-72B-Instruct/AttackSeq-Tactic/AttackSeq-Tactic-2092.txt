### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the MSIL/Crimson downloader has successfully downloaded a full Remote Access Tool (RAT) from a specified host.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves the RAT communicating with its servers using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for C2, such as custom TCP protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence is a crucial part of many attack sequences, it is not the immediate next step after downloading and executing a RAT.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While exfiltration is a common goal, it typically follows after establishing command and control.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. Given that the RAT is using a custom TCP protocol to communicate with its servers, this is the most relevant tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The execution of the RAT has already occurred, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step is establishing command and control using the custom TCP protocol.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
