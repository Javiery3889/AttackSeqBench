### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the UNC1945 group.
   - They collected credentials using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz.
   - They then moved laterally through networks using tools like ProxyChains and IMPACKET.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate and move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
     - This technique is also listed under Defense Evasion, indicating that it can be used to evade detection while moving laterally.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the context of collecting credentials and moving laterally.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. This is typically done before the initial compromise and does not fit the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as using Mimikatz to extract credentials. This fits the context of the question, as the group has already collected credentials using SLAPSTICK and Mimikatz.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques to gather information about the target network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This could be a plausible step after collecting credentials but before moving laterally.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after collecting credentials, the attackers would need to discover the network and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between collecting credentials and moving laterally is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
