### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer during Operation Aurora.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Internet Explorer) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves placing malicious code on a website that the victim visits, leading to the execution of the code on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It is typically used after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the tactic that occurred before the exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While the exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability is part of the execution phase, the question is asking about what happened before this exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on a victim's system. The technique T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) is a common method for initial access, where the attackers place malicious code on a website that the victim visits. This aligns well with the context of Operation Aurora, where the attackers used a drive-by compromise to exploit the zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. While this can be a part of the attack sequence, it typically occurs after initial access has been gained.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first gained initial access through a drive-by compromise, which then led to the exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
