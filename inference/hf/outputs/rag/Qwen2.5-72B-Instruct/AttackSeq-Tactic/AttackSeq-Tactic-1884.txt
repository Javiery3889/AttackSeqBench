### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Shellbot gathers information about the infected host's processor details and monitoring tools.
   - The next step involves maintaining communication through an IRC channel to send commands and execute malicious activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This indicates that the initial step of gathering information about the host's system is part of the Discovery tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. This is not directly related to maintaining communication through an IRC channel.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it does not specifically describe maintaining communication through an IRC channel.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system, which has already been described in the question. This is not the next step.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves maintaining communication with the infected host to send commands and receive data. This aligns perfectly with the described next step of maintaining communication through an IRC channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the Discovery phase, the next step is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
