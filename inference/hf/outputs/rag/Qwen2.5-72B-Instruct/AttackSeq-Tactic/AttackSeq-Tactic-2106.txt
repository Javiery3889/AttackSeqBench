### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that enabled the attackers to compromise Avast's download servers and embed the malicious binary in software accessed by users.
   - The focus is on the initial step that allowed the attackers to gain access to the servers and modify the software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary:**
     - This technique involves modifying a legitimate binary to include malicious code, which is relevant to the embedding of the malicious binary.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:**
     - This technique involves embedding malicious payloads within legitimate files, which is also relevant to the embedding of the malicious binary.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - C2 is about establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. This is not the initial step of gaining access to the servers.
   - **B: Execution:**
     - Execution is about running the malicious code. This is a step that occurs after the binary has been embedded and downloaded by users.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. This is not the initial step of gaining access to the servers.
   - **D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access is about gaining the initial foothold in the target environment. This is the most likely tactic that enabled the attackers to compromise Avast's download servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers first gained initial access to Avast's download servers, which allowed them to embed the malicious binary in the software.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
