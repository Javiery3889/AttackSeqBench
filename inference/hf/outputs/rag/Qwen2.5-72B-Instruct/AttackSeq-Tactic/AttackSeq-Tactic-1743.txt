### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have used steganography to hide Command and Control (C&C) data in PDF or JPG files.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to transfer stolen data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves using steganography to hide C&C data.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography:** This technique involves using steganography to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It is not relevant to the transfer of stolen data.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While steganography can be used for defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the transfer of stolen data, which is a different phase of the attack.
   - **Exfiltration (C):** This tactic involves techniques to steal and transfer data from the victim's network to the attacker's control. This is the most relevant tactic for the transfer of stolen data.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with compromised systems. While steganography can be used for C&C, the question is about the transfer of stolen data, which is a different phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question, is that after using steganography for C&C, the attackers would use the Exfiltration tactic to transfer the stolen data.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
