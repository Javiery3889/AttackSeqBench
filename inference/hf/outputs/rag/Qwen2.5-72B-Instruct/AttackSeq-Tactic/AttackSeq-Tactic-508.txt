### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear phishing attack that uses a malicious Excel file to deliver a payload.
   - The target is the Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial spear phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.002-Email Addresses):** This technique involves gathering email addresses of potential targets, which is a pre-attack activity.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This technique involves using spear phishing with an attachment (in this case, a malicious Excel file) to gain initial access to the target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.002-Email Addresses):** This is a pre-attack activity and would have occurred before the spear phishing attack.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This is the initial attack vector used to deliver the payload, which is the spear phishing attack itself.
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is typically a pre-attack activity.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the target system over time. It would likely occur after the initial access has been gained.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target system and network. It would likely occur after the initial access has been gained.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code on the target system. It would likely occur after the initial access has been gained, as the payload is delivered and executed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to occur after the initial spear phishing attack (Initial Access) is **Execution**. The payload delivered by the spear phishing attack would need to be executed to carry out the intended malicious activity.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
