### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and compromise additional endpoints.
   - The focus is on the tactic that most likely preceded the lateral movement efforts to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or gathering information. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not directly precede lateral movement.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it is important during an attack, it is not the most likely immediate precursor to lateral movement.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which are often necessary for lateral movement. However, the question implies that the attacker has already compromised additional endpoints, suggesting that credential access has already occurred.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network, systems, and users. Mapping the internal network and identifying potential targets is a crucial step before lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the attacker has used Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and compromise additional endpoints, the most likely tactic that preceded the lateral movement efforts is **Discovery**. This is because the attacker needed to gather information about the network and identify potential targets before moving laterally.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
