### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers gained system information (network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings) but before executing the TDrop2 malware using a process hollowing technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about network connections, which aligns with the system information mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique involves executing malware by injecting code into a legitimate process, which is the final step mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about running processes, which is also part of the system information mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which typically occurs before any discovery or execution of malware. Therefore, it is not a plausible answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems, which is not directly related to the sequence of gaining system information and then executing malware. Therefore, it is not a plausible answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which typically occurs after the initial access and discovery phases. However, it is not a necessary step between gaining system information and executing malware. Therefore, it is not the most plausible answer.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. However, the question specifically mentions that the attackers have already gained system information, which is part of the Discovery tactic. Therefore, Reconnaissance is not the most accurate answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible answer is **D: Reconnaissance**. However, given the context and the related TTPs, the correct answer should be **D: Reconnaissance** but with the understanding that the Discovery phase is already part of the sequence. The question is asking for the next logical step after Discovery and before Defense Evasion, which is not explicitly listed in the choices. However, the closest and most logical answer based on the given choices is **D: Reconnaissance**.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
