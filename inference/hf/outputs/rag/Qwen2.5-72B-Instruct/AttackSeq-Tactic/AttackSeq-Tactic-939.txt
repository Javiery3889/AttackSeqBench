### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Tropic Trooper after gaining initial access.
   - The sequence includes exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office Equation Editor, downloading an installer package, and then using BITSadmin to create a job and launch a malicious file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office Equation Editor) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download or execute files in a way that evades detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before gaining initial access, not after.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence techniques might be used after gaining initial access, the question specifically asks about the action before creating a BITSadmin job.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. The related TTPs T1203 and T1204.002 both fall under the Execution tactic, indicating that the initial exploitation and downloading of the installer package are part of the Execution phase.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it typically follows the initial execution of the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the **Execution** tactic occurred before the backdoor installer created a BITSadmin job and launched the normal sidebar.exe file to execute malicious actions.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
