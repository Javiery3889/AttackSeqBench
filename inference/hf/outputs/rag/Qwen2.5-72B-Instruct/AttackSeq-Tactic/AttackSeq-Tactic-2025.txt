### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a Cobalt Strike attack.
   - The attacker configured Listeners in Cobalt Strike to determine how infected hosts would communicate with the C2 server.
   - The C2 server then responded with a "beacon.dll".

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves setting up scheduled data transfers, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for command and control communication, which is highly relevant to the communication between the infected host and the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using rundll32 to execute code, which is not directly relevant to the communication setup described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code, which is not the focus of the question. The question is about communication setup, not the initial execution of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**: This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service, which is not relevant to the communication setup.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which is not the focus of the question. The question assumes that the system is already infected and is setting up communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the infected system. The configuration of Listeners and the response with "beacon.dll" are both part of the command and control process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
