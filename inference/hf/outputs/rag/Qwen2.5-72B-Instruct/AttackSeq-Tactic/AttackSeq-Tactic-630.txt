### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG-3279.
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance through open source research and network scanning.
   - The sequence ends with the establishment of persistence using optionally loaded DLLs for the Conpee plugin framework.
   - We need to determine which MITRE ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1593 - Search Open Websites/Domains):** This technique involves gathering information from publicly available sources.
   - **Persistence (T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This typically occurs after initial access and before or during the establishment of persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed to support an attack. This is often a preparatory step that occurs before reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to a network or system. This typically occurs after reconnaissance and before establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the final step in the sequence described in the question, so it cannot be the answer.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step between reconnaissance and persistence is **Initial Access**. After gathering information through reconnaissance, the threat group would need to gain initial access to the target system before establishing persistence.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
