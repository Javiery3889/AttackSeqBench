### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the RIG EK gained initial access through malvertising and redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising:** This technique involves the use of malvertising to gain access to resources or to set up the initial conditions for an attack.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves the use of drive-by compromises, where users are redirected to malicious sites that exploit vulnerabilities in their browsers or other software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gather and prepare the resources needed for the attack. Malvertising (T1583.008) is a technique under Resource Development, which involves setting up the infrastructure to deliver the exploit kit.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's initial entry into the victim's network. Drive-by Compromise (T1189) is a technique under Initial Access, which involves the actual exploitation of the user's browser to gain access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to steal data from the victim's network. This is not relevant to the initial stages of the attack described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is not relevant to the initial stages of the attack described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the adversary first engaged in **Resource Development** by setting up malvertising campaigns to redirect users to malicious sites. This would then lead to the **Initial Access** through drive-by compromises.

**Final Answer: A: Resource Development**
