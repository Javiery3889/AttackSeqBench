### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already evaded detection through modified network traffic patterns and an encrypted downloader.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to maintain communication with servers such as roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to maintain communication with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious files or programs to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While this is a common tactic, it does not directly relate to maintaining communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the question mentions evasion, the focus is on maintaining communication, which is more aligned with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While important, it does not directly relate to maintaining communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. The related TTP (T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation) directly supports this tactic by describing how the attacker maintains communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of maintaining communication with C2 servers, is the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
