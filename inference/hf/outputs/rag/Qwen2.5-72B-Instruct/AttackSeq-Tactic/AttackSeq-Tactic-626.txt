### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that enabled attackers to maintain communication and control over the compromised infrastructure after establishing persistence and before exfiltrating data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This indicates that the attackers used protocol tunneling to maintain communication and control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This indicates that the data was exfiltrated over the command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It does not fit the context of maintaining communication and control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target network. While it is a crucial step, it does not enable the maintenance of communication and control.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves the methods and techniques used by attackers to communicate with and control the compromised infrastructure. The related TTP (T1572-Protocol Tunneling) directly supports this choice.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It does not fit the context of maintaining communication and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves maintaining communication and control over the compromised infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
