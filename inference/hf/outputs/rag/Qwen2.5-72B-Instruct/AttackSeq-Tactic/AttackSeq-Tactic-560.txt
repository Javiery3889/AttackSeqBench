### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Earth Empusa created a phishing page disguised as a download page to convince users to download a malicious Android video application.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the creation of the phishing page.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users who visit the site.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending targeted emails with malicious links to specific individuals or organizations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not relevant to the initial stages of the attack described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the creation of the phishing page.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The creation of a phishing page and convincing users to download a malicious application are both part of the initial access phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It is not relevant to the initial stages of the attack described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the **Initial Access** tactic occurred after the creation of the phishing page. This is because the phishing page is used to gain initial access to the user's device by convincing them to download the malicious application.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
