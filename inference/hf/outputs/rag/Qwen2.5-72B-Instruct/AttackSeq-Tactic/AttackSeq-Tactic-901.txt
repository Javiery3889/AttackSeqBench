### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used DLL side-loading to launch a malicious payload. The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication and control over the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading**
   - This indicates that the attacker has already used DLL side-loading to evade defenses and execute a malicious payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. While this is a common next step, it is not the most immediate action after evading defenses and launching a payload.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion is already part of the initial attack (DLL side-loading). The question is asking about the next step, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials to access systems. This is not the immediate next step after launching a payload and evading defenses.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves techniques to communicate with and control compromised systems. This is the most logical next step after evading defenses and launching a payload, as the attacker needs to establish a channel to control the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after evading defenses through DLL side-loading, the attacker would establish Command and Control to communicate with and control the compromised system.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
