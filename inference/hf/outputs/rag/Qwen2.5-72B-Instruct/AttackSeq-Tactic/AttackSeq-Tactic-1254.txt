### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The campaign started with reconnaissance activities.
   - The next step was gaining access to the networks by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:**
     - This technique involves gathering credentials as part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (B):**
     - The question already states that reconnaissance activities were conducted using the campaign infrastructure.
     - This is the initial phase of the attack.
   - **Resource Development (C):**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware.
     - It is typically done before reconnaissance.
   - **Collection (D):**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the target network after gaining access.
     - It is a later phase of the attack, not between reconnaissance and initial access.
   - **Initial Access (A):**
     - This tactic involves gaining access to the target network.
     - The question states that the campaign gained access by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services, which aligns with the technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Fox Kitten Campaign conducted reconnaissance, then gained initial access by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred after reconnaissance and before gaining access is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
