### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. Delivering Gh0st RAT via email is an example of Initial Access (T1192 - Spearphishing Attachment). However, this choice does not fit the sequence as it is the initial step, not the step between initial access and DLL side-loading.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the payload (Gh0st RAT). This fits well in the sequence between initial access and DLL side-loading.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversary executed the payload (Gh0st RAT) after gaining initial access via email, and then used DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
