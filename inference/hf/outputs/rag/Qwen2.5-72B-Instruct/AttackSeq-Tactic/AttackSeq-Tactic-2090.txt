### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 were sent to officials at Indian embassies, leading to the dropping of the svchost.exe downloader.
   - The key points are:
     - Weaponized RTF documents were sent.
     - The documents exploited CVE-2012-0158.
     - The exploit led to the dropping of the svchost.exe downloader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a document reader) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution:**
     - This choice aligns with the T1203 technique, which involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code. However, the question is asking about what happened after the weaponized RTF documents were sent and the exploit was successful.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement:**
     - This choice does not fit the sequence described. Lateral movement typically occurs after initial access and execution, not immediately after the initial exploit.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:**
     - This choice aligns with the T1566.001 technique, which involves gaining initial access through spearphishing with a malicious attachment. The weaponized RTF documents were sent to gain initial access, and the exploit (T1203) was used to execute the payload.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:**
     - This choice does not fit the sequence described. Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial access, not after the exploit has been successful.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was gained through the spearphishing attachment, which then led to the execution of the exploit and the dropping of the svchost.exe downloader.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
