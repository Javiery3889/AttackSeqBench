### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware ATMitch.
   - ATMitch disguises its payload as a resource within the loader and uses thread hijacking to avoid detection.
   - After these actions, it reads commands from a file in the 'c:\intel' folder and logs actions into 'c:\intel\__log.txt'.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location, which is a sub-technique under the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - This TTP describes how malware can disguise itself by matching the name or location of legitimate files or processes to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location):** This is the initial stage where ATMitch disguises its payload and uses thread hijacking to avoid detection.
   - **Reading commands from a file and logging actions:** This suggests that the malware is executing commands and logging its actions, which is typically part of the Command and Control (C2) phase.

4. **Determine the Intermediate Tactic:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial defense evasion and before the execution of commands and logging actions.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the malware communicating with the attacker's server to receive commands and send back data. This fits well with the described sequence where the malware reads commands from a file and logs actions.

5. **Evaluate Other Choices:**
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, which typically occurs before the initial infection and is not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the malware gathering information about the system and network, which could occur after initial infection but is not specifically mentioned in the sequence.
   - **Credential Access:** This tactic involves the malware attempting to obtain credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence and is typically a separate phase.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
