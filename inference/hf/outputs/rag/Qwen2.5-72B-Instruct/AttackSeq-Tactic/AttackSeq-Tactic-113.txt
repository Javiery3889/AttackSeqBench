### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Charming Kitten developed phishing sites and before they gained initial access through spear-phishing methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This is a specific type of phishing where the attacker sends a spear-phishing link to the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating malware, or developing phishing sites. Since the question states that the phishing sites have already been developed, this tactic would have occurred before the development of the phishing sites.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This could include identifying potential targets, understanding their online behavior, and finding vulnerabilities. Given that the phishing sites are already developed, it is likely that reconnaissance was conducted to identify the targets and understand their behavior, which would help in creating the phishing sites and spear-phishing links.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system after gaining access. Since the question is about the steps before gaining initial access, this tactic is not relevant.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system after gaining access. Since the question is about the steps before gaining initial access, this tactic is not relevant.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that Charming Kitten conducted **Reconnaissance** to gather information about the targets before developing the phishing sites and using spear-phishing methods to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
