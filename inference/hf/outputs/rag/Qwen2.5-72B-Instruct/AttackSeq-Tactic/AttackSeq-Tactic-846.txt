### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Longhorn's malware:
     - It used commands for remote control.
     - It used customized plugins for Collection.
     - It then protected communications with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) for command and control (C&C) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using asymmetric encryption over a non-C2 (Command and Control) protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems. This does not align with the described action of protecting communications with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS to protect communications with C&C servers aligns well with this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information to plan future attacks. This does not align with the described action of protecting communications with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from a compromised system. While the malware used customized plugins for Collection, the next step described is protecting communications with C&C servers, which is more aligned with Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described, the most plausible next step is to establish and maintain command and control over the compromised system using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
