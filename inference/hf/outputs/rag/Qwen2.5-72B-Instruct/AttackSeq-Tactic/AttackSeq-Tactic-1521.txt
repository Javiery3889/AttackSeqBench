### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Whitefly used stolen credentials to expand their control within the network.
   - The key points are:
     - Whitefly used tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
     - They compromised machines.
     - They then used stolen credentials to expand their control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique involves manipulating network protocols to capture credentials.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:**
     - This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. This is typically done after gaining initial access and is not directly related to the harvesting of credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand control. This is what Whitefly does after they have stolen credentials, not before.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to capture credentials, which aligns with the use of tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials. This is the step that occurs before using stolen credentials to expand control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it is not directly related to the harvesting of credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Whitefly first used techniques under the **Credential Access** tactic to harvest credentials, and then used those credentials to expand their control within the network.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
