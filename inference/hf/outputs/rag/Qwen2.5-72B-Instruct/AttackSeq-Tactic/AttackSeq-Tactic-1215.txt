### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers used commands like `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` for enumeration.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the current user and system owner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, the question specifically mentions enumeration activities, which are more aligned with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to access additional systems. The question mentions executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers, which is a clear indication of Lateral Movement. However, the enumeration activities described (using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer`) are more aligned with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. The related TTPs (T1082 and T1033) are directly related to the enumeration activities described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**: This tactic involves manipulating or disrupting the availability or integrity of systems. The question does not mention any impact activities, so this is not a plausible choice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the Lateral Movement tactic. The enumeration activities (using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer`) are part of the Discovery tactic, and these activities would typically precede the execution of commands and injection of processes on remote computers.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
