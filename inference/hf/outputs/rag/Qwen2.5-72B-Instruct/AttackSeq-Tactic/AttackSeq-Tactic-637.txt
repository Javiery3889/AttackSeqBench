### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations and servers before they achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over compromised systems. It is typically used after initial access has been achieved, not before.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or acquiring tools. While it is a pre-attack activity, it does not specifically inform the strategic targeting of specific systems.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target network. It is typically used after initial access has been achieved, not before.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is crucial for informing the strategic targeting of specific systems, such as ICS control workstations and servers running SCADA software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that GreyEnergy used **Reconnaissance** to gather information about the target's ICS control workstations and servers before achieving initial access through spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
