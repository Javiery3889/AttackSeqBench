### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have been persistently collecting credentials and preparing them for transmission every hour.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is the establishment of a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) to communicate with a command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up servers or domains. It does not fit the context of uploading stolen credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While the question mentions collecting credentials, the focus is on the next step of uploading them, not the collection itself.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to support future attacks. The question is about the current step of uploading credentials, not gathering information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The use of FTP to upload stolen credentials aligns with the Command and Control tactic, specifically the technique T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the establishment of a mechanism to upload stolen credentials to an external FTP server, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
