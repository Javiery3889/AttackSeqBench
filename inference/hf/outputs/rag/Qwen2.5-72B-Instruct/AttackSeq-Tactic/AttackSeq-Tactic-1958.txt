### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication to evade detection and sends checksum-validated VictimSystemData in HTTP headers.
   - The final step in the sequence is establishing contact with the C2 (Command and Control) server via initial HTTP GET requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Command and Control** and the technique is **T1071.001 - Web Protocols**.
   - This technique involves using standard web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (A):** While the use of the WinInet API and checksum-validated data might be part of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the action of establishing contact with the C2 server, which is more aligned with command and control.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** Lateral movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Command and Control (C):** Establishing contact with a C2 server via HTTP GET requests is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic. The related TTPs also support this.
   - **Collection (D):** Collection involves gathering data from the victim system, which is not the focus of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
