### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Darkhotel APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors (Defense Evasion).
     - Encrypting gathered data in log files (Defense Evasion).
     - Targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the part of the question about targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to sign backdoors, which aligns with the part of the question about evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves encrypting or encoding files, which aligns with the part of the question about encrypting gathered data in log files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. The question does not mention any actions related to moving through a network, so this is not the most plausible choice.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While the question mentions evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypting gathered data, the final action described is targeting stored secrets and credentials, which is more aligned with Credential Access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. The question does not mention any actions related to maintaining access, so this is not the most plausible choice.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to steal credentials. The question specifically mentions targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services, which aligns with the T1555.003 technique (Credentials from Web Browsers).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
