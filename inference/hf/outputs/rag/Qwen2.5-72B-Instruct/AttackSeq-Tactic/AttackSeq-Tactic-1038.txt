### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial tactic used by macOS malware like Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CrateDepression to gain a foothold on target systems before maintaining persistent access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistent access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique involves using a launch agent to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique involves using a launch agent to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on a system. This is the first step in the attack chain and is necessary before any persistence or privilege escalation can occur.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over a compromised system. This typically occurs after initial access and persistence have been established.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. The related TTPs mention persistence techniques, but these are used after the initial access has been gained.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While important, it is not the step that directly leads to gaining a foothold on the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would start with **Initial Access**. The related TTPs focus on persistence and privilege escalation, which are subsequent steps after the initial access has been gained.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
