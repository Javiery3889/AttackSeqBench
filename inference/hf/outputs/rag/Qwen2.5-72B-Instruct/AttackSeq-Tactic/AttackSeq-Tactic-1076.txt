### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the SLUB backdoor.
   - The backdoor first performs discovery by downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet from GitHub for executable commands and retrieving the username and computer name.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the exfiltration of data through uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services, such as GitHub, to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration** - This is the final stage of the sequence described in the question, where data is exfiltrated. It cannot be the tactic that occurs before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which is already described in the question (downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet and retrieving the username and computer name). It is part of the sequence but not the step immediately before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The use of web services (GitHub) to download commands and the subsequent actions suggest that the backdoor is receiving commands from a C2 server. This fits well as the step immediately before exfiltration, as the C2 server would likely instruct the backdoor to exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the exfiltration of data.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
