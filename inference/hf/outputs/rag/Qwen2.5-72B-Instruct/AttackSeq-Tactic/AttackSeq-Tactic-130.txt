### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where files of interest are discovered and enumerated, and then exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system and preparing it for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data using various methods, including Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from remote systems and preparing it for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying system and network information, which is a prerequisite for knowing what files to collect. However, the question already states that files of interest have been discovered and enumerated, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems. While this could be part of a broader attack, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of files that have already been discovered.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact** - This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the availability and integrity of systems and data. This is not relevant to the exfiltration process.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which aligns with the techniques T1074.001 (Local Data Staging) and T1074.002 (Remote Data Staging). These techniques are directly related to preparing data for exfiltration, which is the next logical step after discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the **Collection** tactic occurred before the exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
