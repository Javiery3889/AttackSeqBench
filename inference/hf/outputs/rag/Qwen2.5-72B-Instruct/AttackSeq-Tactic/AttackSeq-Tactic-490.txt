### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that the Pierogi backdoor has already collected system information during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step involves the backdoor taking screenshots and executing arbitrary commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to taking screenshots or executing arbitrary commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. The question already states that the Discovery phase has been completed, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is not relevant to the current context of taking screenshots and executing commands.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. The technique T1113-Screen Capture, which is listed in the related TTPs, falls under the Collection tactic. This aligns with the backdoor's capability to take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the Discovery phase, the backdoor moves to the Collection phase to take screenshots and execute commands.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
