### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving Taidoor malware:
     - **Initial Event:** Taidoor used identifiable network traffic with obfuscated MAC addresses in GET and POST requests for HTTP communication.
     - **Final Event:** The malware uploaded files to the C&C server to exfiltrate victim data.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Event (T1071.001-Web Protocols):**
     - The malware is using HTTP/HTTPS to communicate with the C&C server, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Final Event (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel):**
     - The malware is exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which is part of the Exfiltration tactic.
   - **Intermediate Tactic:**
     - The question asks for the tactic that occurred between these two events.
     - **Impact (A):** This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems, which does not fit the context of communication and data exfiltration.
     - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which could be relevant but is not the most likely intermediate step in this sequence.
     - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which is already part of the initial event.
     - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system, which could be a plausible intermediate step but is less likely given the context of the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible intermediate tactic is **Command and Control** because it involves maintaining the communication channel with the C&C server, which is necessary before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
