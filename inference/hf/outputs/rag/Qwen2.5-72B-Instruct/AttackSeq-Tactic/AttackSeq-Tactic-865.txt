### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that ensures the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup after the execution of "vba_macro.exe" via the Shell command.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.004 - Unix Shell Configuration Modification:** This technique involves modifying shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`) to ensure that a command or script is executed every time a user logs in or starts a new shell session.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute commands or other scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. It does not ensure that a dropper is executed on every system startup.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It does not ensure that a dropper is executed on every system startup.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. It does not ensure that a dropper is executed on every system startup.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. The related TTP (T1546.004) specifically mentions modifying shell configuration files to ensure that a command or script is executed on every system startup, which aligns with the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
