### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when SparrowDoor collected system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
   - The sequence of events is: obtaining credentials with a custom version of Mimikatz, collecting system information, and then reading file contents for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include file contents.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which is typically done for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which could include file contents. However, the question specifically asks about collecting system information, which is more aligned with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact** - This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the availability or integrity of systems and data. It does not fit the context of collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which aligns perfectly with the described action of collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which is not relevant to the described action of collecting system information after obtaining credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred when SparrowDoor collected system information.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
