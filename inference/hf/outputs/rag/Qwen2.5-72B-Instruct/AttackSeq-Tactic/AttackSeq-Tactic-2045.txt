### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Iron Tiger gained access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers through a supply chain attack.
   - The key points are:
     - Iron Tiger has already gained access.
     - The access was through a supply chain attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.003 - Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain**
   - These TTPs all fall under the **Initial Access** tactic, which indicates that the initial compromise of the Mimi chat developer's backend was achieved through a supply chain attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves gathering resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious tools. It typically occurs before the initial access.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. It typically occurs after the attacker has gained access and established a presence in the network.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which has already been achieved through the supply chain attack.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It typically occurs after the initial access to maintain persistence and avoid being detected.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Since the question states that Iron Tiger has already gained access through a supply chain attack, the next logical step would be to perform actions that follow the initial access.
   - **Exfiltration** (B) is a plausible next step after gaining initial access, as the attacker would likely want to steal data from the compromised system.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
