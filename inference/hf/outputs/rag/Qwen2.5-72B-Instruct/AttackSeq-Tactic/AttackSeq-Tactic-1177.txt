### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - First, APT28 installed key components to the disk using a second stage dropper.
     - Next, APT28 used a tool to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability to execute files with elevated permissions.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Privilege Escalation** and the technique is **T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**.
   - This suggests that the action of exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability is part of the Privilege Escalation tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This aligns with the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question. The action of exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability to execute files with elevated permissions is a clear example of the Privilege Escalation tactic.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not fit the immediate sequence described in the question.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While this could be relevant, it does not directly fit the sequence of exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information to plan future attacks. This is typically an earlier step in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Privilege Escalation tactic occurred after the installation of key components and before the exploitation of the privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation**
