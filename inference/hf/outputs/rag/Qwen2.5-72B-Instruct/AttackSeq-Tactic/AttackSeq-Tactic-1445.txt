### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the adversary tricked users into executing malware using malicious DLLs via DLL Hijacking.
   - The key technique mentioned is DLL Hijacking, which is a form of DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by the system or security software.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique is used to maintain access to the system over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection (Tactic: Collection) involves gathering data from the system, which is not directly related to the execution of malware via DLL Hijacking.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution (Tactic: Execution) involves running malicious code on the system. This is a plausible step before DLL Hijacking, as the adversary needs to execute the malicious DLL.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence (Tactic: Persistence) involves maintaining access to the system. While DLL Hijacking can be used for persistence, it is more likely that the initial execution of the malware occurs before setting up persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion) involves techniques to avoid detection. DLL Hijacking itself is a form of defense evasion, so this tactic is more likely to occur simultaneously with or after the initial execution of the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversary first executed the malicious code (Execution) before using DLL Hijacking for defense evasion or persistence.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the adversary tricked users into executing malware using malicious DLLs via DLL Hijacking is **Execution**.

Final Answer: B: Execution
