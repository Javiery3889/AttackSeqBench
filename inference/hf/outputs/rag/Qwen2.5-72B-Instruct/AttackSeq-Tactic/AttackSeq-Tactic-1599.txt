### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious Microsoft Word .DOC file exploits the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to drop the main module "net.exe."
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution**
     - **Technique: T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution**
   - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
     - While persistence is a common follow-up tactic, it is not the most immediate or likely next step after exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.
     - This is a plausible next step, but it is not the most immediate or likely next step after exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network.
     - The exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a malicious .DOC file is already part of the initial access phase, so this answer does not fit the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and control (C2) involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network.
     - After exploiting the vulnerability and dropping the main module "net.exe," the next logical step would be to establish command and control to further control the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability and dropping "net.exe" is to establish command and control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
