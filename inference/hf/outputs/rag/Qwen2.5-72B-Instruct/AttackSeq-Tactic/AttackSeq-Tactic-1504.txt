### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers used Mimikatz to capture passwords and conducted targeted attacks with the core malware Anunak.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers employed RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves capturing credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is a common use case for tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle but does not directly relate to the use of Mimikatz or RDP.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. While it is a crucial step, it does not specifically relate to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While it is a common follow-up to initial access, it does not directly relate to the use of Mimikatz or RDP.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to steal credentials, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz to capture passwords from LSASS memory. This is a critical step before using RDP for lateral movement and evading detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first used Mimikatz to capture credentials (Credential Access), which they then used to establish remote access via RDP (Lateral Movement).

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
