### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved the exploitation of software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments before Luckycat established persistence using WMI to register a backdoor script.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker used WMI to establish persistence and potentially escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the tactic used to maintain access to the system, which is described in the related TTPs. However, the question asks about the tactic before persistence was established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the system, which can be achieved through various methods, including exploiting software vulnerabilities via malicious email attachments.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly involve exploiting software vulnerabilities through email attachments.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from the target system, which is not relevant to the initial exploitation of software vulnerabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker first used Initial Access to exploit software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments, and then established persistence using WMI.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
