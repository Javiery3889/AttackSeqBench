### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malware maintained persistence using a registry key and before it initiated HTTPS communication with the command and control server to send gathered system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the registry to hide or obfuscate the presence of the malware.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves setting up a registry key to ensure the malware runs at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes T1547.001 and other methods to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Modifying the registry (T1112) is a defense evasion technique, but it is not necessarily the next step after persistence and before command and control communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. While discovery can occur at various stages, it is not specifically tied to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. While execution is a crucial step, it typically occurs earlier in the attack sequence, often before persistence is established.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the command and control server. The question states that the malware initiates HTTPS communication with the command and control server to send gathered system information, which aligns with the command and control tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the malware maintained persistence using a registry key, it would then initiate command and control communication to send gathered system information.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
