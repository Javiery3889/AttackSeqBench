### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT33:
     - They used spear phishing campaigns to gain initial access.
     - They then secured persistence within the networks using botnets.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
   - These TTPs confirm that the initial access was gained through spear phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - This is the tactic that occurs after gaining initial access and before the attacker can maintain long-term presence in the network. However, the question asks what happened before securing persistence.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - This is the tactic that describes the initial entry into the network, which is already described in the question as being achieved through spear phishing.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing for an attack, such as gathering information, developing tools, and setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial access.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network to understand its structure, identify valuable assets, and find vulnerabilities. It typically occurs after gaining initial access and before securing persistence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Initial Access** (gaining entry through spear phishing)
     2. **Discovery** (exploring the network to understand its structure and identify valuable assets)
     3. **Persistence** (securing long-term presence in the network using botnets)
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and securing persistence is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
