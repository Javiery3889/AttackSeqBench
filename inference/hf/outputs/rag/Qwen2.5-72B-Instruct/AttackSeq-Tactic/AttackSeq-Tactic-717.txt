### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Naikon APT group using the Aria-body backdoor. These actions include searching for files, taking screenshots, and enumerating loaded modules.
   - The question specifically asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network connections, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is part of the collection phase.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is also part of the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. The question does not mention any actions related to C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system. The related TTPs include T1113-Screen Capture, which is a collection technique. The question mentions taking screenshots, which aligns with the collection phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. The related TTPs include T1049-System Network Connections Discovery and T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which are discovery techniques. However, the question asks what happened after the discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The question does not mention any actions related to credential access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence is that after the discovery phase, the Naikon APT group moved to the collection phase to gather data, including taking screenshots.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
