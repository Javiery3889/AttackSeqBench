### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the threat actors compromised legitimate websites to host the Emissary Trojan, allowing infiltration onto targeted systems.
   - The key points are:
     - Compromised legitimate websites.
     - Hosting the Emissary Trojan.
     - Infiltration onto targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver a drive-by download to victims.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target:**
     - This technique involves identifying and targeting specific individuals or groups for drive-by attacks.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:**
     - This technique involves acquiring or registering domains to use in future operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, not immediately after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to a system. The question already states that the threat actors have compromised websites to host the Emissary Trojan, which is a form of initial access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control:**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves gathering information from the compromised system. This is also a logical next step after gaining initial access, but it typically follows Command and Control.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question states that the threat actors have already compromised legitimate websites to host the Emissary Trojan, which is a form of initial access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to establish command and control over the compromised system to maintain and expand their presence.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
