### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the supply chain compromise through a compromised software update for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack.
   - The attack in question is the UNC2452 attack, which involved a supply chain compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary compromising a third-party software supply chain to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This sub-technique specifically involves compromising the software supply chain to deliver malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is a logical first step in any attack, as the adversary needs to understand the target's environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves the adversary exploring the network to understand the environment and identify valuable assets. It also typically occurs after initial access.
   - **Resource Development (D):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as developing or acquiring malware. It can occur before the attack but is more about the preparation phase rather than the immediate steps leading to initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence of events would be:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** The adversary gathers information about the target and identifies the SolarWinds Orion platform as a potential vector.
     2. **Resource Development:** The adversary prepares the necessary resources, such as the malicious code to be inserted into the software update.
     3. **Initial Access:** The adversary uses the compromised software update to gain initial access to the target network.
   - Among the given choices, **Reconnaissance** is the most plausible tactic that would occur before the supply chain compromise.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
