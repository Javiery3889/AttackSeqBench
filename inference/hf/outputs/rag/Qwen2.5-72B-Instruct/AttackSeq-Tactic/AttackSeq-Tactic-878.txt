### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial compromise using Cobalt Strike's beacon and before gathering Active Directory information with tools like ADFind.
   - The initial compromise is already established with Cobalt Strike's beacon, which is typically used for initial access and command and control (C2).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves the development or acquisition of tools like Cobalt Strike, which is already used for the initial compromise.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS**: This technique involves stealing credentials from the NTDS database, which is a step in gathering Active Directory information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.002-Domain Account**: This technique involves identifying domain accounts, which is a step in gathering Active Directory information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This is the initial step of the attack, which has already been established with the use of Cobalt Strike's beacon.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is a logical step after initial access but before gathering detailed information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the network, which is typically done after gaining the necessary privileges.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection, which can occur at various stages but is not the most immediate step after initial access and before gathering Active Directory information.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After the initial compromise using Cobalt Strike's beacon, the attackers would likely need to escalate their privileges to gain the necessary access to gather Active Directory information.
   - Privilege escalation is a crucial step that allows attackers to perform more advanced actions, such as accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Privilege Escalation
