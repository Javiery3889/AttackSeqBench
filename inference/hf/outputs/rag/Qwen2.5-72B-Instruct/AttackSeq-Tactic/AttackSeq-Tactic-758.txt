### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved in the upload of tools such as Mimikatz and custom backdoors like HyperBro, which occurs after initial access and before establishing persistence via webshells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account:** This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in the system, which is already mentioned in the question as being done via vulnerability exploitation. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the system. While this is a crucial step, the question specifically asks about the upload of tools, which is more aligned with transferring files.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not relevant to the upload of tools.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions, which is not relevant to the upload of tools.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant tactic for the upload of tools such as Mimikatz and custom backdoors is **Command and Control**. The technique T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer specifically describes the transfer of tools into the compromised environment.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
