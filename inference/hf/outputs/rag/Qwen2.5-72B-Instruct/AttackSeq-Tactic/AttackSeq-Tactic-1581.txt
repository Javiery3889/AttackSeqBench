### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses Process Hollowing for defense evasion and then performs discovery using the `CreateToolhelp32snapshot` function to identify the `explorer` process.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial tactic is **Defense Evasion** using the technique **T1055.012 - Process Hollowing**.
   - The next action is **Discovery** using the `CreateToolhelp32snapshot` function to identify the `explorer` process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While this could be a part of the attack, the question specifically asks what happens after the discovery of the `explorer` process, which is not directly related to execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system. The `CreateToolhelp32snapshot` function is used for discovery, but the question asks what happens next, not what is currently happening.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After identifying the `explorer` process, the attacker might use it to establish a command and control channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data of interest from the system. While this is a valid tactic, it is not the most immediate next step after identifying the `explorer` process.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After using Process Hollowing for defense evasion and performing discovery to identify the `explorer` process, the most likely next step is to establish a command and control channel. This is because the `explorer` process is often used as a target for injection or as a pivot point to maintain control over the system.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
