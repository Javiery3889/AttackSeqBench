### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the execution of shellcode in memory and before lateral movement within the internal network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This indicates that the attacker used remote services to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This indicates that the attacker used a Windows command shell to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This indicates that the attacker used PowerShell to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While this could be a step in the attack, the question specifies that the shellcode was executed in memory without writing to the hard disk, which suggests that the execution phase was already completed.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is a common step, the question does not provide specific evidence that defense evasion was the immediate next step after in-memory execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. The question already states that shellcode was executed in memory, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used remote services for lateral movement, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the shellcode was executed in memory, the next step was to move laterally within the network.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
