### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications before achieving persistence through the registry's RUN key.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the persistence was achieved through the registry's RUN key (T1547.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not relevant to the delivery of malware via an automatic update mechanism.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running the malware, which is a step that occurs after the malware has been delivered to the system.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks, which is not directly related to the delivery of malware via an automatic update mechanism.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which can include delivering malware through various methods, including the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware was delivered via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications, which falls under the **Initial Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
