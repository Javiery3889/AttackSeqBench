### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where encrypted backdoors are used in memory, and loader DLLs are configured to evade detection. The next step involves connecting to specific servers for task management.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.001-Environmental Keying:** This technique involves configuring malware to run only in specific environments, which can help evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to load and execute malicious DLLs, which can help evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which can also help evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The question already implies that the backdoors are in place and configured, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. The question does not suggest any new reconnaissance activities; it focuses on the backdoors and their configuration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The related TTPs all fall under the Defense Evasion tactic, but the question asks for the next step after the backdoors are in place and configured.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The question mentions connecting to specific servers for task management, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that after the backdoors are in place and configured to evade detection, the next step is to establish Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
