### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Carbanak group minimized detection by interacting with only a few systems and using a single workstation as a hub for centralized communication with their C&C server.
   - The focus is on what tactic likely occurred after this minimization of detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.005-TFTP Boot:** This technique involves using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to boot a system, which can be used to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the Carbanak group minimized detection, the question asks what happened after this minimization, not during it.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question does not suggest that the group was actively trying to access credentials after minimizing detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. The question does not indicate that the group was trying to escalate privileges after minimizing detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system over time. Given that the Carbanak group used a single workstation as a hub for centralized communication, it is likely that they would want to ensure they can maintain access to this hub. The related TTP (T1542.005-TFTP Boot) supports this by suggesting the use of a persistence technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Carbanak group likely used persistence techniques after minimizing detection to ensure they could maintain access to the single workstation used as a hub for communication with their C&C server.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
