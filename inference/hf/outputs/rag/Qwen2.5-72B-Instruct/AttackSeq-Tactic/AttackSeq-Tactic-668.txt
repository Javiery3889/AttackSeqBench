### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into system processes and before it ensured persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that Dexphot used scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This indicates that Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into system processes.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This is another reference to the use of scheduled tasks, which is part of the persistence tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**: This is the tactic used to ensure that the malware remains on the system after the initial infection. The question states that persistence was achieved through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe`. This is a correct tactic but it is the final step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. The question does not provide any information suggesting that privilege escalation occurred between the process hollowing and the persistence steps.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Process hollowing is a defense evasion technique, and it is mentioned in the question as the first step. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after process hollowing and before persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from the system. The question does not provide any information suggesting that credential access occurred between the process hollowing and the persistence steps.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Defense Evasion** (Process Hollowing)
     2. **[Unknown Tactic]**
     3. **Persistence** (Scheduled Tasks)
   - The most plausible tactic that fits between defense evasion and persistence is **Defense Evasion**. This is because the malware might have used additional defense evasion techniques to maintain its presence and avoid detection before setting up persistence.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
