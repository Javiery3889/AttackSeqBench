### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT10, including the use of dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for command and control (C2) infrastructure.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH:** This indicates that APT10 used SSH for lateral movement within the network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This indicates that APT10 used dynamic-DNS domains for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - The use of dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for interconnected command and control infrastructure aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
     - However, the question asks what happened **after** these actions, so this is not the final step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is typically a step before or during the initial compromise and lateral movement.
     - This does not fit well with the sequence described, as the question implies that the C2 infrastructure is already established.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques to gather data from the target system, which is a logical next step after establishing command and control and lateral movement.
     - This fits well with the sequence described, as the attackers would likely want to collect data after setting up their C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques to gather information about the target network, which is typically a step before or during the initial compromise and lateral movement.
     - This does not fit well with the sequence described, as the question implies that the C2 infrastructure is already established.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that after establishing the command and control infrastructure, the attackers would move to the Collection phase to gather data from the target system.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
