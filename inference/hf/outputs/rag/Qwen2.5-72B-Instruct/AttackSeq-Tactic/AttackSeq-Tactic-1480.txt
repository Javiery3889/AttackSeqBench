### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the BlackEnergy 3 malware gains initial access through a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
   - After gaining initial access, the malware is propagating within the network.
   - Before achieving persistence by registering a binary to the startup shell, we need to identify the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This indicates that the malware is using remote services to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This indicates that the malware is achieving persistence by registering a binary to the startup shell.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This indicates that the malware is also using the same technique to escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, but the question is asking about what happens after initial access and before persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker, which is not directly related to the propagation within the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the malware gathering information about the network and systems, which is a logical step before lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malware, which is part of the initial access phase and not specifically related to propagation.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After gaining initial access, the malware would likely need to discover the network and systems to understand how to propagate.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using remote services to move laterally, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Discovery
