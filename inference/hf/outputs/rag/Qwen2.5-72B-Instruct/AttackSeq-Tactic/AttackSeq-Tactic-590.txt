### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have used sophisticated methods to masquerade their backdoor connection as an SSL connection to avoid detection. The next step in the attack sequence is targeting the contents of source code repositories within the compromised networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves naming or placing files, directories, or other system entities in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malicious code or to gain access to additional systems.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves renaming or masquerading files, directories, or other system entities to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - The related TTPs T1036 and T1036.005 both fall under the Defense Evasion tactic. These techniques are used to avoid detection by making the backdoor connection appear legitimate.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is not directly related to the described scenario of masquerading a backdoor connection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the compromised system, which is a step that would typically follow the establishment of a backdoor connection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems, which is a step that would typically occur before targeting specific contents like source code repositories.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question states that the attackers have already used sophisticated methods to masquerade their backdoor connection as an SSL connection to avoid detection. This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, specifically the techniques T1036 and T1036.005.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to discover and target the contents of source code repositories, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Discovery
