### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where files are executed, a first-stage downloader retrieves a PlugX file, and the PlugX file connects to a C2 domain.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:** This technique involves the adversary staging collected data in a local directory or drive for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the initial file execution and C2 communication described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with systems they control within a target network. While the C2 communication is mentioned in the question, it is a result of the file execution and not a precursor to it.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves the techniques an adversary uses to gain a foothold in the target network. This could include phishing, drive-by downloads, or other methods to execute initial payloads. The execution of files like "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" and "%TEMP%/adobe.dat" suggests that the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to move laterally or escalate privileges. While credential access can occur before file execution, it is not the most likely precursor to the described sequence of events.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the initial access was achieved, which led to the execution of the files and the subsequent C2 communication.
   - The execution of files and the retrieval of the PlugX file are typical actions that occur after initial access has been established.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
