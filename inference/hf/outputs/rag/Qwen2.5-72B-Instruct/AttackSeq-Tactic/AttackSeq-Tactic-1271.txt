### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms (Defense Evasion) and before using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance (Discovery).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their resources, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to evade detection mechanisms, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over compromised systems. It is typically used after initial access and often after other tactics like Discovery and Persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or accounts. It is often used early in the attack lifecycle but is not necessarily a direct precursor to Discovery.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. It is a logical step after evading defenses and before using tools for detailed reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the target environment. It is typically used after initial access and often after Discovery.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves TG1021 first evading detection (Defense Evasion) and then using tools for target mapping and reconnaissance (Discovery). The most logical step between these two actions is the Discovery tactic, as it involves gathering the necessary information to use the tools effectively.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
