### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Turla used LightNeuron to discover system network configurations and before it used emails to conduct C&C communication with encrypted data hidden in PDF or JPG files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within files (e.g., PDF or JPG) to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. While this is a crucial tactic, it does not fit the sequence described, which is about discovering network configurations and then using emails for C&C.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to a system. This is typically the first step in an attack and does not fit the sequence where network configurations have already been discovered.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the system. This could be a plausible step after discovering network configurations, as the attacker might need to collect additional information before setting up C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. This fits the sequence described, as the attacker would need to set up C&C communication after discovering network configurations and before using emails with hidden data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is **D: Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
