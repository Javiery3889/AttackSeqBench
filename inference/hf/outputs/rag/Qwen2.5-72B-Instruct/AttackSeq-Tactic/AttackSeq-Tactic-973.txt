### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke, a known malware, searches for files on both hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the specific technique is **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**. This technique involves adversaries searching for specific files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is a common next step after discovery, the question specifically focuses on the file search activity, which is more aligned with the Discovery phase.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. The described activity of searching for files and directories matches the Discovery tactic, specifically the T1083 technique.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with the malware to control it. The file search activity does not directly relate to establishing or maintaining command and control.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. While the file search could be a precursor to collection, the primary focus of the described activity is the discovery of files, not the actual collection of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described activity is the **Discovery** tactic, specifically the **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** technique.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
