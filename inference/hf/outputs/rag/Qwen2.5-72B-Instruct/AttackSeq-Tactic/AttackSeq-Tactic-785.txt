### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus Group:
     - They delivered malicious documents containing job offers.
     - These documents activated macros on victims' home computers.
     - They then executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the delivery of the malicious documents and the execution of the malicious code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**
   - This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the activation of macros in the malicious documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include phishing with malicious attachments, which is relevant to the delivery of the malicious documents. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the delivery and before the execution of the malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running code on the victim's system. This aligns with the activation of macros and the execution of the malicious code. However, the question specifies that the execution of the malicious code happens after the tactic we are looking for.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials from victims. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Delivery of malicious documents (Initial Access).
     2. Activation of macros (Execution).
     3. Execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor (Execution).
   - The tactic that fits between the delivery of the malicious documents and the execution of the malicious code is **Execution**. The activation of macros is a form of execution, which is the step that occurs after the initial access and before the execution of the malicious code.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
