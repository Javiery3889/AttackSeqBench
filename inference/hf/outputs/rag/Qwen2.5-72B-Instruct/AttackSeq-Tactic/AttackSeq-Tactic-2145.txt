### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers gather system profile information (OS version, architecture, running processes) to determine which machines to target next.
   - After this, the attackers add or remove domains in the database to manage infected environments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic "Discovery" and the technique "T1082-System Information Discovery" are relevant.
   - "T1082-System Information Discovery" involves gathering information about the system, such as OS version, architecture, and running processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not directly related to gathering system information.
   - **Discovery (B):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the described action of gathering system profile information.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the initial compromise. While it is related to information gathering, it typically occurs before the system is infected.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. It is not directly related to the initial information gathering phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers first performed the "Discovery" tactic to gather system information, and then proceeded to manage the infected environments by adding or removing domains in the database.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
