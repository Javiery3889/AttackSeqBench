### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that Grandoreiro collects victim information such as computer name, username, and installed security products.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred that includes operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval from its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Command and Control**.
   - The specific technique is **T1071.001 - Web Protocols**, which involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is a crucial part of many attacks, it does not specifically involve communication over HTTP with a C&C server.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment. While Grandoreiro does collect victim information, the question specifically asks about communication and command retrieval, which is not a primary focus of the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the compromised system. The related TTPs clearly indicate that the technique used is T1071.001 - Web Protocols, which aligns with the use of HTTP for communication and command retrieval from the C&C server.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the availability of systems and data. It does not involve communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
