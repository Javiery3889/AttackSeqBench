### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Shellbot assigned hardcoded process names to evade detection and before the botnet established communication with the C&C servers using an IRC channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This sub-technique involves using DNS to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering running processes on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - The related TTP for Discovery (T1057-Process Discovery) suggests that the bot might need to discover running processes to understand the environment and potentially evade detection. This could occur after assigning hardcoded process names to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - The related TTPs for Command and Control (T1071-Application Layer Protocol and T1071.004-DNS) suggest that the bot is establishing communication with the C&C server. This would logically occur after the bot has evaded detection and discovered the necessary information about the environment.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the Shellbot assigned hardcoded process names to evade detection and before the botnet established communication with the C&C servers using an IRC channel is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
