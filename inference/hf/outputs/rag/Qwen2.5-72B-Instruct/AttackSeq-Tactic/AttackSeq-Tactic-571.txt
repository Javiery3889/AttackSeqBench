### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the backdoor established persistence by modifying the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load' registry key and before the attacker's use of reconnaissance tools to gather information about the victim's environment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the registry to evade detection or to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves using registry run keys or startup folders to achieve persistence and potentially privilege escalation.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves using registry run keys or startup folders to ensure that a program runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (D):** The backdoor has already established persistence by modifying the registry key, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Discovery (A):** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment, which is mentioned as occurring after the persistence is established.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running malicious code, which could be part of the initial infection or the persistence mechanism, but it is not specifically mentioned as occurring between the persistence and reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which could be relevant if the attacker is trying to hide the persistence mechanism. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after persistence and before reconnaissance.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the backdoor established persistence, the attacker would likely engage in defense evasion to ensure the persistence mechanism remains undetected before moving on to reconnaissance.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
