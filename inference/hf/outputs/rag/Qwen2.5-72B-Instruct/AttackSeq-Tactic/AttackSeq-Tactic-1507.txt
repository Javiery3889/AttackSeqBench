### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers have already compromised domain administrator passwords and gained access to all active domain accounts.
   - The next step in the sequence involves using Metasploit for system reconnaissance and progressing through other networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the attackers used valid domain accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the attackers used the domain accounts to escalate their privileges, likely to gain domain administrator access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely next step after gaining domain administrator access and before using Metasploit for reconnaissance.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question states that the attackers have already compromised domain administrator passwords, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. Given that the attackers have domain administrator access and are preparing to use Metasploit for reconnaissance, lateral movement is a logical next step to spread through the network.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques to steal data. While this could be a later step, it is not the most likely next step after gaining domain administrator access and before reconnaissance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
