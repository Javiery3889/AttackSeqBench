### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after TG1021 used deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers and before they executed sophisticated memory-resident malware on the target systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):**
     - This tactic is already covered by the exploitation of the public-facing application (T1190). The question states that the deserialization attack was used to exploit the IIS server, which is part of the Initial Access phase.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B):**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question does not provide specific evidence that privilege escalation occurred between the exploitation and the execution of memory-resident malware.
   - **Execution (C):**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. The question mentions the execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware, which aligns with the Execution phase.
   - **Persistence (D):**
     - This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to a system. The related TTP (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) is a technique used for persistence, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the question as occurring between the exploitation and the execution of the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that the **Execution** tactic occurred after the initial access and before the execution of the memory-resident malware.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
