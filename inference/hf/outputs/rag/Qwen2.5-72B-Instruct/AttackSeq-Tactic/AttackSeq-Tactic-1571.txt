### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely followed after the `versioninfo.bat` script collected and prepared various information from the user's computer for sending to its destination.
   - The key points are:
     - Information was collected and prepared.
     - The information was intended to be sent to a destination.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the `versioninfo.bat` script collecting information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which is also part of the collection process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. While this is a common tactic, it does not directly follow the collection and preparation of data for sending.
   - **B: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of transferring data out of a network or system. This aligns well with the idea of sending the collected information to a destination.
   - **C: Command and Control:**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it does not directly follow the collection and preparation of data.
   - **D: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system and network. While this is part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not follow the collection and preparation of data for sending.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that after the `versioninfo.bat` script collected and prepared the information, the next step would be to exfiltrate the data to the attacker's destination.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
