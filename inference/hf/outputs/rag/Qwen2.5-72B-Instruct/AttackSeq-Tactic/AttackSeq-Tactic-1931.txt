### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Machete group:
     - They used standard FTP and HTTP ports to communicate with their command and control (C2) servers.
     - They implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely followed these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. It does not align with the described sequence of using standard ports and fallback channels for communication and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from a target network. The related TTP (T1041) specifically mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel, which aligns with the described sequence of using standard ports and fallback channels for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is relevant to the overall attack, it does not specifically follow the described sequence of communication and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The related TTP (T1008) mentions fallback channels, which aligns with the described sequence of using fallback channels for communication. However, the question specifically asks what tactic follows the communication and exfiltration, which is more aligned with exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **B: Exfiltration**.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
