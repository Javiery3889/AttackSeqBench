### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 (Command and Control) method before executing malicious payloads using Cobalt Strike.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.006-Python**
   - These TTPs are all related to the **Execution** tactic, which involves running malicious code on a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that affect the availability or integrity of systems and data, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the deployment of C2 listeners.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - The Execution tactic involves running malicious code, which can include setting up C2 listeners. The related TTPs (T1059, T1059.001, T1059.006) all fall under the Execution tactic, indicating that this is the most relevant choice.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - The Privilege Escalation tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this might be a subsequent step, it is not the primary focus of deploying C2 listeners.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves gaining entry to a system, which typically happens before setting up C2 listeners. However, the question specifically asks about the tactic involved in deploying C2 listeners, which is more aligned with the Execution tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the **Execution** tactic, as it directly relates to the deployment of C2 listeners and the execution of malicious payloads.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
