### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Regin, a sophisticated malware, uses strong encryption and transport protocols like ICMP and HTTP for command-and-control (C&C) operations.
   - The next step involves embedding payload information within cookies during HTTP-based C&C.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for C&C communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection, which can include embedding payload information within cookies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target. While this is a common tactic, it does not directly follow from the described C&C operations and data obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic is already in use as described in the question. The embedding of payload information within cookies is a continuation of the C&C operations, specifically a form of data obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing and sending data out of the network. While it could follow C&C operations, the question specifically mentions embedding payload information within cookies, which is more aligned with maintaining C&C.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target network. The question describes ongoing C&C operations, so this is not the next logical step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of embedding payload information within cookies during HTTP-based C&C, aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
