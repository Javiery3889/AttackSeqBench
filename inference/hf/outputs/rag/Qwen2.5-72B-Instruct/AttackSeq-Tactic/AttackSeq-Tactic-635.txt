### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the TG-3279 actors.
   - They gained credentials from network and system administrators.
   - They then used key hosts running the Conpee or Etso tools to deploy scheduled system tasks.
   - We need to determine what ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
   - These TTPs indicate that the actors used valid accounts (T1078) for persistence, initial access, and privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems. This is typically done after gaining initial access and before lateral movement or persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the network. This is a logical step after gaining credentials and before using specific tools to deploy tasks.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential access involves obtaining credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as the first step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code or commands. This is a broad category and could fit, but it is less specific than lateral movement in this context.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the actors gained credentials, then moved laterally within the network to key hosts, and finally used those hosts to deploy scheduled tasks.
   - Lateral movement (B) is the most logical step between gaining credentials and using key hosts to deploy tasks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
