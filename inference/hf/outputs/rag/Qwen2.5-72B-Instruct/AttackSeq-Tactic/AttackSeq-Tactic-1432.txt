### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where StellarParticle used AdFind and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and systems. This activity is part of the preparation phase to identify and understand the target environment better.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the technique is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.
   - **Discovery** is the tactic where an adversary attempts to map the network and identify systems, network topology, and other useful information to plan further actions.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** specifically involves identifying remote systems and their details, which aligns with the use of AdFind and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the scenario of gathering information.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future operations. While it is related to information gathering, it typically occurs before the initial compromise and is more about external information gathering.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. This is a step that might follow after discovery but is not the immediate next step described in the question.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which aligns perfectly with the use of AdFind and custom tooling to identify pieces of information from Active Directory and systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
