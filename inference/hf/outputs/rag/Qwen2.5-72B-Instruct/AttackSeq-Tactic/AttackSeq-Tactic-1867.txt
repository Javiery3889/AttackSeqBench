### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor has established communication with its C2 server and has sent information about current sessions on the system.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this initial communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):** This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Discovery (T1049-System Network Connections Discovery):** This technique involves discovering system network connections to understand the network environment.
   - **Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel):** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (A):** This tactic is already part of the initial communication with the C2 server, so it is not the next step.
   - **Discovery (B):** After establishing communication with the C2 server, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the system and network environment. This aligns with the T1049 technique, which involves discovering system network connections.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic typically occurs after the attacker has gathered enough information about the network and is ready to move to other systems. It is not the immediate next step after initial communication.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** Exfiltration is the process of stealing data and sending it out of the network. While this can occur after initial communication, it is usually a later step in the attack sequence, often after discovery and lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after the initial communication with the C2 server is to perform discovery to gather more information about the system and network environment.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
