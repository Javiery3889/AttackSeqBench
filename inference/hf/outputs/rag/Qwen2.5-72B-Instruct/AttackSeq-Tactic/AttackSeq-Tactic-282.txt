### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BBSRAT has already communicated with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests and has sent data about the victim’s machine via POST requests.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Command and Control" and the Technique is "T1071.001-Web Protocols."
   - This suggests that the initial communication with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS is part of the "Command and Control" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they are in. While this could happen after initial communication, it is not the most immediate next step after sending data to the C2 server.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the victim’s machine and sending it to an external location. Given that the question mentions sending data about the victim’s machine via POST requests, this is a strong candidate.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining control over the compromised system. The initial communication with the C2 server is part of this tactic, but the question asks what happens after this communication.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the adversary trying to avoid detection. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after sending data to the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that after BBSRAT communicated with the C2 server and sent data about the victim’s machine, the next step would be to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
