### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Trickbot, after connecting to a C2 server to download and execute a payload, deletes files with specific extensions on removable and network drives and replaces them with a copy of the malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks or evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques used to gain an initial foothold in a network. This does not fit the described sequence where files are being deleted and replaced after the initial access has already been established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that affect the availability or operation of systems, such as data destruction or denial of service. While deleting files could be considered an impact, the specific action of replacing them with malware is more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques used to communicate with compromised systems. This does not fit the described sequence where files are being deleted and replaced.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques used to avoid detection or analysis. Deleting files and replacing them with malware is a clear example of defense evasion, as it helps the malware avoid detection and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Trickbot used defense evasion techniques to delete files and replace them with malware.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
