### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells and before running commands for system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands on the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering information about the system and its users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):**
     - This tactic is already covered by the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604, which is part of the initial access phase.
   - **Credential Access (B):**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence of events described.
   - **Discovery (C):**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and its users, which aligns with the system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell.
   - **Execution (D):**
     - This tactic involves running commands, which is part of the sequence but occurs after the webshell is installed and before the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker exploited CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access, installed webshells, and then used the webshell to run commands for system and user discovery. The tactic that fits between these two phases is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
