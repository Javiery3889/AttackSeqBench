### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where APT35 gains access to a corporate device through a spear phishing email and then conducts minimal activity to evade detection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining access and evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the **Initial Access** tactic:
     - T1566: Phishing
     - T1566.002: Spearphishing Link
     - T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment
   - These techniques are used to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. This is typically done after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is often done before or during the initial access phase but not typically after gaining access and before evading detection.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry to a network. The question already states that initial access was achieved through a spear phishing email, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access and before evading detection, as it allows the adversary to perform more actions and potentially go undetected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before evading detection is **Privilege Escalation**.

**Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation**
