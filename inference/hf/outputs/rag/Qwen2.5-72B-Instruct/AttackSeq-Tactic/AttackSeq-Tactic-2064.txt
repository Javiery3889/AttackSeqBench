### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the adversary obtained SSH access and used `wget` to fetch malware samples but before the Turbo Linux Kernel Module was deployed to disk and hidden from detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions:** This technique involves loading a kernel module or extension to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit:** This technique involves using a rootkit to hide the presence of the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The question states that the adversary has already obtained SSH access, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running the malware. The question mentions that the adversary used `wget` to fetch malware samples, which is a step in the execution process.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is typically done before gaining initial access and is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. The question does not mention any credential harvesting activities between obtaining SSH access and deploying the kernel module.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. The adversary obtained SSH access.
     2. The adversary used `wget` to fetch malware samples.
     3. The Turbo Linux Kernel Module was deployed to disk and hidden from detection.
   - The step of fetching malware samples using `wget` is part of the execution process. Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred after obtaining SSH access and before deploying the kernel module is **Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Execution
