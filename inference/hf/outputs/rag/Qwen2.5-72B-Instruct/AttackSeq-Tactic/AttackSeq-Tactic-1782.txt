### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where malware is executed using benign executables that side-load malicious DLLs. These DLLs act as loaders for the PlugX implant.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to ensure continued access to compromised systems using scheduled tasks and registry modifications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic of **Persistence** is relevant, specifically the technique **T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading**.
   - DLL Side-Loading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is a crucial part of many attacks, the question specifically mentions ensuring continued access, which is more aligned with persistence.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. While important, it does not directly relate to ensuring continued access.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to systems over extended periods. The use of scheduled tasks and registry modifications to ensure continued access aligns directly with the persistence tactic.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. While the initial execution of the malware is part of the sequence, the question is specifically about ensuring continued access, which is more aligned with persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures continued access to compromised systems using scheduled tasks and registry modifications is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
