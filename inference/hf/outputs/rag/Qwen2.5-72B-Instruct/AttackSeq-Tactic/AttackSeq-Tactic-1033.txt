### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     - Delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
     - An automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves executing code using Visual Basic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:**
     - This technique involves embedding malicious payloads in legitimate files or applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. This is typically done after initial access and execution, but it is not necessarily a step that must occur before lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from a system. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has already gained access and moved laterally.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to a system. This is the first step in the attack lifecycle, and it has already occurred with the delivery of embedded malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malicious code. This is a logical step after the malware is delivered and before the attacker can use SMB to move laterally.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the delivery of embedded malware and before the automated attack using SMB is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
