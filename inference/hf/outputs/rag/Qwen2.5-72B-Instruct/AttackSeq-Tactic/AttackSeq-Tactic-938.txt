### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to execute commands and install an MSI package on the system.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic involved is **Execution** with the technique **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.
   - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The exploitation of the vulnerability in Microsoft Office is part of the initial access, but the question asks what happens **after** the exploitation.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves the execution of arbitrary code on the system. The exploitation of the vulnerability to execute commands and install an MSI package is part of the execution phase.
   - **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the system. This is not directly related to the immediate actions described in the question.
   - **Resource Development (D):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure to support the attack. This is not relevant to the immediate actions described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the **Execution** tactic occurred after the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
