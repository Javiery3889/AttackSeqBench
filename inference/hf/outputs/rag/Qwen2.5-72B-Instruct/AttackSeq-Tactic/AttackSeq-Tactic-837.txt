### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where PROMETHIUM's malware:
     - Searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files.
     - Encodes and chunks the archive.
     - Sends the archive to a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that follows the step of sending the encoded and chunked archive to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
     - This sub-technique involves using a custom method to archive the collected data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. This is not relevant to the step of sending the archive to a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves communicating with the C2 server to receive commands or send data. While this is related to the C2 server, it is not the primary action after sending the archive.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target system. This is not relevant to the step of sending the archive to a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves transferring data from the target system to an external location. Sending the encoded and chunked archive to a C2 server is a clear example of exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the archive is sent to the C2 server, the next step is exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
