### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved defense evasion by running the SOCKSBOT implant entirely in memory via the `svchost.exe` process.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the interaction with attackers through HTTP status codes and socket communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion has already been achieved by running the implant in memory via `svchost.exe`. The question is asking about the next step, which is not further defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications is a clear indication of C2 activities.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - Impact involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the attack. This is typically a later stage in the attack sequence and does not fit the context of establishing communication with attackers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after achieving defense evasion, the next step is to establish Command and Control to enable interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
