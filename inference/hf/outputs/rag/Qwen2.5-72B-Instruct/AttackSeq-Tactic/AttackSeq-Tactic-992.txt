### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers gained access to high-profile ad networks to distribute malvertising and before they used domain shadowing to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains**: This technique involves the use of domain shadowing, which is a method to avoid detection by using subdomains of legitimate domains.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising**: This technique involves the use of malvertising to distribute malware through legitimate ad networks.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system when they visit a malicious website or a website that has been compromised.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While domain shadowing is a form of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before domain shadowing.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves techniques to gain initial access to a system. The use of malvertising (T1583.008) is a form of initial access, and it fits the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves techniques to prepare for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. While malvertising and domain shadowing are part of resource development, the question asks about the tactic that occurred after gaining access to ad networks and before using domain shadowing.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. This does not fit the sequence described in the question, as it occurs after initial access and before defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers used malvertising to gain initial access to the systems, and then used domain shadowing to avoid detection. Therefore, the tactic that occurred after gaining access to high-profile ad networks and before using domain shadowing is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
