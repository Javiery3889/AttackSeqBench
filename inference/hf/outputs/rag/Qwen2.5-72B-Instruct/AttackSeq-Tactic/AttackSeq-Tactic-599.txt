### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker:
     - Used a stolen digital certificate from IQ Technology to sign Winnti-related attack components.
     - Evaded defenses through DNS tunneling.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests and responses to communicate with a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using a stolen digital certificate to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This is a plausible next step because after evading defenses through DNS tunneling, the attacker would likely establish a command and control (C2) channel to maintain communication with the compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up servers or acquiring tools. It is less likely to occur after the attack components are already signed and defenses are evaded.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic has already been partially addressed by using a stolen digital certificate and DNS tunneling. It is less likely to be the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is less likely to occur after the attack components are already signed and defenses are evaded.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is establishing a command and control (C2) channel to maintain communication with the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
