### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers implemented checks for security software (Defense Evasion) but before the SLUB malware variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information (Collection).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves the attacker discovering security software on the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.001-Environmental Keying:** This technique involves the attacker checking the environment to ensure it is suitable for the malware to run, often to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is what the SLUB malware variant does when it interacts with the Mattermost server to collect system information. However, this is the final step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is what the attackers did when they implemented checks for security software. This is the first step in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which is not mentioned in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system, which fits between the Defense Evasion (checking for security software) and Collection (interacting with the Mattermost server).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Defense Evasion (T1480.001-Environmental Keying):** The attackers implemented checks for security software to evade detection.
     2. **Discovery (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery):** The attackers discovered security software on the system.
     3. **Collection:** The SLUB malware variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information.

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers implemented checks for security software but before the SLUB malware variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
