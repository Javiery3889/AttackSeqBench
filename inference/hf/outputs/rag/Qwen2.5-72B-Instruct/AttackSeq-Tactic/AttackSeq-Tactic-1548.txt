### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers first use anti-analysis techniques and gather data on the victim's computer, including kernel information and anti-virus presence.
   - After this, the backdoor's capabilities are utilized to collect extensive system data like file and process information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred in between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying security software and tools installed on the system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, such as files and process information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, kernel version, and other system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - The related TTPs T1518.001 (Security Software Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery) both fall under the Discovery tactic.
     - These techniques are used to gather information about the system and security software, which aligns with the first part of the question where the attackers gather data on the victim's computer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware.
     - It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the sequence of actions after initial data gathering and before extensive data collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time.
     - It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the sequence of actions after initial data gathering and before extensive data collection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - The related TTP T1005 (Data from Local System) falls under the Collection tactic.
     - This technique involves collecting extensive system data, which aligns with the final part of the question where the backdoor's capabilities are utilized to collect file and process information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial data gathering and before the extensive data collection is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
