### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold in victim networks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this initial foothold was established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This indicates that web shells are used to maintain persistent access to the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This indicates that the initial access was gained through external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services):** This is the initial step where the attacker gains access to the network. This has already occurred according to the question.
   - **Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell):** This is the next logical step after gaining initial access. The web shell is used to maintain persistent access to the network, which aligns with the deployment of web shells mentioned in the question.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is part of the initial exploitation but not necessarily the next step after establishing a foothold.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network, which is typically done after gaining access and establishing persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which can be done at various stages but is not the immediate next step after deploying web shells.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after deploying web shells to establish a foothold is to maintain persistence in the network.

**Final Answer: A: Persistence**
