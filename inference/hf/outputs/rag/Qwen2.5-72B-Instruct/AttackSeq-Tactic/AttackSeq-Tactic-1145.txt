### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Turla's backdoors (RPC and PowerStallion) monitored antimalware logs and Windows process lists for information gathering.
   - The focus is on ensuring that PowerShell scripts avoided detection through payload encryption and AMSI bypass.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This technique involves disabling or modifying tools to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data out of a network. It is not relevant to the initial steps of avoiding detection.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Payload encryption and AMSI bypass are classic examples of defense evasion.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While important, it is not directly related to avoiding detection of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a system. While important, it is not directly related to the initial steps of avoiding detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of avoiding detection through payload encryption and AMSI bypass, aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
