### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where GreyEnergy has already obtained domain administrator privileges using tools like Mimikatz to collect passwords.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves using PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to escalate privileges within the network.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool:** This technique involves developing or using tools to support the attack, such as Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over an extended period. While GreyEnergy might use persistence techniques, the question specifically asks about spreading across the network, which is not directly related to maintaining access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the network. The question states that GreyEnergy has already obtained domain administrator privileges, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. The question states that GreyEnergy has already obtained domain administrator privileges, so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand the attacker's control. Using tools like PsExec and WinExe to spread across the network is a classic example of lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that GreyEnergy used PsExec and WinExe to perform lateral movement across the compromised network.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
