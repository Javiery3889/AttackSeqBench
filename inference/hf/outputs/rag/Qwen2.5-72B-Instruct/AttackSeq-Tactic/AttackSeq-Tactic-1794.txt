### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the banking Trojan collected information like hostname and operating system version from the victim's system.
   - The context is that the Trojan has already evaded detection using legitimate signed binaries and public cloud infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves renaming or placing malicious files in a location that matches legitimate files to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting system vulnerabilities to evade detection mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the hostname and operating system version.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - The technique T1082-System Information Discovery is directly related to collecting information about the system, which matches the question's requirement.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs after initial access and before or after discovery.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system, but it is more focused on the actual data exfiltration rather than the initial information gathering.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While it is a necessary step, it typically occurs before the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
