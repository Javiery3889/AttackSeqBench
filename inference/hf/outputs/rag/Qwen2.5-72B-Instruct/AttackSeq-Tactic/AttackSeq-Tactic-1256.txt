### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial access was gained by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services and before the attackers ensured persistence by creating local admin users and manipulating accessibility tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application):** This technique describes how the attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, such as the 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.
   - **Persistence (T1078.003-Local Accounts and T1136.001-Local Account):** These techniques describe how the attackers ensured persistence by creating local admin users and manipulating accessibility tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it typically occurs after initial access and before or during the persistence phase. However, it is not the most immediate step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system over time. The question explicitly states that persistence was ensured by creating local admin users and manipulating accessibility tools, which are described in the related TTPs. Therefore, this cannot be the answer as it is the final step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to execute additional code to further their objectives, such as establishing command and control or performing other actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the victim's system and network. After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely perform discovery to understand the environment and identify targets for further exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before ensuring persistence is **Discovery**. The attackers would need to gather information about the system and network to plan their next steps, such as creating local admin users and manipulating accessibility tools.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
