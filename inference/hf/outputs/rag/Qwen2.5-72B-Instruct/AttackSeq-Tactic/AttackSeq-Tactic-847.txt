### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware has already established communication with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The focus is on what happens **after** this communication is established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using an asymmetric encrypted protocol that is not typically used for C&C.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary exploring the network to understand the environment. This typically happens before establishing C&C communication, not after.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the adversary sending data out of the network. Given the related TTPs, this is a plausible next step after establishing secure C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving through the network to access other systems. This can happen after C&C communication, but it is not as directly related to the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that C&C communication has been established, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible next step after establishing secure C&C communication is exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
