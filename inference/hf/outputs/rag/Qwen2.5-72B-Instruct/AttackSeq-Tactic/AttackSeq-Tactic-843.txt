### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after initial access was gained through a zero-day exploit in a Word document and before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a spearphishing attachment (T1566.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic is already mentioned as the method used to gain access through the spearphishing attachment. Therefore, it cannot be the answer since it is the starting point of the sequence.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. It is a logical next step after gaining initial access, but it is not necessarily the immediate next step before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. It is often used after gaining initial access to maintain persistence and avoid being detected. However, it is not the most immediate step before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. It is a logical next step after gaining initial access and before conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
