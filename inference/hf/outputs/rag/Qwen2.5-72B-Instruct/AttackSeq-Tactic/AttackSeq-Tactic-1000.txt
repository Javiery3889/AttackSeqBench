### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Pupy backdoor uses the obfs3 protocol to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure after evading detection through JavaScript obfuscation on compromised websites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves altering the appearance of code or data to make it harder to detect or analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - The use of the obfs3 protocol to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure aligns with the Command and Control tactic, specifically the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique. This is because obfs3 is a protocol designed to obfuscate network traffic, making it harder to detect, but it is still used for communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The question does not mention any credential harvesting or access, so this choice is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. The question does not mention any data collection activities, so this choice is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - While the initial evasion through JavaScript obfuscation is part of the Defense Evasion tactic, the use of the obfs3 protocol for communication is more aligned with the Command and Control tactic. The obfs3 protocol is specifically designed to evade detection during communication, but the primary purpose is to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Pupy backdoor used the obfs3 protocol to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
