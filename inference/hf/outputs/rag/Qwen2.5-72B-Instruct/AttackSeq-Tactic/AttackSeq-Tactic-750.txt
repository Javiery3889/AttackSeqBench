### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Gamaredon group:
     - Employing backdoors to list interesting files.
     - Using malicious macros in Word and Excel documents.
     - Propagating through Outlook VBA macros.
     - Searching for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on a system to identify potential targets for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this might be a part of the attack, the question specifically asks about the action of searching for sensitive documents, which is more aligned with the Collection tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. The question describes searching for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives, which is a clear example of the Collection tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. While backdoors might be used for this purpose, the question focuses on the action of searching for documents, not the communication aspect.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The question does not mention any actions related to stealing or using credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the Collection tactic, as the question specifically describes the action of searching for sensitive documents.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
