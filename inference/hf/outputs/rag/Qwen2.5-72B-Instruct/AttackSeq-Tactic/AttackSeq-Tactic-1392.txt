### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10:
     - Conducted internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows and open-source pentesting tools.
     - Staged data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046 - Network Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves mapping out the network to understand the environment.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting and staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that involves actions to disrupt or manipulate the availability or integrity of systems and data. This does not fit between network service discovery and data staging.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This could occur after network service discovery but is not necessarily a prerequisite for data staging.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the final step of removing data from the network. This occurs after data staging, not before.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment. Network service discovery (T1046) is a part of the Discovery tactic. After discovering the network, the next logical step would be to collect and stage data for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after network service discovery and before data staging is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
