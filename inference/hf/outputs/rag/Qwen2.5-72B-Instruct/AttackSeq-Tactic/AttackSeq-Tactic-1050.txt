### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in the ProjectM campaign:
     - Concealing infrastructure using WHOIS protection services.
     - Linking domains for the delivery of additional payloads like Andromeda.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provide context:
     - **Tactic: Resource Development**
     - **Technique: T1583.001-Domains**
   - **Resource Development** involves the adversary acquiring or developing resources to support operations, such as domains, infrastructure, and tools.
   - **T1583.001-Domains** specifically refers to the acquisition of domains to support the adversary's operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis.
     - While concealing infrastructure using WHOIS protection services can be seen as a form of defense evasion, the question asks about what happens after this action.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data.
     - This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves acquiring or developing resources to support operations.
     - The use of WHOIS protection services and linking domains for payload delivery are part of resource development.
     - However, the question asks about what happens after these actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network.
     - After concealing infrastructure and linking domains, the next logical step would be to establish command and control to manage the delivery and execution of payloads like Andromeda.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after concealing infrastructure and linking domains is to establish command and control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
