### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and before they exported data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using existing domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves extracting password hashes from the NTDS.dit file, which is part of the Active Directory database.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync:** This technique involves using the DCSync feature to replicate password hashes from a domain controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials. However, the question asks about what happened after gaining the credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target network. While this could be a plausible step, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this could be relevant, it does not directly fit the sequence of gaining credentials and then exporting data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target network. Given that the question mentions exporting data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases, this is the most relevant tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, APT15 would then proceed to collect data from the Active Directory and SQL databases.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
