### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the NewsBeef APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing PowerShell scripts via malicious Office documents.
     - Downloading and running the Pupy backdoor.
     - Establishing communication with the C2 server using the obfs3 protocol.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the execution of the PowerShell scripts and before the C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it is not the most immediate step after executing PowerShell scripts and before C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. This is not directly related to the sequence described, as the question does not mention credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques to run malicious code. The question already mentions the execution of PowerShell scripts and the Pupy backdoor, which are part of the Execution tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial execution and before C2 communication.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Execution** (PowerShell scripts via malicious Office documents).
     2. **Execution** (Downloading and running the Pupy backdoor).
     3. **Command and Control** (Establishing communication with the C2 server using the obfs3 protocol).
   - The step that fits between the initial execution and the C2 communication is another form of **Execution** (downloading and running the Pupy backdoor).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Execution
