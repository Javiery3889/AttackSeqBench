### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial step where the attacker uses disposable email services like YOPmail to evade detection and conceal C&C (Command and Control) communications.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves the use of email accounts, which can include disposable email services, to support the attack.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting system vulnerabilities to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols to communicate with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - Given that the initial step involves using disposable email services to conceal C&C communications, the next logical step would be to establish and maintain C&C communication. The technique T1071.003 (Mail Protocols) directly supports this.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development typically occurs before the attack to gather necessary resources. Since the question implies that the initial step is already part of the attack, this is less likely to be the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target network and systems. While this is a common next step, it is not directly related to the use of disposable email services for C&C.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is relevant, the use of disposable email services is already a form of defense evasion. The next step is more likely to be establishing C&C.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is to establish and maintain C&C communication using mail protocols.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
