### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT-TOCS:
     - Utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
     - Ran in memory to evade detection without writing to the hard disk.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - Tactic: Execution
     - Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
   - This indicates that the use of PowerShell to execute scripts is part of the Execution tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials from a target. This is typically done before or during the initial stages of an attack but is not directly related to the execution of shellcode or in-memory operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques to gain entry into a network. This is typically the first step in an attack and does not fit the sequence described, which is already in the execution phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques to run malicious code on a target system. The use of PowerShell to execute shellcode scripts is a clear example of the Execution tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques to steal data from a target system. This typically occurs after the attacker has gained control and performed other actions, such as data collection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the use of PowerShell to execute shellcode scripts, which is part of the Execution tactic. The next step, running in memory to evade detection, is also part of the Execution tactic, as it involves running code without writing to the disk to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between these two actions is Execution.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
