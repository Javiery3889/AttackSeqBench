### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT-TOCS.
   - The sequence is: evasion through in-memory operations and multi-beacon communication, followed by using encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain command and control (C2) with the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts or commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evasion through in-memory operations and multi-beacon communication:** This is part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic, as it involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools.
   - **Using encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control:** This is part of the **Command and Control** tactic, as it involves maintaining communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - The question asks what tactic occurred between these two stages. Given the sequence, the most logical step would be to establish a persistent presence on the system to ensure continued access, which is part of the **Persistence** tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after evading detection, the attacker would establish persistence before setting up command and control using encrypted data scripts.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
