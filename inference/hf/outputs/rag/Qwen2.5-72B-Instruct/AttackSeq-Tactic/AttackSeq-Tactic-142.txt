### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor.
   - The sequence starts with the Discovery phase, where files in specified directories are probed.
   - The sequence ends with Command and Control activities, specifically communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique is used to identify the file and directory structure on a system, which aligns with the initial phase of probing files in specified directories.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server, which aligns with the final phase of the sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code or commands on the victim's system. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely next step after file and directory discovery and before C&C communication.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This is the final phase described in the question, so it cannot be the answer to what happens between the Discovery and Command and Control phases.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system, which could logically follow the Discovery phase. After discovering files and directories, the attacker might collect data from those files before communicating with the C&C server.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C&C servers. This is typically done before the attack begins and not between the Discovery and Command and Control phases.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the Discovery phase and before the Command and Control phase is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
