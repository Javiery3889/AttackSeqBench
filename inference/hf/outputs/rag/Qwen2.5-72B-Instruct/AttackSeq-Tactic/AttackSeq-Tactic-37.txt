### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a PowerShell script avoids detection by operating in memory and uses a DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.
   - The key points are:
     - The script avoids detection (Defense Evasion).
     - It operates in memory (Defense Evasion).
     - It uses DCOM to execute files (Execution).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. The question does not mention any credential harvesting or access, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The question mentions that the script avoids detection by operating in memory, which aligns with Defense Evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. The question mentions the use of DCOM to execute downloaded files, which aligns with Execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with and control the compromised system. The question does not mention any communication or control mechanisms, so this is not the most likely answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that the script first evades detection (Defense Evasion) and then executes the downloaded files (Execution).

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
