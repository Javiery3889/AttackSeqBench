### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the victims were lured into running the archived payload that delivered the first stage of Zebrocy components.
   - The key points are:
     - Victims were lured into running the payload.
     - The payload delivered the first stage of Zebrocy components.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which then executes the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the target network. This could be through phishing, drive-by downloads, or other methods. However, the question specifies that the victims were already lured into running the payload, which suggests that the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This typically occurs after the initial execution of the payload, but the question is asking about what happens immediately after the payload is run.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. This is usually a pre-attack phase and not something that would occur immediately after the payload is executed.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malicious code on the victim's system. Given that the victims were lured into running the archived payload, the next logical step is the execution of the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the **Execution** tactic occurred after the victims were lured into running the archived payload.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
