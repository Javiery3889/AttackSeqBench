### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before SideCopy gained initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is a common method for initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement:** Lateral Movement is typically used after gaining initial access to move through the network. It is not a likely candidate for what occurred before initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access:** Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain or maintain access. While this can occur before initial access, it is not the most likely scenario given the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development:** Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is a preparatory step that can occur before initial access but is not as directly related to the specific techniques mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is a crucial step that often precedes initial access, as the attacker needs to understand the target environment to craft the malicious LNK files and infection chain effectively.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that Reconnaissance occurred before SideCopy gained initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
