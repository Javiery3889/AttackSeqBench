### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the establishment of an encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server and just before data exfiltration.
   - The key points are:
     - An encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server is established.
     - Data exfiltration occurs over the same channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an asymmetric encrypted protocol that is not the same as the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the target network. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as the connection to the C&C server is already established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. While this is a necessary step before exfiltration, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs just before exfiltration, not before the connection to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as the connection to the C&C server is already established.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The question states that an encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server is established, and data exfiltration occurs over the same channel. This aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves exfiltration over the C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server was established and just before data exfiltration took place over the same channel.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
