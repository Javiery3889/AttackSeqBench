### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when the DLL file was triggered to carry out malicious activities.
   - The context is that Tickusb avoids detection by altering normal programs to load malicious DLLs and only runs when specific files are executed.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves altering the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one, ensuring the malicious code runs each time the application is launched.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to spread an attack. This is not directly related to the execution of a malicious DLL.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While this is part of the process, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred when the DLL was triggered, which is more about how the execution was achieved.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) is a specific technique under this tactic, which aligns with the scenario of altering normal programs to load malicious DLLs.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is not directly related to the execution of a malicious DLL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the DLL file was triggered to carry out malicious activities as part of a **Defense Evasion** tactic, specifically through DLL Side-Loading.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
