### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FIN8 has already discovered the Domain Controller and performed domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.
   - The next step involves using `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves using tools like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` to discover domain trusts and network topology.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**: This technique involves using `wmic.exe` to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic is already covered by the initial steps of discovering the Domain Controller and performing domain trust discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. Using `wmic.exe` to execute a script on a remote system (the Domain Controller) fits this description.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions. While executing a script on a Domain Controller could be part of privilege escalation, the primary action described is the execution itself, not the escalation.
   - **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. The use of `wmic.exe` to execute a script does not directly align with data collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is **Lateral Movement**. Using `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller is a clear example of lateral movement within the network.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
