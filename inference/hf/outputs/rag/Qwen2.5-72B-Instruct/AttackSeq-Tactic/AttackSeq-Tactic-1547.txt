### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers established persistence through a scheduled task and before they gathered detailed system information.
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Establish persistence through a scheduled task.
     2. Gather detailed system information (hostname, OS version).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):** This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the victim's machine.
   - **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery):** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the hostname and OS version.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described, as it does not fit between establishing persistence and gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the second event in the sequence (gathering detailed system information).
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it does not specifically fit the sequence of events described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence is already established through the scheduled task, so it does not fit the sequence of events after persistence and before gathering system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers established persistence through a scheduled task and then gathered detailed system information. Therefore, the tactic that occurred between these two events is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
