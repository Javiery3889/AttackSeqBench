### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C (Command and Control) traffic and communicates with the C&C server via Tor.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the stolen data being sent to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to encrypt C&C traffic, which is already part of the described sequence.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the C2 (Command and Control) channel, which aligns with the next step in the sequence where stolen data is sent to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic is already part of the described sequence (encrypting and communicating with the C&C server).
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the adversary discovering information about the system, which is not relevant to the next step of sending stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the adversary sending stolen data to a remote location, which aligns with the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack, which is not relevant to the next step of sending stolen data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step is the exfiltration of stolen data to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
