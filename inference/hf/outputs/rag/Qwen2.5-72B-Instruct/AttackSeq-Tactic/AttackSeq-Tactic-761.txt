### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Emissary Panda, starting with the installation of webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence.
   - The next step involves using tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the use of Mimikatz for pivoting.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool):** This involves the acquisition of tools and resources needed for the attack.
   - **Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell):** This involves maintaining access to the system by installing webshells.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer):** This involves moving from one system to another within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access (T1555) involves techniques to obtain credentials such as usernames and passwords. Using tools like Mimikatz is a common method for credential access.
     - This is a plausible step before lateral movement, as the actors would need credentials to pivot to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion (T1070) involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is important, it is not a direct prerequisite for using Mimikatz to pivot.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance (T1592) involves gathering information about the target. While this is important for planning the attack, it is not a direct step before using Mimikatz.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery (T1082) involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. While this is important, it is not a direct step before using Mimikatz.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the actors would need to obtain credentials (Credential Access) before using tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
