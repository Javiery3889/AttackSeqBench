### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where PKPLUG initially gains access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before they employed defense evasion techniques such as DLL side-loading.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This indicates that the initial access was gained through phishing.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This indicates that after gaining initial access, the attackers used DLL side-loading to evade defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, where the attackers gain initial access through spear-phishing emails. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before defense evasion, which is already after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While it is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question specifically asks about the step before defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain further access. It is a plausible step after initial access but before defense evasion, as attackers often need credentials to perform more advanced techniques.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This is the tactic that the question states occurs after the initial access. Therefore, it cannot be the answer to the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred before defense evasion is **Credential Access**. This is because attackers often need to obtain credentials to perform more advanced techniques like DLL side-loading.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
