### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attackers have already established command and control using a backdoor and tunneling techniques.
   - The next step involves manually selecting and compressing valuable intelligence into archives using tools like WinRAR or 7-zip.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves compressing and archiving data to prepare it for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using tunneling to maintain command and control over the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic is already established in the question with the use of the backdoor and tunneling techniques.
     - It does not fit the next step of manually selecting and compressing data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the question.
     - It does not align with the described action of compressing data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is not the focus of the described action.
     - It does not fit the context of compressing data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the compromised system.
     - The action of manually selecting and compressing valuable intelligence into archives is a preparatory step for exfiltration.
     - The related TTP T1560.001 (Archive via Utility) is directly associated with the exfiltration process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Exfiltration**.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
