### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT29 established persistence using stolen credentials and before deploying custom malware like WellMess or WellMail.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This indicates that APT29 used valid accounts (stolen credentials) to establish persistence.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This suggests that APT29 collected credentials for reconnaissance purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after initial access and persistence are established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. Given that APT29 has already established persistence using stolen credentials, it is plausible that they would perform reconnaissance to understand the environment and plan their next steps.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is important, it is often a continuous process and not necessarily a distinct step between persistence and deploying custom malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence:** This tactic is already mentioned as having occurred (using stolen credentials), so it cannot be the answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred after establishing persistence and before deploying custom malware is **Reconnaissance**.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
