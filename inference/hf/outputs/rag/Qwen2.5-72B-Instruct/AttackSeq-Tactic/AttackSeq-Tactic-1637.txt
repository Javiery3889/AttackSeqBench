### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the NetTraveler Trojan is delivered through spear-phishing emails that exploit CVE-2012-0158.
   - It then asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when lookalike news and military domains facilitated communication with compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, deliver a payload to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which is already covered by the spear-phishing emails and the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158. The question is asking about what happens after the initial access.
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the attack and not after the initial access.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The use of lookalike news and military domains to facilitate communication with the compromised systems aligns well with this tactic.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While this is a common next step, the question specifically mentions communication, which is more aligned with Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the lookalike news and military domains facilitated communication with the compromised systems, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
