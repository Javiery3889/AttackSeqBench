### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     - Attackers used compromised email accounts to send malicious Word documents.
     - The documents exploited CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access.
     - The Helminth Trojan achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, where the attackers send malicious Word documents to gain initial access.
   - **Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution):**
     - This is the next step, where the malicious Word document exploits CVE-2017-0199 to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
   - **Persistence (Adding a scheduled task):**
     - This is the final step, where the Helminth Trojan achieves persistence by adding a scheduled task.

4. **Determine the Missing Tactic:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before achieving persistence.
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)
     2. Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution)
     3. Persistence (Adding a scheduled task)
   - The missing tactic between Initial Access and Persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Execution
