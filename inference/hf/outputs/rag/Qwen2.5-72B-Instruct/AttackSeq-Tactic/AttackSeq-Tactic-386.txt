### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the threat actors acquired domain names from multiple registrars and compromised websites to support their malicious infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Resource Development**
     - **Technique: T1583.001-Domains**
   - **T1583.001-Domains** is a sub-technique under the **Resource Development** tactic. This technique involves acquiring domain names to support malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the target network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the initial setup of malicious infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves gaining entry into the target network. While this is a crucial step, it typically follows the setup of the malicious infrastructure, not precedes it.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - The Lateral Movement tactic involves moving through the network to expand access. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the initial setup of malicious infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - The Resource Development tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack. This includes acquiring domain names and setting up compromised websites, which aligns perfectly with the described activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actors first engaged in **Resource Development** to acquire domain names and set up compromised websites to support their malicious infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D: Resource Development**
