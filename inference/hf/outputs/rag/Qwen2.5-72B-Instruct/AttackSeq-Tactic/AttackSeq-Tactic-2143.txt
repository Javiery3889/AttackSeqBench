### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker gains initial access through a trojanized version of the CCleaner application and then gathers system profile information.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and gathering system profile information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:**
     - This technique describes how an attacker can gain initial access by compromising a software supply chain, such as trojanizing a legitimate application like CCleaner.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the attacker gathering information about the system, such as the OS version and installed software.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the attacker identifying installed software on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery:**
     - This tactic aligns with the techniques T1082 and T1518, which involve gathering system information and software details. This is the most logical step after gaining initial access and before gathering system profile information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration:**
     - This tactic involves sending data out of the network, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:**
     - This tactic is already described as the first step in the sequence (gaining access through a trojanized application), so it cannot be the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is a step that typically occurs after gaining initial access but before discovery. However, the question specifically asks about the step before gathering system profile information, which is more aligned with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker performs the Discovery tactic after gaining initial access and before gathering system profile information.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
