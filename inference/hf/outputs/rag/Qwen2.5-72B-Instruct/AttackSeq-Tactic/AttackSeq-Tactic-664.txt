### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory without being written to the system.
   - The context involves the use of base64 blobs embedded in Office documents for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - While DLL side-loading can be used for persistence, the question specifically mentions that the DLL was executed in memory without being written to the system. This suggests a focus on evading detection rather than maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and control (C2) typically involves establishing communication with a remote server. The question does not provide any context suggesting C2 activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial access involves gaining entry to the system, which is typically done through techniques like phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities. The question mentions the use of base64 blobs in Office documents, which is more aligned with initial access, but the focus is on the subsequent execution of the DLL in memory.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The use of base64 blobs and executing the DLL in memory without writing it to the system are clear indicators of defense evasion. The related TTPs also support this, as both T1574.002 and T1140 are defense evasion techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves defense evasion techniques to execute the DLL in memory without being written to the system.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
