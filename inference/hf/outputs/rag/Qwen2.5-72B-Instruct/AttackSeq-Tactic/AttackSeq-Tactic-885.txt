### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10:
     - Conducted privilege escalation using DLL sideloading.
     - Used Mimikatz for credential theft.
     - Accessed Visma's Active Directory domain controller.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between privilege escalation and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading):** This technique is used to gain higher privileges by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.
   - **Credential Access (T1003.006-DCSync):** This technique is used to extract credentials from the Active Directory domain controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves sending data out of the network. It is typically a final step in an attack sequence, not something that occurs between privilege escalation and credential theft.
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question already mentions using Mimikatz for credential theft, which is a credential access technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is a common step in an attack, it is not specifically mentioned in the sequence provided.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. It is a logical step to take after gaining higher privileges to understand the environment before attempting to steal credentials.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After gaining higher privileges through DLL sideloading, the next logical step would be to discover more about the network and systems to identify where valuable credentials are stored.
   - Discovery is a necessary step before credential theft, as the attacker needs to know where to look for the credentials.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
