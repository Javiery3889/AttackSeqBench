### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the spear phishing emails delivered the Etumbot malware and before the backdoor was configured to run at startup through registry modification.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This is a specific type of phishing where an attachment is used to deliver the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It typically occurs before the initial access is gained, not after.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. Configuring a backdoor to run at startup through registry modification is a persistence technique.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It typically occurs after initial access and persistence are established.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target system. The spear phishing emails delivering the malware are part of the initial access phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The spear phishing emails (T1566.001) are part of the Initial Access tactic.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to establish persistence to ensure continued access to the system.
   - Configuring the backdoor to run at startup through registry modification is a persistence technique (T1053, T1547, etc.).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Persistence
