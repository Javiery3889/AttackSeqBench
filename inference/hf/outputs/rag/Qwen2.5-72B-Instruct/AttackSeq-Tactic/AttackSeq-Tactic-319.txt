### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Geumseong121 used a website disguised as a fundraising service to deliver a malicious app to the victims.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into clicking a link that leads to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves an adversary compromising a website to deliver malicious content to victims when they visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):**
     - The technique T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) is directly related to the initial action of compromising a website to deliver a malicious app. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Execution (T1204.001-Malicious Link):**
     - This technique is part of the initial access phase but specifically involves the user clicking a link. It is a method to achieve initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion (A):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It typically occurs after the initial access has been established.
   - **Command and Control (B):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to establish and maintain control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after the initial access and execution of the malicious payload.
   - **Resource Development (D):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to prepare for an attack, such as gathering information or developing tools. It typically occurs before the initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after the initial access via a drive-by compromise would be the execution of the malicious app. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** the initial access.
   - The next logical step after initial access and execution would be to establish command and control to maintain control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
