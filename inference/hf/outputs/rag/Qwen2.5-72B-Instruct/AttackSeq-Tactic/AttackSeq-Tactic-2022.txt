### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the SOCKSBOT implant ensures persistence by creating a Windows service named 'Check for updates' set to 'delay-auto' start and reflectively loaded itself to spoof legitimate services with similar names.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves using Windows services to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the reflective loading and spoofing of legitimate services can be part of defense evasion, the primary focus of the question is on ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the attacker. The question does not mention any command and control activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system. The question explicitly describes creating a Windows service to ensure the implant remains on the system, which is a clear example of persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
