### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus phishing kit and mailings with macro-laden attachments have successfully introduced Raccoon stealer into the victim environment.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this initial compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites.
   - **Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that contain malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link):** This is the initial step where the attacker gathers information and sends the phishing link. This is part of the initial access phase.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This is the step where the attacker sends the phishing email with a macro-laden attachment, which is also part of the initial access phase.
   - **Execution (T1059):** This tactic involves the execution of the malicious code (Raccoon stealer) once it has been delivered to the victim's environment. This is the next logical step after initial access.
   - **Collection (T1005, T1039, etc.):** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's environment, which typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and executed the initial payload.
   - **Credential Access (T1003, T1056, etc.):** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the victim, which can occur after the initial access and execution of the payload.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question states that the Raccoon stealer has been successfully introduced into the victim environment. This implies that the initial access and execution phases have already been completed.
   - The next logical step after the execution of the Raccoon stealer would be to collect data or attempt to gain further access to credentials.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context, the most plausible next step after the initial access and execution of the Raccoon stealer would be to attempt to collect data or credentials.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
