### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Desert Falcons gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred as they managed three separate campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over their victims.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's system. While this could be a later step in the attack, it does not align with the context of managing multiple C&C/IPs to maintain control.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This tactic is already described in the question as the initial step (spear-phishing and targeted Facebook attacks). It does not fit the context of managing multiple C&C/IPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the victim before the attack. While it is a crucial step, it does not align with the context of managing multiple C&C/IPs.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the compromised systems. Managing multiple C&C/IPs to maintain control over victims is a key aspect of this tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of managing multiple C&C/IPs to maintain control over victims, the most plausible answer is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
