### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a backdoor program has already gathered host information and executed evasion techniques.
   - The next step in the sequence is to establish communication with the C2 (Command and Control) server via DNS tunneling.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Command and Control** and the specific technique is **T1071.004-DNS**.
   - **Command and Control (C2)** is the tactic that involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system to execute commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **T1071.004-DNS** is a sub-technique under the Command and Control tactic, which describes the use of DNS (Domain Name System) for communication between the compromised system and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network. While this might have occurred earlier in the attack, it is not the next step after evasion techniques.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain a foothold in the network. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as the backdoor is already present.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. This is not the next step after evasion and gathering host information.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The use of DNS tunneling (T1071.004) is a specific technique under this tactic, making it the most relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
