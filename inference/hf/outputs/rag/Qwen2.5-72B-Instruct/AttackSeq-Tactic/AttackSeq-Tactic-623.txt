### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after obtaining valid credentials for lateral movement and prior to the collection of relevant data.
   - The focus is on the step where the attacker locates relevant systems, users, and data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is already assumed to have occurred in the question.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to access additional systems, which is a step that would occur after discovery.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network, systems, and users, which is the step needed to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data of interest, which is the final step after discovery and lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after obtaining valid credentials and before collecting relevant data is **Discovery**. This is because the attacker needs to locate the relevant systems, users, and data before they can move laterally or collect the data.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
