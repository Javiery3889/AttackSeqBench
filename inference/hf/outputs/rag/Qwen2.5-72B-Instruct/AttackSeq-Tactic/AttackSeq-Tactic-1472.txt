### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Welcome Chat app exfiltrated SMS messages, call logs, and GPS location information from targeted devices.
   - The key action here is the exfiltration of data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While C2 is necessary for exfiltration, it typically occurs before or concurrently with exfiltration, not after.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. It is generally a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not the most likely next step after exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. However, the question states that the data has already been exfiltrated, so collection has already occurred.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the data has been exfiltrated, the most logical next step in the attack sequence would be to use the exfiltrated data for further actions, such as command and control operations. The exfiltration itself is part of the Exfiltration tactic, and the use of a C2 channel (T1041) is a common method for exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
