### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Hellsing APT group used spear-phishing documents with a specific exploit (CVE-2012-0158) to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - After gaining access, the backdoor connected to a server to perform actions like uploading and downloading files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target network. The spear-phishing documents and the CVE-2012-0158 exploit are part of the initial access phase.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The backdoor connecting to the server to upload and download files is a clear indication of command and control.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target system and network. While this might occur after gaining access, it is not the primary focus of the described actions.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. The described actions do not indicate lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that after gaining initial access, the backdoor connected to the server to perform command and control activities.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
