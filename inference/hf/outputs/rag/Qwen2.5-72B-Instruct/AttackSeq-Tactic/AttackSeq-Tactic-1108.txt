### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers gained access to an Afghan Government's CDN server and modified a JavaScript file (jquery-1.4.2.min.js) as part of a strategic web compromise.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this initial access and modification.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189). This technique involves placing malicious content on a website that is frequently visited by the target, which then leads to the execution of the malicious content on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. After gaining initial access and modifying the JavaScript file, the attackers would likely need to establish C2 to maintain control and execute further actions.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is a common next step, it is not the most immediate action after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described in the question as the initial drive-by compromise. It cannot be the next step after initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, which typically occurs before the initial access, not after.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access and modifying the JavaScript file would be to establish command and control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
