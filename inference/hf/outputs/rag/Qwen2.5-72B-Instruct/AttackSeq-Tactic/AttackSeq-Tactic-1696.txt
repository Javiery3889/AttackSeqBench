### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Shamoon malware overwrote the disk's boot records, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR), preventing access to the affected file systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique involves modifying the boot process to maintain persistence. However, this is not directly relevant to the question since the question is about the aftermath of the disk overwrite.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe:** This technique involves wiping the disk structure, which aligns with the described action of overwriting the MBR and VBR, preventing access to the file systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure. It is not relevant to the aftermath of overwriting the disk's boot records.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While this might be part of the initial infection, it does not describe the impact of overwriting the boot records.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or system disruption. The technique T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe directly aligns with the described action of overwriting the MBR and VBR, which results in preventing access to the file systems.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. It is not relevant to the aftermath of overwriting the disk's boot records.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the **Impact** tactic, as it directly relates to the consequences of overwriting the disk's boot records.

**Final Answer: C: Impact**
