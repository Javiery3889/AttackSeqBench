### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware has already scanned for files with specific extensions and staged the data on the victim's system. The next step in the attack sequence is to send the prepared data to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves the attacker staging data on the victim's system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the attacker sending data from the victim's system to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119 - Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automated collection of data on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. It does not fit the context of sending data to a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the process of stealing data from the victim's system and sending it to an attacker-controlled location. The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) directly supports this choice.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While the related TTPs T1074.002 and T1119 are part of the collection process, the question specifically asks about the next step after data has been staged.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. It does not directly involve the exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the data has been staged, the next step is to exfiltrate the data to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
