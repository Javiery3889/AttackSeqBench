### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where FIN8 used a malicious PowerShell command line via BADHATCH to download and execute a script for accessing networks.
   - The key elements are:
     - Use of a malicious PowerShell command line.
     - Downloading and executing a script.
     - Accessing networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**
   - This TTP indicates that the use of PowerShell for command-line execution is part of the Execution tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. It typically occurs before the actual attack.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which could be through various means like phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities. The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script could be part of Initial Access, but the question implies that the script is already being executed, which is more aligned with the Execution tactic.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script is not typically part of Reconnaissance.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script is a clear example of the Execution tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Execution tactic occurred after FIN8 used a malicious PowerShell command line via BADHATCH to download and execute a script for accessing networks.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
