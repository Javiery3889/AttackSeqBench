### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers initially gain access through watering hole attacks (drive-by compromise) using specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782).
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers then elevate privileges using a PowerShell loader to exploit another vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458).
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website or link.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** This is the first step where the attackers gain initial access through watering hole attacks.
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation):** This is the final step where the attackers use a PowerShell loader to exploit CVE-2019-1458 to elevate privileges.
   - The question asks what likely occurred between these two stages.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. It is typically a later stage in an attack and does not fit between initial access and privilege escalation.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This is the final step in the sequence described, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. It is a logical step after gaining initial access and before privilege escalation, as attackers often need to move laterally to find the right system to escalate privileges.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While it can occur after initial access, it is often part of the initial access itself or a step that leads directly to privilege escalation.

### Final Answer:
Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and privilege escalation is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
