### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events: exploiting CVE-2012-0158, implanting the PlugX RAT via spear-phishing emails, and then implementing persistence mechanisms.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between the exploitation and the implementation of persistence mechanisms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system over time. The question states that persistence mechanisms are implemented after the exploitation and implantation of the RAT, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system. While privilege escalation might occur after initial access, the question does not provide evidence that this is the next step before implementing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target system and network. Discovery often occurs after gaining initial access and before implementing persistence to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code on a target system. The exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 and the implantation of the PlugX RAT via spear-phishing emails are both part of the execution phase. However, the question asks about the next step after these actions and before persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the exploitation and the implementation of persistence mechanisms is **Discovery**. This is because the attacker would likely need to gather information about the system and network to determine the best way to maintain access.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
