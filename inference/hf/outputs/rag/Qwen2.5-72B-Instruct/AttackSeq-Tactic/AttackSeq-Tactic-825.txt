### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Buckeye modified open source hacking tools to evade detection with Backdoor.Pirpi but before focusing on file and print servers to steal documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This indicates that Buckeye used or modified existing tools for their operations.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This suggests that Buckeye attempted to evade detection by deleting files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**: Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. This could occur after gaining initial access and evading detection, but it is not necessarily the next step before focusing on file and print servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**: Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is a common step after initial access and before moving laterally or focusing on specific targets.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems. This is a crucial step after gaining initial access and evading detection, and before focusing on specific targets like file and print servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**: Collection involves gathering data from the target systems. This is a step that would occur after gaining access and discovering the network, and before exfiltrating the data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence described in the question, the most logical step after modifying tools to evade detection and before focusing on file and print servers to steal documents is to discover the network and identify the relevant systems.
   - Discovery (Tactic: Discovery) is a critical step in understanding the network topology and identifying the file and print servers that contain the documents of interest.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
