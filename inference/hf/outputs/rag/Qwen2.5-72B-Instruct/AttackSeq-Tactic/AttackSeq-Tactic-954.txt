### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SWEED group.
   - They exploited CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document.
   - After the exploitation, they used techniques like T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the exploitation and the stealth techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Excel) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - This is the initial step where the attacker exploits the vulnerability in the Excel document to gain execution.
   - **File Deletion (T1070.004):**
     - This is a defense evasion technique used to remove traces of the attack.
   - The question asks what tactic occurred between these two steps.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A):**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. It is often a step after initial execution but before stealth techniques.
   - **Execution (B):**
     - This tactic is already covered by the initial exploitation (T1203).
   - **Resource Development (C):**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure for an attack, which typically happens before the initial exploitation.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which aligns with the file deletion and software packing mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Execution (T1203):** Exploit the vulnerability in the Excel document to gain initial execution.
     2. **Privilege Escalation (A):** Gain higher-level permissions on the system.
     3. **Defense Evasion (T1070.004):** Use file deletion and software packing to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation
