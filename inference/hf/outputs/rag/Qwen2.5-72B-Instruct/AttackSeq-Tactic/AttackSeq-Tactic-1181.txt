### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before APT28 identified vulnerable systems by reporting scanning results to a centralized server following their IP range scans.
   - The key activities mentioned are:
     - Scanning IP blocks (T1595.001)
     - Vulnerability scanning (T1595.002)
     - Reporting scanning results to a centralized server

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:**
     - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify active hosts and open ports.
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities on identified hosts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from various sources, but it typically occurs after initial access and during the exploitation phase. It is not a pre-access activity.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is a step that usually follows the identification of vulnerable systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the target network. This is a step that follows the identification of vulnerable systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target network, such as network topology, system configurations, and vulnerabilities. This is a pre-access activity that aligns with the scanning and vulnerability identification described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 first performed discovery activities to identify vulnerable systems before reporting the results to a centralized server.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
