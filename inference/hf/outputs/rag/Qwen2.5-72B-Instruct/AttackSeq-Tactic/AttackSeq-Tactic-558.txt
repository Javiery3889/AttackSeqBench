### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of the QuasarRAT dropper, specifically focusing on the creation and management of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence beyond a reboot.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves adversaries using scheduled tasks to execute code at a specified time or in response to certain events. This is a common method for maintaining persistence on a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not related to maintaining persistence.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it can occur after initial compromise, it is not directly related to maintaining persistence on a single system.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. Creating and managing scheduled tasks to ensure the malware runs after a reboot is a classic example of persistence.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. While it is crucial for managing the malware, it is not directly related to maintaining persistence on the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: Persistence**.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
