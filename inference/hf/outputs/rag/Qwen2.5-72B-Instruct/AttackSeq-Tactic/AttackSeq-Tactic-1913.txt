### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after NanHaiShu used techniques such as base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation to hinder detection of the decoy XLS and JScript file.
   - The key techniques mentioned are base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation, which are methods used to obfuscate and encode files or information to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to hide the true nature of files.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating commands to make them harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This is a broader technique that encompasses various methods of obfuscation to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. The techniques mentioned (base64 encoding and URL string obfuscation) are not typically used for reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target system. While obfuscation can be used in initial access, the question specifically mentions that the techniques were used to hinder detection of a decoy file, which is more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system after gaining access. The techniques mentioned are not typically used for discovery.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and analysts. The techniques mentioned (base64 encoding and URL string obfuscation) are directly related to defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the techniques were used for **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
