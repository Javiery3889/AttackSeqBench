### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information to identify exposed and misconfigured Docker API ports before the actual exploitation for Initial Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems and applications to identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations to understand the network environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources (e.g., infrastructure, tools) for an attack. It does not directly involve scanning for vulnerabilities or collecting information about targets.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. It is not relevant to the initial phase of identifying vulnerable hosts.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. While T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) is part of this tactic, it is the exploitation phase, not the information gathering phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. T1595.002 (Vulnerability Scanning) is a specific technique under this tactic that aligns with the question's description of scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that the attackers first performed **Reconnaissance** to scan for vulnerable hosts and collect information about exposed and misconfigured Docker API ports before exploiting them for Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
