### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving ShadowPad, a malware that uses DLL sideloading to deploy and execute. It mentions custom decryption algorithms and payload injection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic ensures the malware remains active even after system restarts or interruptions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to ensure that the malware is executed whenever the legitimate application is run.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the system, which is not related to ensuring the malware remains active after system restarts.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - Impact involves altering the system to achieve the attacker's goals, such as data destruction or denial of service, which is not related to persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malware, but it does not ensure that the malware remains active after system restarts.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that ensure the malware remains active even after system restarts or interruptions. DLL side-loading, as mentioned in the related TTPs, is a persistence technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is the one that ensures the malware remains active after system restarts or interruptions, which is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
