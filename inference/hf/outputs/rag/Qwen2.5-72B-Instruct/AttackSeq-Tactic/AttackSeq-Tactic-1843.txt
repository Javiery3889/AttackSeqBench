### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before BlueDelta redirected victims' future incoming emails to an actor-controlled address by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves developing and using email accounts for malicious purposes.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to redirect emails to an actor-controlled address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most likely initial step before setting up email forwarding.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution:**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a system. This could be part of the process but is not the initial step in gaining access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from a system. This would typically occur after gaining access and setting up email forwarding.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the first foothold in a system. The related TTP T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application directly supports this as the initial step before setting up email forwarding.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described, the most plausible initial step is gaining access to the system by exploiting a vulnerability in the Roundcube webmail software.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
