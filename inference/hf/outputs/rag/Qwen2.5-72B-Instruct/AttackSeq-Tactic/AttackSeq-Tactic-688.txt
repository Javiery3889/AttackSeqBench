### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros.
   - The backdoor program then employed persistence by writing startup items.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is used to maintain persistence by adding a program to the registry run keys or startup folder.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is also used to maintain persistence by adding a program to the registry run keys or startup folder.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves gaining initial access to a system by sending a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains initial access to the system by sending a malicious Excel document with embedded macros.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malicious code within the Excel document. This is necessary to run the backdoor program.
   - **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):**
     - Once the backdoor program is executed, the attacker will likely want to ensure that the program runs every time the system starts up. This is achieved by writing startup items, which is a persistence technique.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Collection:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the system, which is also not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)
     2. Execution (to run the backdoor program)
     3. Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder)

   Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the backdoor program employed persistence by writing startup items is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
