### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where EyePyramid malware has already established communication with C&C servers and is using email addresses to exfiltrate stolen data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP) to communicate with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. However, the question states that communication with C&C servers has already been established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. The question does not mention any new execution of code after the C&C communication is established.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The question does not mention any reconnaissance activities after the C&C communication is established.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from the victim's system to the attacker's system. The question specifically mentions exfiltrating stolen data using email addresses, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic and the T1041 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Exfiltration tactic occurred after the EyePyramid malware established communication with the C&C servers.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
