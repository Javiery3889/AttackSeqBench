### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec, given that they have already used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash for credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves using tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials from the LSASS memory.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate and move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is also listed under defense evasion, indicating that pass-the-hash can be used to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - The threat actors have already used Mimikatz to dump credentials from the LSASS memory (T1003.001).
     - They have then used Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash (T1550.002) for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec. This is a plausible next step after obtaining credentials and using pass-the-hash.
   - **Permission Groups Discovery:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally.
     - Permission groups discovery (T1069) is a common tactic used to understand the permissions and roles of different users and groups in the network. This can be done at various stages of the attack, but it is often performed after gaining initial access and before or during lateral movement to identify high-value targets.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is possible to perform permission groups discovery after moving laterally, it is not necessarily the only logical sequence. Threat actors might perform permission groups discovery at multiple stages of the attack, including after initial access and before lateral movement to identify targets.
   - The question implies a strict sequence where permission groups discovery is done only after lateral movement, which is not the most common or only logical sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
