### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor Earth Lusca will target user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz only after scanning for machines in the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
   - The key points are:
     - Exploiting remote services for lateral movement.
     - Scanning the network environment.
     - Targeting user credentials using specific tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is often done using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210):**
     - This is a common initial step in lateral movement, where the attacker gains access to a remote system by exploiting a vulnerability in a service.
   - **Scanning the Network Environment:**
     - Before targeting user credentials, it is logical for an attacker to scan the network to identify potential targets and understand the network topology. Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Targeting User Credentials (T1003.001):**
     - Once the attacker has a better understanding of the network and has gained access to a remote system, they may then proceed to extract credentials from the LSASS memory using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (scanning the network, then exploiting remote services, and finally targeting user credentials) is a logical and common attack pattern.
   - It aligns with the related TTPs, where the attacker first gains a foothold in the network, then moves laterally, and finally targets credentials to maintain and expand their access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
