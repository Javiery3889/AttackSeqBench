### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where RIG EK (Exploit Kit) uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm to encrypt exploit code and establish an encrypted channel for command and control (C2) operations.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy (Command and Control):** This technique involves the use of proxy servers to route C2 traffic through intermediate systems, making it harder to trace the origin of the traffic.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography (Command and Control):** This technique involves the use of symmetric encryption (like RC4) to protect the confidentiality of C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique is directly relevant to the question as it describes the use of proxy servers to obfuscate the C2 traffic, which aligns with the goal of making infections harder to detect.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique is also relevant as it describes the use of symmetric encryption (RC4 in this case) to protect the C2 communications, which is already mentioned in the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of symmetric encryption (RC4) is already established in the question to protect the C2 communications.
   - To further enhance the stealth and resilience of the C2 infrastructure, it is common for advanced threat actors to use proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) to route their traffic through multiple intermediate points.
   - This additional layer of obfuscation makes it more difficult for defenders to trace the C2 traffic back to its origin, thereby making the infections harder to detect.
