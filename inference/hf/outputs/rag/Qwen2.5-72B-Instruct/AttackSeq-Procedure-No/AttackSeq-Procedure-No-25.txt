### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Machete malware:
     - Collecting data (clipboard contents, screenshots, keystrokes).
     - Exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers.
     - Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with command and control (C2) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which could be encrypted or unencrypted.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Clipboard Data (T1115):**
     - This technique is clearly mentioned in the question and is part of the collection phase.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - This technique suggests that data is exfiltrated over a C2 channel, which could be encrypted. This aligns with the part of the question that mentions exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers.
   - **Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003):**
     - This technique suggests that data is exfiltrated over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication. This does not align with the part of the question that mentions using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C2 servers, as these are common C2 protocols.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question mentions exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers and using FTP and HTTP ports for C2 communication. The T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) aligns well with this, as it can involve encrypted data and C2 communication over common protocols like HTTP.
   - The T1048.003 technique (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol) does not align with the use of FTP and HTTP for C2 communication, as these are typically C2 protocols.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
