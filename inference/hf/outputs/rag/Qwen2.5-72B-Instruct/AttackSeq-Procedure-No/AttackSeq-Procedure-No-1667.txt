### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TDrop2 malware, after using process hollowing and obfuscating its second-stage payload, will communicate with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands only before executing commands to collect TCP connections during its discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or payloads to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the malware.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less recognizable to defenders.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Hollowing and Obfuscation:**
     - TDrop2 uses process hollowing to inject its code into a legitimate process, which is a common technique for defense evasion.
     - The second-stage payload is obfuscated, which aligns with the T1027.013 technique (Encrypted/Encoded File) and T1001 (Data Obfuscation).

   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The question specifies that the communication with C2 servers is encrypted and encoded. This aligns with the T1027.013 technique (Encrypted/Encoded File) and T1001 (Data Obfuscation).
     - The use of multi-stage channels (T1104) suggests that the communication might involve multiple steps, which could include encrypted and encoded commands.

   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The question mentions that the malware will execute commands to collect TCP connections during its discovery activities. This is a common tactic for gathering information about the network and system, which is part of the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs support the idea that TDrop2 malware will use encrypted and encoded commands for communication with C2 servers. The techniques T1027.013 and T1001 specifically mention encryption and encoding, which align with the question's description.
   - The multi-stage channels (T1104) further support the idea of a complex communication process, which could include encrypted and encoded commands.
