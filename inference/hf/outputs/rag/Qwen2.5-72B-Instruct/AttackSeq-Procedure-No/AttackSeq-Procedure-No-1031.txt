### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after using direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features for lateral movement, attackers are likely to use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which can be done using tools like ADFind and port scanning.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool:** This technique involves acquiring or creating tools to support operations, which can include tools like ADFind and port scanning tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - After achieving lateral movement using tools like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh, it is common for attackers to gather more information about the network and Active Directory to understand the environment better and plan further actions.
     - The related TTPs (T1018 and T1588.002) support this sequence. T1018 involves discovering remote systems, and T1588.002 involves acquiring tools that can be used for such discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that attackers would not use tools like ADFind and port scanning after lateral movement, which is less likely given the typical attack patterns and the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information after achieving lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
