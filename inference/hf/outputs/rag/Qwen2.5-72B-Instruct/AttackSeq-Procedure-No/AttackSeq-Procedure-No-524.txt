### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that a COM object will be used to execute queries to gather system information before a PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique involves using HTML smuggling to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved by delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This is a common method for delivering malware.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - Using a COM object to gather system information is a plausible step in the attack sequence. COM objects can be used to interact with the operating system and gather various types of information.
   - **PowerShell Script:**
     - The PowerShell script is used to download a zip file containing components for the malware payload. This is a common technique for downloading and executing additional malware components.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker delivers a malicious document to gain a foothold on the system.
     2. **Gathering System Information:** The attacker uses a COM object to gather system information, which can help in determining the environment and planning further actions.
     3. **Downloading Malware Components:** The attacker uses a PowerShell script to download additional components, which can include the main payload or other tools.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common use of COM objects for gathering system information before downloading additional components, the answer is:
     **Final Answer: A: Yes**
