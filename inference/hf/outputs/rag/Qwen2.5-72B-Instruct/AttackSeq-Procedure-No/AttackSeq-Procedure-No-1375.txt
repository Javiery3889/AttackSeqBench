### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - A malicious document creates a batch file.
     - A registry entry is created to ensure persistence.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the document will then use DDE via PowerShell to download and run encoded commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or launch applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell (T1059.001):**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute commands, including encoded commands.
   - **Dynamic Data Exchange (T1559.002):**
     - DDE is a technique that can be used to execute commands or launch applications, often in the context of Office documents.
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The document has already created a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.
     - It is common for APT groups to use multiple techniques to achieve their goals, including combining DDE and PowerShell.
     - DDE can be used to trigger the execution of PowerShell scripts, which can then download and run encoded commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common practices of APT groups, it is plausible that the document would use DDE to trigger PowerShell, which would then download and run encoded commands.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
