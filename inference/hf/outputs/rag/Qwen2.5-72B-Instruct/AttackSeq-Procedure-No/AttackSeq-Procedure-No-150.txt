### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets before gaining initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.
   - **T1189 - Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website that the target is likely to visit, often through a watering hole attack, to deliver a payload or exploit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits, it would align with the T1189 technique (Drive-by Compromise). This method involves compromising a website that the target frequently visits, which can be a plausible initial access vector.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If TG1021 did not use watering hole attacks, it would mean they directly exploited the public-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability, which aligns with the T1190 technique (Exploit Public-Facing Application).

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where TG1021 first used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits. This aligns with the T1189 technique (Drive-by Compromise).
   - However, the question also mentions that they gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability, which aligns with the T1190 technique (Exploit Public-Facing Application).
   - Given the context, it is more likely that TG1021 used the T1190 technique directly, as it is a more direct and efficient method for gaining initial access to the target's network.

### Final Answer: B: No
