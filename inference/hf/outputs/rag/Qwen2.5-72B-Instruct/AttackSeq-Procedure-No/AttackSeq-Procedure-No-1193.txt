### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions performed by ComboJack, specifically whether it will enter an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information only after ensuring persistence and hiding itself.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which is relevant to the part of the question about checking clipboard contents for wallet information.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves setting a registry key or placing a file in a startup folder to ensure the malware runs at system startup, which is relevant to the part of the question about ensuring persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001):** Ensuring persistence by setting a registry key is a common initial step for malware to maintain access to the system.
   - **Hiding (attrib.exe):** Using `attrib.exe` to hide the malware is another common step to avoid detection.
   - **Clipboard Monitoring (T1115):** Monitoring the clipboard for wallet information is a subsequent step that would typically occur after the malware has established persistence and hidden itself to avoid detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (ensuring persistence, hiding itself, and then entering an infinite loop to check clipboard contents) aligns with the typical behavior of malware like ComboJack.
   - Ensuring persistence and hiding the malware are logical first steps to maintain access and avoid detection.
   - Monitoring the clipboard for wallet information is a subsequent step that would be performed after these initial steps.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. Typically, ComboJack would ensure persistence and hide itself before entering an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information. Therefore, the answer is "No."
