### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the GreyEnergy group:
     - Compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
     - Using Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.
     - The question then asks if the group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which aligns with using Nmap to map the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to remote systems to facilitate movement within the network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute code on remote systems, which could include using PDQ Deploy.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The use of PDQ Deploy aligns with the T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) and T1072 (Software Deployment Tools) techniques.
       - PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool that can be used to execute code on remote systems, making it a plausible method for lateral movement and tool deployment.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the GreyEnergy group will not use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While this is a possible scenario, it does not align as well with the related TTPs, which suggest the use of software deployment tools for lateral movement and tool transfer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
