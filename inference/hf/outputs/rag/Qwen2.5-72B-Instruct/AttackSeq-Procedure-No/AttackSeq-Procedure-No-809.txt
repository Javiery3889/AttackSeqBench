### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer is likely to discover data from SNS (Social Networking Service) applications only before executing by reading its configuration file from `C:\ProgramData` and loading a DLL module into memory.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Categorizing collected data into different directories as ".a" files.
     - Discovering data from SNS applications.
     - Reading a configuration file from `C:\ProgramData`.
     - Loading a DLL module into memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves the use of automated tools to collect data from various sources.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory information on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that WinDealer specifically targets SNS applications for data discovery before executing the other steps.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that WinDealer does not specifically target SNS applications for data discovery before executing the other steps.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1119-Automated Collection** suggests that WinDealer uses automated tools to collect data, but it does not specify that the data is exclusively from SNS applications.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** indicates that WinDealer discovers file and directory information, which is a broader activity and not limited to SNS applications.
   - The question mentions that WinDealer categorizes collected data into different directories as ".a" files, which suggests a more general data collection process rather than a specific focus on SNS applications.
   - The steps of reading a configuration file from `C:\ProgramData` and loading a DLL module into memory are typical for malware to execute its payload, but they do not indicate a specific focus on SNS applications.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
