### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Tortoiseshell conducted pre-compromise web searches for victim information.
   - The sequence of events mentioned is:
     - Tortoiseshell executed the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' to perform discovery.
     - Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:**
     - This technique involves checking the victim's internet connection status, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:**
     - This technique involves gathering credentials, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying software installed on the victim's system, which is also part of the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):**
     - This technique is specifically about gathering credentials, which is a form of pre-compromise information gathering.
   - **Discovery (T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery and T1518-Software Discovery):**
     - These techniques are about discovering information about the victim's system after gaining some level of access, which is post-compromise.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question asks about pre-compromise activities, specifically web searches for victim information.
   - The related TTPs include a reconnaissance technique (T1589.001-Credentials) that involves gathering information before the attack.
   - The discovery techniques (T1016.001 and T1518) are more relevant to post-compromise activities.
   - Given that Tortoiseshell executed a reconnaissance tool and later gained initial access, it is logical to assume that they conducted pre-compromise web searches to gather information about the victims.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
