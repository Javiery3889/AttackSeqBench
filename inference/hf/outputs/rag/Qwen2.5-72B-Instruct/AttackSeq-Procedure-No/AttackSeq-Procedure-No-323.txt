### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware uses a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware will collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding methods (like Base64) to obfuscate command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware gathering system information, such as the operating system version, username, and system name.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware identifying file and directory paths on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix:**
     - This is a method used to obfuscate communication with the C2 server, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase involves the malware gathering information about the system and its environment.
     - The related TTPs T1082 and T1083 are both part of the Discovery phase and involve gathering system information and file/directory paths.
   - **Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data:**
     - While T1082 and T1083 are focused on system and file information, they do not explicitly mention collecting text messages, contact lists, or geo-location data.
     - However, these types of data are often collected during the Discovery phase to understand the victim's environment and to plan further actions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs T1082 and T1083 are part of the Discovery phase and involve gathering system and file information.
   - While they do not explicitly mention text messages, contact lists, or geo-location data, it is common for malware to collect such information during the Discovery phase to gain a comprehensive understanding of the victim's environment.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware will collect this information as part of its broader Discovery activities.
