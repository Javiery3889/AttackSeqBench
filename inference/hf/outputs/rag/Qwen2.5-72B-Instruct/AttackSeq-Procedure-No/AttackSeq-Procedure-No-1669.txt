### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TDrop2 malware is likely to perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using standard encoding methods to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard encoding methods to obfuscate C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries collecting information about the system and network to aid in further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that TDrop2 malware is using a custom base64 alphabet, which aligns with the **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** technique.
   - After establishing C2 communication, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities to gather information about the system and network. This aligns with the **T1082-System Information Discovery** technique.
   - The sequence described in the question (C2 communication followed by discovery activities) is a typical attack pattern where the malware first establishes a communication channel and then gathers information to plan further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack activities, it is likely that TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after communicating with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
