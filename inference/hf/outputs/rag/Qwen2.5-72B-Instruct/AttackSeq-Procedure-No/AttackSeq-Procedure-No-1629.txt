### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will use scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers, after gaining access through compromised remote services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves gaining initial access to the network through compromised remote services like VPN or Citrix.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code, such as the Cobalt Strike beacon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary gains initial access to the network through compromised remote services (T1133-External Remote Services).
   - **Persistence:** After gaining access, the adversary will likely seek to establish persistence to ensure they can maintain access over time. One common method for achieving persistence is by using scheduled tasks (T1053.005-Scheduled Task).
   - **Execution:** Once persistence is established, the adversary can use scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon. This ensures that the beacon is regularly active and can be used to maintain control over the system.
   - **Targeting High Uptime Systems:** Servers and other systems with high uptimes are often targeted for persistence because they are less likely to be rebooted frequently, making them ideal for maintaining long-term access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the context provided, it is indeed likely that the adversary will use scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
