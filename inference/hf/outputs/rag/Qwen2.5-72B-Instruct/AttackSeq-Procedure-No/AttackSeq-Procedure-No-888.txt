### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor is likely to parse and extract information from Pulse Secure Connect logs as part of its discovery activities after establishing persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is used to maintain persistence by adding a program to the 'Run' registry key or the 'Startup' folder.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This is the same technique as above, reinforcing the method of persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering file and directory paths on the system, which is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The Aria-body loader uses the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key to establish persistence. This is a common method for ensuring that the backdoor is executed every time the system starts.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - After establishing persistence, the next logical step in an attack sequence is to perform discovery activities to understand the environment. This includes identifying files, directories, and other system information.
   - **Parsing Pulse Secure Connect Logs:**
     - Parsing and extracting information from specific logs, such as Pulse Secure Connect logs, is a more targeted discovery activity. It is likely that the backdoor would perform this action to gather specific information about the network and user activities.
   - **High-Level Collection:**
     - High-level collection activities, such as file searching and metadata gathering, typically follow the initial discovery phase. These activities are more extensive and involve collecting a broader range of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, it is plausible that the Aria-body backdoor would parse and extract information from Pulse Secure Connect logs as part of its discovery activities before moving on to high-level collection tasks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
