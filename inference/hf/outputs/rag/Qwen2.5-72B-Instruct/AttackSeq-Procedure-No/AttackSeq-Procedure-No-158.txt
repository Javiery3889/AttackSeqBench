### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10, after gaining initial access through spear phishing, is likely to extract Wi-Fi network names and perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks before leveraging shared MSP (Managed Service Provider) infrastructure for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002 - Wi-Fi Discovery:** This technique involves an adversary discovering all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks, which can be used to understand the network environment and potentially target other devices.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment):** This is a common initial access technique used by APT10 to gain a foothold in the victim's network.
   - **Discovery (T1016.002 - Wi-Fi Discovery):** After gaining initial access, APT10 might use this technique to discover locally reachable Wi-Fi networks. However, the question specifically asks if APT10 is likely to perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks.
   - **Brute-Force Attack:** While Wi-Fi discovery can help identify potential targets, performing a brute-force attack to spread to new networks is not a typical next step for APT10. APT10 is known for more sophisticated and stealthy methods of lateral movement, such as leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.
   - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:** APT10 is known to use shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between different victims. This is a more common and effective method for APT10 to spread within a network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of APT10 and the related TTPs, it is less likely that APT10 would perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks after discovering Wi-Fi networks. Instead, they are more likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: No**
