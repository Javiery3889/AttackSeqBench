### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a zero-day exploit in a Word document is used to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying security software and tools installed on the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves monitoring user activity to understand the environment and avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory structures on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.
     - The related TTPs (T1518.001, T1497.002, T1083) all fall under the Discovery tactic, which aligns with the idea of performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
     - It is common for malware to perform discovery actions to understand the environment and avoid detection before proceeding with further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Longhorn's tools will not perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that discovery actions are a crucial part of the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in malware operations, it is more plausible that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
