### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords after collecting Instagram credentials through phishing sites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials, which aligns with the initial step of collecting Instagram credentials through phishing.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves using email accounts, which could be relevant if the attackers are using email to phish for Instagram credentials.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop:** This technique involves stopping specific services, which could be relevant if the attackers are stopping backup services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before changing the passwords.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - After collecting credentials, attackers might want to ensure that the victims cannot recover their accounts easily. Stopping backup services would prevent the victims from restoring their accounts from backups.
       - The T1489-Service Stop technique aligns with this step, as it involves stopping services that could be used for recovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not stop specific services related to backups before changing the passwords.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice implies that the attackers are only interested in changing the passwords and not in preventing recovery through other means.
       - However, given the T1489-Service Stop technique, it is more likely that the attackers would take additional steps to ensure the victims cannot regain access to their accounts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions an attacker might take, the most plausible answer is that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before changing the passwords.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
