### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious macro in an MS Office document downloads the RMS tool and supporting scripts.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the threat actors will achieve persistence by using the `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command in MS-SQL to create a link between a created account and other servers in the network before attempting to kill the `rundll32.exe` process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves manipulating accounts to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using a scheduled task for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors will use the `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command to create a link between a created account and other servers in the network before attempting to kill the `rundll32.exe` process.
     - The `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command is used to create a linked server login, which is a method of account manipulation. This aligns with the T1098 technique.
     - However, the question also mentions killing the `rundll32.exe` process, which is not directly related to persistence or account manipulation. It is more related to process manipulation or defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors will not use the `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command in the described sequence.
     - Given the related TTPs, the focus is on persistence and account manipulation, but the sequence described in the question (creating a linked server login and then killing `rundll32.exe`) seems less likely to be a direct part of the persistence strategy.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs focus on persistence and account manipulation, which align with the use of `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` for creating a linked server login.
   - However, the sequence described in the question (creating a linked server login and then killing `rundll32.exe`) is not a typical or logical sequence for achieving persistence.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the threat actors will follow this specific sequence.

### Final Answer: B: No
