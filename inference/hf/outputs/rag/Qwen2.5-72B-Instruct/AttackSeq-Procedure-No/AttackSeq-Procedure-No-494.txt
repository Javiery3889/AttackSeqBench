### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Injecting a .NET C2 client into memory.
     - Executing the Jupyter infostealer using PowerShell scripts.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the Jupyter infostealer will use steganography for C2 communications, sending collected information, and version upgrades.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:**
     - This technique involves using steganography to hide C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography:**
     - This technique involves using steganography to evade detection by hiding malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Steganography in C2 Communications:**
     - T1001.002 (Steganography in C2) is directly related to hiding C2 communications, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by network security systems.
   - **Steganography in Defense Evasion:**
     - T1027.003 (Steganography in Defense Evasion) is used to hide malicious content, which can include the infostealer itself or the data it collects.
   - **Sending Collected Information:**
     - Steganography can be used to hide the collected information within seemingly benign files or network traffic, making it less likely to be detected by security systems.
   - **Version Upgrades:**
     - Steganography can also be used to hide the new versions of the infostealer or other malicious components during the upgrade process.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Jupyter infostealer would use steganography for C2 communications, sending collected information, and undergoing version upgrades. Both T1001.002 and T1027.003 support the use of steganography in these contexts.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
