### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware, after collecting and uploading information to Dropbox, will use steganography to hide its C2 (Command and Control) communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002 - Steganography:**
     - This technique involves using steganography to hide C2 communications within other files or data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data to a remote location, such as uploading to Dropbox.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will use steganography to hide its C2 communications.
     - The related TTP T1001.002 (Steganography) is directly relevant to this choice, indicating that steganography is a known technique for hiding C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use steganography to hide its C2 communications.
     - While the malware is using Dropbox for exfiltration (T1020), this does not necessarily preclude the use of steganography for C2 communications.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The presence of T1001.002 (Steganography) in the related TTPs strongly suggests that steganography is a plausible technique for hiding C2 communications.
   - The fact that the malware is already using Dropbox for exfiltration (T1020) does not contradict the use of steganography for C2, as these are different stages of the attack lifecycle.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware could use steganography to hide its C2 communications.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
