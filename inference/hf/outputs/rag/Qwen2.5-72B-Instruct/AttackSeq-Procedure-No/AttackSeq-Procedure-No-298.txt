### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aurora malware:
     - Modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
     - Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.
     - Communicating to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 (Command and Control).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):**
     - This technique involves modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL to evade detection.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication (Command and Control):**
     - This technique involves establishing a communication channel that allows the malware to send and receive data from the C2 server.
   - **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols (Command and Control):**
     - This technique involves using protocols like Jabber/XMPP for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Aurora malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols** specifically mentions the use of Jabber/XMPP for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Aurora malware will not communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.
     - This choice is not supported by the related TTPs, which indicate that Jabber/XMPP is a valid C2 protocol.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Aurora malware will indeed communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
