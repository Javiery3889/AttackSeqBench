### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems only after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, and after using Mimikatz to dump credentials for further network access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. In this case, the vulnerability is CVE-2019-0604 in Microsoft SharePoint.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The first step in the attack sequence is gaining initial access to the network. This is achieved by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells.
   - **Credential Dumping:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker uses Mimikatz to dump credentials. This is a common technique to obtain additional credentials for further network access.
   - **Network Reconnaissance:**
     - Network reconnaissance is typically performed to identify vulnerable systems and understand the network topology. This step is crucial for the attacker to plan further actions and identify potential targets for exploitation.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Exploit CVE-2019-0604 in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells (Initial Access).
     2. Use Mimikatz to dump credentials (Credential Access).
     3. Perform network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems (Discovery).

   - This sequence is logical and aligns with common attack patterns. After gaining initial access and obtaining credentials, the next logical step is to perform network reconnaissance to identify further targets.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, the answer is that it is likely that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems after exploiting the vulnerability and dumping credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
