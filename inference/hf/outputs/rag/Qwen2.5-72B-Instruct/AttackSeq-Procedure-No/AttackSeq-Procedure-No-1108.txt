### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for Command and Control (C2) after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
   - This technique indicates that data exfiltration can occur over the same channel used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will use the same channel for both C2 and data exfiltration.
     - Given the related TTP (T1041), this is a plausible scenario. Many malware families, including CosmicDuke, often use the same channel for both C2 and exfiltration to reduce the number of network connections and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will use a different channel for data exfiltration.
     - While it is possible for malware to use different channels, the related TTP (T1041) specifically mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel, making this choice less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP (T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
