### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - An obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`).
     - The njRAT malware establishes command and control (C2) over the victim's computer.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that actions to maintain persistence will be performed after these steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used for various malicious activities, including initial execution, persistence, and C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Execution:**
     - The obfuscated batch script is used to execute the PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`). This is a common method for initial execution of malware.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - njRAT is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that establishes C2 communication with the attacker. Once C2 is established, the attacker can issue commands to the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access and establishing C2, it is common for attackers to perform actions to maintain persistence. This ensures that they can maintain access to the victim's system even if the initial entry point is closed or the system is rebooted.
     - Common persistence techniques include:
       - Creating scheduled tasks.
       - Modifying registry keys.
       - Adding startup entries.
       - Using legitimate Windows services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described (initial execution and C2 establishment), it is highly likely that the attacker will perform actions to maintain persistence to ensure continued access to the victim's system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
