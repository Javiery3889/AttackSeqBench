### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13 after collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.
   - It specifically asks if FIN13 will use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the destruction of data, which is not directly relevant to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI for execution, which is relevant to the use of Invoke-WMIExec for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement via Remote Services:**
     - The use of Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement is a common technique used by advanced threat actors, including FIN13. This aligns with the T1047 technique.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining access to additional systems through lateral movement, it is typical for attackers to perform internal reconnaissance to gather more information about the network and systems. This often involves the use of native OS binaries and custom malware.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (lateral movement followed by internal reconnaissance) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks. FIN13, being a sophisticated threat actor, is likely to follow such a sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the known behavior of FIN13.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
