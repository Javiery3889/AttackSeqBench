### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities performed by the Machete malware:
     - Enumeration of running processes.
     - Gathering browser data (bookmarks and stored credentials).
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware will deploy a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1040 - Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information, which can include user credentials.
   - **T1217 - Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information from web browsers, such as bookmarks and stored credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1217 - Browser Information Discovery:** This technique aligns with the described activity of gathering browser data (bookmarks and stored credentials).
   - **T1040 - Network Sniffing:** This technique is relevant to the question of whether the malware will deploy a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already gathered browser data, which includes stored credentials. This suggests that the malware is interested in credentials.
   - Deploying a network sniffer module (T1040) to capture credentials being sent over the network is a logical next step in the attack sequence, as it can provide additional credentials that may not be stored in the browser.
   - The sequence of activities (discovery of running processes, gathering browser data, and then network sniffing) is consistent with a multi-stage attack where the malware progressively gathers more information to achieve its objectives.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
