### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Derusbi, after using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection, is likely to retrieve metadata for files on disk or list the current working directory before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to evade detection. In this context, binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server fits this description.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries attempting to get information about file and directory paths on a system. This could include listing the current working directory or retrieving metadata for files on disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Step 1: Evade Detection:**
       - Derusbi uses the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table, which helps in evading detection.
     - **Step 2: Discovery:**
       - After evading detection, it is logical for the malware to gather information about the system, such as file and directory metadata, to understand the environment better.
     - **Step 3: Command and Control:**
       - Once the necessary information is gathered, the malware would then bind to a raw socket and initiate communication with the C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is likely that Derusbi will retrieve metadata for files on disk or list the current working directory before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
