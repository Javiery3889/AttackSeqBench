### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the StellarParticle campaign is likely to generate repeated MFA requests to access victim accounts before using web session cookies in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Credential hopping
     - Configuring malware (TrailBlazer) for WMI persistence
     - Generating repeated MFA requests
     - Using web session cookies for credential access

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique involves using web session cookies to maintain access to a web application or service.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**
     - This technique involves generating multiple MFA requests to bypass or overwhelm MFA mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique involves using web session cookies to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Hopping and WMI Persistence:**
     - Credential hopping involves using compromised credentials to move laterally within a network.
     - Configuring malware for WMI persistence ensures that the malware remains active and can be reactivated after system reboots.
   - **Generating Repeated MFA Requests:**
     - Generating repeated MFA requests is a technique used to overwhelm or bypass MFA mechanisms, which can be a part of the credential access phase.
   - **Using Web Session Cookies:**
     - Using web session cookies is a technique to maintain access to web applications or services, which can be used for both credential access and lateral movement.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     - Credential hopping and WMI persistence (initial access and persistence)
     - Generating repeated MFA requests (credential access)
     - Using web session cookies (credential access and lateral movement)
   - The related TTPs support the use of web session cookies and MFA request generation, which are both relevant to the credential access and lateral movement phases.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - Generating repeated MFA requests can be a step in the credential access phase to bypass MFA, and using web session cookies can be a subsequent step to maintain access and move laterally.
