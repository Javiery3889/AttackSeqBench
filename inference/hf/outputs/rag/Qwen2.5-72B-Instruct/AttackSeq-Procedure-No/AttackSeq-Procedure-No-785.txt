### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence involves using an LNK file to execute a JavaScript file.
   - The JavaScript file is part of the execution phase.
   - The question asks if the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts (LNK files) to execute malicious code when the shortcut is accessed.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique is listed again, emphasizing the use of scheduled tasks for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
     - This implies a specific order of operations: first, adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks, and then copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the JavaScript file will not follow the specific order described in Choice A.
     - This implies that the actions of adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks and copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory can occur in any order or independently.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that both scheduled tasks and shortcut modifications are used for persistence.
   - The question specifies a particular order of operations, but the TTPs do not provide a clear indication that one must occur before the other.
   - In typical attack scenarios, attackers may use multiple persistence techniques in parallel or in any order to ensure redundancy and increase the likelihood of maintaining access.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the actions of adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks and copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory can occur independently or in any order.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
