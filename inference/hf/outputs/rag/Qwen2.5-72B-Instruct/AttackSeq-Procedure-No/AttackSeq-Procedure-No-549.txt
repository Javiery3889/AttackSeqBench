### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BADBOX malware will use a backdoor connection to a C2 server only before exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.
   - The key points are:
     - Injecting additional modules into device memory.
     - Using a backdoor connection to a C2 server.
     - Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:**
     - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain to introduce backdoors or malicious components into devices.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel with a C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Injecting additional modules into device memory:**
     - This is a common post-exploitation technique to enhance the capabilities of the malware.
   - **Using a backdoor connection to a C2 server:**
     - This is a command and control (C2) technique (T1102.002) to maintain control over the compromised device.
   - **Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors:**
     - This is an initial access technique (T1195.003) to compromise hardware supply chains.

   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the backdoor connection to the C2 server is used only before exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities. However, the related TTPs indicate that the C2 communication (T1102.002) is a separate and ongoing process, not necessarily limited to a specific phase before supply chain exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible based on the related TTPs. The C2 communication is typically an ongoing process that can occur at various stages of the attack, not just before supply chain exploitation.

**Final Answer: B: No**
