### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers:
     - Established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control (C2) server.
     - Used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover the internal network.
     - Collected administrative level credentials.
     - Compromised additional network endpoints.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers escalated privileges by compromising a Domain Administrator account only after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain higher-level privileges, such as those of a Domain Administrator.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The attackers used a backdoor from the C2 server to establish persistence. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Using Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - The Cobalt Strike beacon is a powerful tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement within a network. It can be used to discover the internal network and collect information.
   - **Collecting Administrative Level Credentials:**
     - Collecting administrative level credentials is a crucial step in gaining deeper access to the network. This can be done through various methods, such as credential dumping or phishing.
   - **Compromising Additional Network Endpoints:**
     - Once administrative credentials are obtained, attackers can use them to compromise additional network endpoints, expanding their control over the network.
   - **Escalating Privileges:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers escalated privileges by compromising a Domain Administrator account only after these actions. Given the sequence described, it is plausible that the attackers would have already collected administrative credentials, which could include Domain Administrator credentials, during the earlier steps.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers would have already collected Domain Administrator credentials during the process of collecting administrative level credentials and compromising additional network endpoints. Therefore, it is not likely that they would escalate privileges by compromising a Domain Administrator account only afterward.

**Final Answer: B: No**
