### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor, after gathering system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase, is likely to set up Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning for capturing victim credentials or planting espionage-oriented malware as part of the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and other network-related details.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.004-Evil Twin:**
     - This technique involves setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one to trick victims into connecting and then capturing their credentials or delivering malware.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.004-Evil Twin:**
     - This technique is also listed under the Collection tactic, indicating that it can be used to collect data, such as credentials, from victims.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor has already gathered detailed system information, hostname, and public IP. This aligns with the T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery technique, which is part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question asks if the backdoor is likely to set up Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning as part of the Collection phase. The T1557.004-Evil Twin technique is listed under both the Credential Access and Collection tactics, indicating that it can be used for both capturing credentials and collecting data.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the backdoor has already gathered network configuration details, it is plausible that it could use this information to set up an Evil Twin Wi-Fi access point. This would allow the attacker to capture victim credentials or plant espionage-oriented malware, which aligns with the Collection phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely answer is that the Aria-body backdoor would set up Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning as part of the Collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
