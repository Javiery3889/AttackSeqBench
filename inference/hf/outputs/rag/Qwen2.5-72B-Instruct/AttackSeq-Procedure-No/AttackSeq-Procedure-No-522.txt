### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The attack starts with exploiting CVE-2017-0199 using Microsoft Word documents for initial access.
   - It then asks if the attack likely employed a worm infection strategy using a removable device to breach a secure network environment.
   - Finally, it asks if the attack achieved persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of CVE-2017-0199 in Microsoft Word documents aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique. This is a plausible and well-documented method for initial access.
   - **Worm Infection Strategy:**
     - The question mentions a worm infection strategy using a removable device. While this is a known method for spreading malware, it is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a common technique for lateral movement and breaching secure network environments.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The scheduling of a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique. This is a common method for achieving persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The initial access and persistence techniques are well-supported by the related TTPs.
   - The worm infection strategy using a removable device, while not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, is a plausible method for breaching a secure network environment and is a known TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns, including initial access through exploitation, lateral movement using a worm infection strategy, and achieving persistence through scheduled tasks.
