### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will exploit zero-day vulnerabilities for initial access before gaining initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.004-Exploits:** This technique involves developing or acquiring exploits to use in future operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to victims when they visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (T1190):** Zero-day vulnerabilities are unknown to the public and the software vendors, making them highly valuable and often used for targeted attacks. However, they are also rare and typically reserved for high-value targets.
   - **Delivering Malware Disguised as Legitimate Software Updates (T1189):** This technique is more common and less resource-intensive. It involves tricking users into downloading and installing malware by masquerading it as a legitimate software update.

4. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - **Darkhotel APT:** Darkhotel is known for targeting high-profile individuals, such as executives and government officials, often using sophisticated techniques. However, they are also known to use more common methods to gain initial access, such as social engineering and drive-by compromises.
   - **Reconnaissance:** The question mentions that Darkhotel performs reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans. This suggests a targeted approach, but it does not necessarily imply the use of zero-day vulnerabilities.

5. **Plausibility:**
   - Given the high value and rarity of zero-day vulnerabilities, it is less likely that Darkhotel would use them as a primary method for initial access. Instead, they are more likely to use more common and less detectable methods, such as delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates, especially after performing detailed reconnaissance.
