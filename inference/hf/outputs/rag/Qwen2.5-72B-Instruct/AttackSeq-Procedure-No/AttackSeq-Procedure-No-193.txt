### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Elise malware will enumerate running processes (discovery phase) only after distributing a malicious Microsoft Word document to facilitate initial access, given that it has already achieved persistence through the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves the malware enumerating running processes to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves the malware achieving persistence by adding a registry key or startup folder entry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):** The malware has already achieved persistence by adding a registry key with the value name IAStorD. This means that the malware will run every time the system starts.
   - **Discovery (T1057-Process Discovery):** The question asks if the malware will enumerate running processes only after distributing a malicious Microsoft Word document to facilitate initial access.
   - **Initial Access:** Distributing a malicious Microsoft Word document is a common method for initial access, often through phishing or other social engineering techniques. However, the question states that the malware has already achieved persistence, which implies that initial access has already been established.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     1. The malware achieves initial access through a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     2. The malware achieves persistence by adding a registry key.
     3. The malware then enumerates running processes as part of its discovery phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a specific sequence where the malware enumerates running processes only after distributing a malicious document. However, the related TTPs and the context suggest that the malware has already achieved persistence, which means initial access has already been established.
   - Given that the malware has already achieved persistence, it is likely that the enumeration of running processes (discovery phase) can occur at any point after persistence is established, not necessarily only after the initial access method (malicious document distribution).
