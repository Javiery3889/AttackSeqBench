### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that DNSpionage attackers conducted targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers before using password-protected macros in malicious Microsoft Office documents to evade detection.
   - The key elements are:
     - Resource development (generating Let's Encrypt certificates for redirected domains).
     - Targeted surveillance (against activists and bloggers).
     - Use of password-protected macros in malicious Office documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, such as names, email addresses, and other personal details. This is a common step in targeted attacks to tailor the attack to the specific victim.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, such as password-protected macros in Microsoft Office documents, to gain initial access to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The attackers generated Let's Encrypt certificates for redirected domains, which is a step in setting up the infrastructure for their attack. This is often done to make the fake websites appear more legitimate.
   - **Targeted Surveillance:**
     - The related TTP T1589 (Gather Victim Identity Information) suggests that the attackers likely conducted reconnaissance to gather information about their targets (activists and bloggers). This is a common step in targeted attacks to ensure the spearphishing emails are more convincing.
   - **Use of Password-Protected Macros:**
     - The related TTP T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) indicates that the attackers used spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, such as password-protected macros, to evade detection and gain initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. The attackers likely conducted targeted surveillance to gather information about their victims, which would help them create more convincing spearphishing emails. The use of password-protected macros in malicious Office documents is a common technique to evade detection and gain initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
