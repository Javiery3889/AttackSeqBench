### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - It mentions the use of 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck' for scanning and mapping the internal network.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the campaign will use stolen cookies for pass-the-hash attacks and establish RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying active network connections, which aligns with the use of 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck' for scanning.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves using tunneling to communicate with command and control servers, which aligns with the use of 'POWSSHNET' for RDP connections over SSH.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying network services, which also aligns with the use of 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck' for mapping the internal network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Discovery:**
     - The use of 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck' for scanning and mapping the internal network aligns with the T1049 and T1046 techniques.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using stolen cookies for pass-the-hash attacks. However, pass-the-hash attacks typically involve stealing and reusing NTLM hashes, not cookies. Stolen cookies are more commonly used in web application attacks.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The use of 'POWSSHNET' for RDP connections over SSH tunneling aligns with the T1572 technique for protocol tunneling.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The initial discovery and command and control techniques are well-supported by the related TTPs.
   - However, the use of stolen cookies for pass-the-hash attacks is not a typical sequence and seems out of place in the context of the described TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The sequence described in the question, particularly the use of stolen cookies for pass-the-hash attacks, does not align well with the typical TTPs associated with the Fox Kitten Campaign and the related TTPs provided.
