### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, the threat actor SWEED will proceed to collect data from the local system before employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code. In this case, CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, credentials, and other sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The threat actor first exploits CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access and execute code on the target system.
     - **Data Collection (T1005):** After gaining access, it is common for threat actors to collect data from the local system to gather information that can be exfiltrated or used for further attacks.
     - **Defense Evasion (T1070.004):** Once the data is collected, the threat actor may employ defense evasion techniques to cover their tracks, such as deleting the original file to remove evidence of the exploit.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question (exploitation, data collection, defense evasion) is a common and logical sequence in cyber attacks. Threat actors often follow this pattern to ensure they can maintain access, gather valuable data, and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
