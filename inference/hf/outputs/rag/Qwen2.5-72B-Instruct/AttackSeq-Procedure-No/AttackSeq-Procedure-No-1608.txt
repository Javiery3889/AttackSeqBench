### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) servers to establish initial access to victim systems before targeting Kavach, a multi-factor authentication (MFA) app.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1552.004 - Private Keys:** This technique involves the adversary obtaining private keys, which are used for encryption and decryption.
   - **T1556.006 - Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves the adversary targeting MFA to gain access to systems.
   - **T1111 - Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique involves intercepting MFA tokens or codes to bypass MFA.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If SideCopy is targeting Kavach, an MFA app, it is plausible that they would gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access. This aligns with the T1552.004 (Private Keys) technique, as gathering private keys can help in decrypting data or gaining access to systems.
     - Additionally, T1556.006 (Multi-Factor Authentication) and T1111 (Multi-Factor Authentication Interception) suggest that the adversary is interested in bypassing MFA, which is consistent with targeting an MFA app like Kavach.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy would not gather encryption keys from Azure AD services. However, this does not align well with the related TTPs, which indicate that gathering private keys and targeting MFA are relevant techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SideCopy would gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access before targeting Kavach.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
