### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would use OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails to gain initial access, followed by a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves using spear phishing emails with links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access through OLE2 Format Documents:**
     - OLE2 (Object Linking and Embedding) format documents can contain embedded objects, such as links or macros, which can be used to execute malicious code when opened.
     - This aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique, where the attackers use spear phishing emails with embedded links.
   - **Microsoft Word Sending a GET Request:**
     - After gaining initial access, attackers often perform reconnaissance to gather information about the target system.
     - One method of reconnaissance is to use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to a remote server, which can inform the attackers about the installed software and other system details.
     - This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access through a spear phishing email.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique for initial access.
   - The use of OLE2 format documents with embedded links in spear phishing emails is a common method to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, it is plausible that the attackers would use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to perform reconnaissance.
