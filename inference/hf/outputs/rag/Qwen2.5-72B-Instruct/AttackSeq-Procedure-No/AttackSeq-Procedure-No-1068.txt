### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the data collected by Yellow Garuda from victims' Telegram accounts are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. This can help in maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection.
   - **T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection. By breaking data into smaller, fixed-size chunks, the exfiltration process can be less noticeable and more difficult to detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the T1030 technique, which involves breaking data into smaller, fixed-size chunks to evade detection. Given that Yellow Garuda is collecting a significant amount of data (messages, media, group memberships, and contact data), it would be logical to use this technique to avoid raising suspicion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the T1030 technique. If the data were not divided into fixed-size chunks, the exfiltration process could be more noticeable and easier to detect, which would be less effective for an advanced threat actor like Yellow Garuda.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data are divided into fixed-size chunks to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
