### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Emissary Panda group.
   - They first scanned the network for systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
   - They then exploited the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, they uploaded tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, to perform execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access**
     - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
   - This TTP indicates that the initial access is gained by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the exploitation of the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is likely.
     - The sequence involves scanning for vulnerabilities, exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access, and then uploading tools and backdoors.
     - This aligns with the TTP T1190, which describes gaining initial access through the exploitation of a public-facing application.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the TTP T1190 and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like Emissary Panda.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of actions described in the question is consistent with the TTP T1190 and the behavior of advanced threat actors.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the sequence of actions is likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
