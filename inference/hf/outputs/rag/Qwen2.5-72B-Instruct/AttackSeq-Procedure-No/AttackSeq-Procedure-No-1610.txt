### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which includes Google Drive.
   - **T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data.
   - **T1567 - Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which can include cloud storage services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that SideCopy would first exfiltrate data to Google Drive and then use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
     - **T1567.002** supports the use of cloud storage for exfiltration, which includes Google Drive.
     - **T1020** supports the use of automated tools for exfiltration, which could include GoLang-based file recon plugins.
     - **T1567** supports exfiltration over web services, which can include cloud storage services.
     - However, the question implies a sequence where Google Drive exfiltration happens before the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins. This sequence is not explicitly supported by the related TTPs, which only indicate that both methods can be used for exfiltration.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that it is not likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data to Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
     - The related TTPs do not provide a specific sequence of exfiltration methods. They only indicate that both cloud storage and automated exfiltration tools can be used.
     - Given the lack of specific sequence information in the TTPs, it is more plausible to assume that the exfiltration methods can be used independently or in any order, rather than in a specific sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
