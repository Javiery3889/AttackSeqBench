### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlueBravo will gather victim system information (username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes) only before employing defense evasion techniques such as DLL search order hijacking.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the DLL search order to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one, which can help the attacker evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** This is a common initial step in many attack sequences. Attackers often gather system information to understand the environment they are operating in, which can help them make informed decisions about subsequent actions.
   - **DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001):** This is a defense evasion technique that is typically used after the attacker has gathered enough information to know how to proceed. It is not a standalone initial step but rather a follow-up action to leverage the gathered information.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - It is highly unlikely that an attacker would gather system information only before employing defense evasion techniques. The process of gathering system information is often part of a broader reconnaissance phase, which can occur at multiple points during an attack.
   - Attackers typically gather system information to understand the environment and plan their next steps, which can include various techniques such as persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion. The information gathered can be used to inform multiple stages of the attack, not just the defense evasion phase.

### Final Answer:
B: No
