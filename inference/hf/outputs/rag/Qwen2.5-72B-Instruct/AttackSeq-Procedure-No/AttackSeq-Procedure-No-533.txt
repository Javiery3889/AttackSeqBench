### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the file-stealer module of the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to upload collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories to collect them.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, credentials, and other sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools or scripts to collect data, which can be more efficient and less detectable.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and mapping file and directory structures on the victim's system to determine what data to collect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If the file-stealer module uploads collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories, it suggests a more targeted and efficient approach. This aligns with the use of automated collection (T1119) and file and directory discovery (T1083) to identify and collect specific files.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the file-stealer module does not upload collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories, it suggests a less targeted and potentially more time-consuming approach. This would be less aligned with the efficient and automated collection techniques described in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the file-stealer module would upload collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories to collect them. This approach aligns with the use of automated and efficient collection methods.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
