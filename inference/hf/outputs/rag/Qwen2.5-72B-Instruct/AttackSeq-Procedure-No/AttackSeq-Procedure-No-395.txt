### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT41, after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails, is likely to conduct reconnaissance activities targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves collecting email addresses for use in phishing campaigns.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using voice-based spear-phishing to gather information or gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing (T1566):** The question states that APT41 uses spear-phishing emails to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1566 technique.
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:**
     - **T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique is about collecting email addresses, which is a form of reconnaissance but not specifically targeting call records or hotel reservation systems.
     - **T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using voice-based spear-phishing, which could be used to gather information, but it is not specific to call records or hotel reservation systems.

4. **Context and Plausibility:**
   - APT41 is known for conducting sophisticated and targeted attacks. After gaining initial access, it is common for advanced threat actors to perform reconnaissance to gather more information about the target environment.
   - Targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems could be part of a broader reconnaissance effort to gather sensitive information or to identify high-value targets within the organization.

### Final Answer:
Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that APT41 would conduct such reconnaissance activities after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
