### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search victim collaboration channels like MS Teams or Slack for sensitive information during the collection phase, after injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves stealing credentials from chat messages.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs suggest that Gamaredon’s malware is capable of and has the intent to access and collect data from messaging applications (T1213.005-Messaging Applications). This aligns with the collection phase of the attack lifecycle.
     - Additionally, the technique T1552.008-Chat Messages indicates that the malware can steal credentials from chat messages, which is a form of sensitive information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the malware does not engage in searching or collecting data from collaboration channels, which contradicts the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of the attack, it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search victim collaboration channels for sensitive information during the collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
