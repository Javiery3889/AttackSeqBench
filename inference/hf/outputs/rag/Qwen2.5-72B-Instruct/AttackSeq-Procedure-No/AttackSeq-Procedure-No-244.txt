### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Iron Tiger malware, after achieving persistence via creating a new service or registry key, is likely to download additional payloads using a command-and-control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to ensure that a malicious program runs every time the system starts up. This is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using C2 channels to download additional tools or payloads onto an infected system. This is often done to expand their capabilities or to perform further actions on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that the malware has already achieved persistence, it is logical that the next step would be to download additional payloads to further compromise the system or to perform more sophisticated attacks. The T1105 technique (Ingress Tool Transfer) directly supports this scenario.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the malware would not download additional payloads after achieving persistence. However, this is less likely because achieving persistence is often just the first step in a broader attack plan. Downloading additional tools is a common follow-up action to leverage the persistent access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical malware attack, the most plausible answer is that the Iron Tiger malware will download additional payloads using a C2 server after achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
