### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TDrop2, after gaining initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables, would likely engage in discovery activities (gathering system information and network views) before performing execution using process hollowing to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering security software on the system to understand the environment and potentially evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique involves the malware injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the use of phishing emails to gain initial access to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing):** The malware gains initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Discovery (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery):** After gaining initial access, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities to understand the environment. This includes gathering system information and network views to identify potential targets and security measures.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1055.012-Process Hollowing):** Once the malware has a better understanding of the environment, it may use process hollowing to inject code into a legitimate process, thereby evading detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is likely that TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities before performing execution using process hollowing to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
