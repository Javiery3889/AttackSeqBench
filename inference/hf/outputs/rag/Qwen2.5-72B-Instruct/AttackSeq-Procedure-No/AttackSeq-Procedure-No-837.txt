### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear) is likely to use tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE before executing the exploit documents delivered via spear-phishing campaigns.
   - The focus is on the sequence of actions: spear-phishing to gain initial access, followed by the use of specific tools, and then the exploitation and installation of malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Campaigns:**
     - APT28 is known for using spear-phishing campaigns to deliver exploit documents. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Use of Tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE):**
     - These tools are typically used for post-exploitation activities, such as maintaining persistence, exfiltrating data, or executing additional payloads. They are not typically used before the initial exploitation.
   - **Exploitation and Malware Installation:**
     - After gaining initial access through the spear-phishing campaign, APT28 would likely use the exploit documents to exploit vulnerabilities and install malware like GAMEFISH. This is a logical sequence of actions.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (spear-phishing, using CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE, and then exploiting and installing malware) is not the most plausible. The tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE are more likely to be used after gaining initial access and exploiting the system, not before.

### Final Answer:
B: No
