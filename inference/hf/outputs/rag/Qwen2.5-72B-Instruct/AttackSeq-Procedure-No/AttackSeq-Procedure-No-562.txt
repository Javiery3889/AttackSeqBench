### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have identified the geographical location of a victim host before using T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1012 (Query Registry) as part of their Discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves determining the physical or logical location of a system, which can include geographical location, network segment, or data center.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery** is directly related to identifying the geographical location of a victim host.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** and **T1012-Query Registry** are both part of the Discovery phase but focus on different aspects of the system. T1057 involves identifying running processes, while T1012 involves querying the registry for system information.
   - It is logical for attackers to first determine the geographical location of a victim host (T1614) to understand the context and environment of the target before delving into more detailed discovery activities like T1057 and T1012. This can help them tailor their subsequent actions to the specific environment and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of operations and the related TTPs, it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have identified the geographical location of a victim host before employing T1057 and T1012.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
