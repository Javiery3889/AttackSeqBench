### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a backdoor program, after gathering host information during the discovery phase, would use DNS for C2 (Command and Control) communication directly, rather than using DNS tunneling to establish communication and then parsing the returned data to extract commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1071.004-DNS, which is a sub-technique under the Command and Control tactic. This sub-technique specifically refers to the use of DNS for C2 communication, often through DNS tunneling.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the backdoor program uses DNS for C2 communication directly, without the need for DNS tunneling.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the backdoor program uses DNS tunneling to establish communication with the C2 server, then parses the returned data to extract commands.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **DNS Tunneling (T1071.004):**
     - DNS tunneling is a sophisticated method where attackers encode data into DNS queries and responses to communicate with a C2 server. This method is often used to bypass network security measures that might block other forms of C2 communication.
   - **Direct DNS Communication:**
     - Direct DNS communication typically involves using DNS queries to send and receive data, but it is less sophisticated and more likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - **Context of the Question:**
     - The question mentions that the backdoor program is gathering host information during the discovery phase, which suggests a more advanced and stealthy approach. DNS tunneling aligns better with this context because it is a more covert method of C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No

The backdoor program is more likely to use DNS tunneling to establish communication with the C2 server, parse the returned data, and extract commands, rather than using DNS for C2 communication directly.
