### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PyFlash and NetFlash backdoors are likely to use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography.
   - The key points are:
     - PyFlash gathers OS-related information.
     - PyFlash sends this information to the C&C server.
     - The question is about the use of HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Command and Control**
     - **Technique: T1573.002 - Asymmetric Cryptography**
   - This TTP indicates that the use of Asymmetric Cryptography is a known technique for securing C&C communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - HTTPS is a secure protocol that uses SSL/TLS for encryption, which can include Asymmetric Cryptography.
     - Asymmetric Cryptography is a common method for securing communications, especially in C&C channels to prevent eavesdropping and ensure data integrity.
     - Given the TTP T1573.002, it is plausible that PyFlash and NetFlash would use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography to secure their communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that PyFlash and NetFlash do not use HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography for their C&C communications.
     - This is less likely given the TTP T1573.002, which specifically mentions Asymmetric Cryptography in the context of C&C communications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the common practice in securing C&C communications, the most plausible answer is that PyFlash and NetFlash are likely to use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
