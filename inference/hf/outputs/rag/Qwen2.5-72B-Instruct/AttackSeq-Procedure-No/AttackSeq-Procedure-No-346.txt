### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has discovered system information and process lists using the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use a SOCK5 proxy between infected hosts for its command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware discovering running processes on the system, which is consistent with the use of the `tasklist` command.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique involves the use of a proxy to route C2 traffic. Specifically, a SOCK5 proxy can be used to forward traffic between infected hosts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that the malware has already performed process discovery and system information gathering, it is plausible that the next step in the attack sequence could involve setting up a C2 channel.
     - The use of a SOCK5 proxy (T1090) is a common technique for routing C2 traffic, especially in environments where direct communication might be restricted or monitored.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use a SOCK5 proxy for C2 operations. However, given the context of the related TTPs and the typical progression of an attack, this seems less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack stages, it is more plausible that the malware will use a SOCK5 proxy for its C2 operations after discovering system information and processes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
