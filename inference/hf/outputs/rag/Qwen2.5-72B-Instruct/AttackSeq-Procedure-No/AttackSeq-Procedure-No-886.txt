### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor is likely to enumerate AWS storage services (S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes) during the Discovery phase after establishing persistence through the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key, and then send the collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering cloud storage objects, such as AWS S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves the adversary using the 'Run' registry key or the 'Startup' folder to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is the same as the one listed under Privilege Escalation, indicating that the adversary is using the 'Run' registry key or the 'Startup' folder to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:** The Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key, which is consistent with the T1547.001 technique.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The question mentions the enumeration of AWS storage services, which aligns with the T1619 technique (Cloud Storage Object Discovery).
   - **Command and Control Phase:** The question also mentions sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password, which is a common technique for exfiltrating data and maintaining communication with the C&C server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (establishing persistence, enumerating cloud storage services, and sending data to the C&C domain) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs provided.
   - The techniques T1547.001 and T1619 are directly relevant to the steps mentioned in the question.
