### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Grandoreiro, after ensuring persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory, is likely to communicate with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP before collecting information such as usernames during its discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying shortcut files (e.g., .LNK files) to execute malicious code when a user opens the shortcut.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
     - This technique is similar to the persistence technique but focuses on privilege escalation.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves adding a program to the Windows Registry Run keys or the Startup folder to ensure it runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question mentions that Grandoreiro ensures persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. This aligns with the T1547.009 and T1547.001 techniques.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The question asks if Grandoreiro is likely to communicate with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP before collecting information.
     - The related TTPs do not provide specific information about communication methods or the use of the RealThinClient SDK.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question mentions collecting information such as usernames during the discovery phase. This is a common step in many malware operations, but the related TTPs do not specifically mention this phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs confirm the persistence mechanism but do not provide information about the communication method or the discovery phase.
   - Given the lack of specific information about the communication method and the discovery phase in the related TTPs, it is not possible to definitively state that Grandoreiro will use the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP before collecting information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
