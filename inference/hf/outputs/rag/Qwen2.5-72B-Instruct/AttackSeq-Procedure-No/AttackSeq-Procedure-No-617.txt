### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access, after developing the Bankshot implants.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or document reader) to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments (e.g., Word documents) to gain initial access to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Context of Hidden Cobra:**
     - Hidden Cobra, also known as Lazarus Group, is a well-known threat actor that has been involved in various cyberattacks, particularly targeting financial institutions.
   - **Bankshot Implants:**
     - The Bankshot implants are sophisticated malware designed to give attackers full control over victim systems and can wipe files, which aligns with the resource development tactic.
   - **Spear Phishing and CVE-2018-4878:**
     - Spear phishing is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors, including Hidden Cobra.
     - CVE-2018-4878 is a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, which is a typical method for gaining initial access through malicious documents.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that Hidden Cobra has a history of targeting financial institutions and using sophisticated malware, it is plausible that they would use spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations.
   - The related TTPs (T1203 and T1566.001) support this attack sequence, as they describe the use of client-side exploits and spear phishing with attachments, which are consistent with Hidden Cobra's known tactics.
