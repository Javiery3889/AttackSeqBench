### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the StellarParticle campaign is likely to steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Using web session cookies for credential access.
     - Stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations.
     - Utilizing credential hopping.
     - Configuring malware for WMI persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves using web session cookies to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to gain access to user sessions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Web Session Cookies:**
     - The T1539 technique (Steal Web Session Cookie) is part of the Credential Access tactic, which means it is used to gain initial access to user sessions.
   - **Using Web Session Cookies for Lateral Movement:**
     - The T1550.004 technique (Web Session Cookie) is part of the Lateral Movement tactic, which means it is used to move from one system to another within the network.
   - **Credential Hopping:**
     - Credential hopping is a technique where an attacker uses stolen credentials to move from one system to another. This is often part of the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - **Configuring Malware for WMI Persistence:**
     - Configuring malware for WMI persistence is a technique used to maintain access to a system over time. This is part of the Persistence tactic.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where the campaign steals web session cookies only after using credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.
   - However, the related TTPs indicate that stealing web session cookies (T1539) is typically done to gain initial access, which would logically occur before lateral movement (T1550.004) and persistence (WMI persistence).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs, it is more likely that the campaign would steal web session cookies first to gain initial access, then use those cookies for lateral movement, and finally configure malware for persistence.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question (stealing web session cookies only after credential hopping and WMI persistence) is not the most plausible.

### Final Answer: B: No
