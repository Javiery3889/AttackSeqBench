### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malware will initiate a download via FTP after collecting information during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering the system time, which can be used for various purposes such as timing attacks or avoiding detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering files and directories on the system, which can be useful for identifying sensitive data to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves the malware using file transfer protocols (like FTP) to exfiltrate data or download additional components.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The malware has already collected information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. This aligns with the Discovery phase techniques (T1124 and T1083).
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - The question asks if the malware will initiate a download via FTP. The related TTP (T1071.002) specifically mentions the use of file transfer protocols for exfiltration or downloading additional components.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that after collecting data, the malware might use FTP to exfiltrate the collected data or to download additional components as part of the Command and Control phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the sequence, the most likely answer is that the malware will initiate a download via FTP as part of the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
