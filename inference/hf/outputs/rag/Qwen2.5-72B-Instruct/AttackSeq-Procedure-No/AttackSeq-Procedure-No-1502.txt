### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: port scanning, system reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement using Metasploit.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Anunak malware will retrieve encrypted commands from its command and control (C2) server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:** This technique involves the adversary using the victim's system resources for malicious purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary transferring tools or other files from the C2 server to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port Scanning, System Reconnaissance, Privilege Escalation, and Lateral Movement:** These are common initial steps in a cyber attack to gain a foothold and move within the network.
   - **Anunak Malware:** Anunak (also known as Carbanak) is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attacks, often involving the use of C2 servers to issue commands and perform various malicious activities.
   - **Retrieve Encrypted Commands from C2 Server:** Given that Anunak is known for its use of C2 servers and encrypted communication, it is plausible that it would retrieve encrypted commands for follow-on actions.
   - **Follow-on Actions (Cryptocurrency Mining):** The related TTP T1496.001-Compute Hijacking indicates that the adversary might use the victim's system resources for cryptocurrency mining, which aligns with the question's scenario.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the Anunak malware will retrieve encrypted commands from its C2 server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
