### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect browser bookmark information (a discovery technique) before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests (a command and control technique).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the implant uses HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This indicates that the implant collects browser information, including bookmarks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant does collect browser bookmark information before communicating with control servers.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1217-Browser Information Discovery** (Discovery) is a logical step to gather information about the victim's environment.
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** (Command and Control) is a subsequent step to exfiltrate the collected information or receive further commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant does not collect browser bookmark information before communicating with control servers.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as T1217 is listed as a relevant technique, indicating that browser information discovery is a part of the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible answer is that the Rising Sun implant does collect browser bookmark information as part of discovery before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
