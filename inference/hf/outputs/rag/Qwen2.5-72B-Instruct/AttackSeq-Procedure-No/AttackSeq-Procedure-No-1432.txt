### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Smooth Operator malware, after establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, is likely to exfiltrate its collected data using the MIME protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic:** Exfiltration
     - **Technique:** T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
   - T1041 describes the method where adversaries exfiltrate data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication. This technique often involves using the same protocols and ports that are already established for C2 to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If the malware is using HTTPS for C2 communication and a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, it is less likely to switch to MIME for exfiltration. MIME is typically used for email and is not a common protocol for C2 communication or data exfiltration in the context of malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - Given that the malware is already using HTTPS and a custom encoding algorithm, it is more likely to continue using the same channel and methods for exfiltration. Switching to MIME would introduce additional complexity and potential detection risks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will continue to use the established HTTPS channel for exfiltration rather than switching to MIME.

**Final Answer: B: No**
