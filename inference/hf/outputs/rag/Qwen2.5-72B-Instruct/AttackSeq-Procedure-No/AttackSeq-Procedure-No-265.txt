### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions taken by the Korplug variant after establishing persistence.
   - The specific actions in question are:
     - Creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%`.
     - Setting up a scheduled task or registry entry for persistence.
     - Exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.
     - Collecting information about the system, including using the `GetSystemTime` function for system time discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:**
     - This technique involves creating hidden files and directories to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of scheduled tasks in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if the Korplug variant is likely to exfiltrate data via a custom TCP-based protocol **before** collecting system information.
   - The related TTPs focus on persistence and defense evasion, but do not explicitly mention data exfiltration or system information collection.
   - Typically, in a cyber attack, the sequence of actions might be:
     1. Establish persistence.
     2. Collect system information.
     3. Exfiltrate data.
   - The question suggests a different sequence where data exfiltration happens before system information collection, which is less common and less logical in most attack scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack and the lack of explicit mention of data exfiltration in the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the Korplug variant is **not** likely to exfiltrate data via a custom TCP-based protocol before collecting system information.

**Final Answer: B: No**
