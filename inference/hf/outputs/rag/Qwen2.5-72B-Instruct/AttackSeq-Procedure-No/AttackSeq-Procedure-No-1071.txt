### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Tropic Trooper, after using DLL hijacking to load a malicious DLL (wab32res.dll) through a benign file during the Defense Evasion phase, is likely to use SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL by placing it in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate program.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to load and execute a malicious DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique is used to load a malicious DLL (wab32res.dll) through a benign file, which is a part of the Defense Evasion phase.
   - **Rundll32 (T1218.011):** This technique is also used to load and execute a malicious DLL, which can be part of the Defense Evasion phase.

   - The question specifically mentions that the DLL hijacking and loading of the malicious DLL occur during the Defense Evasion phase. This implies that the malicious activity is already in progress during this phase.

   - The use of SSL to connect to the C&C server is typically a part of the Command and Control (C2) phase, which can occur before, during, or after the Defense Evasion phase. However, the question asks if it is likely that SSL is used only before the Defense Evasion phase.

   - Given that the Defense Evasion phase involves loading the malicious DLL, it is more plausible that the C2 communication (using SSL) would occur after or during the Defense Evasion phase, not exclusively before it.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that Tropic Trooper will use SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase. The C2 communication is more likely to occur during or after the Defense Evasion phase.

Final Answer: B: No
