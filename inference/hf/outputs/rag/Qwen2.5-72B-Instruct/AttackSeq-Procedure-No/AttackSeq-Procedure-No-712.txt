### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gallmaker will use the DDE protocol to gain initial access, then leverage Scheduled Tasks through a GPO to execute specific tools (WindowsRoamingToolsTask and reverse_tcp payload), and finally adopt living off the land (LotL) tactics for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves exploiting the DDE protocol in Microsoft Office to execute arbitrary commands or scripts, which can be used for initial access.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using Scheduled Tasks to execute commands or scripts at specific times, which can be used for persistence and execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (DDE):** The use of DDE to gain initial access is a known technique and aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Execution and Persistence (Scheduled Task):** Leveraging Scheduled Tasks through a GPO to execute tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask and reverse_tcp payload is a plausible next step. Scheduled Tasks can be used to maintain persistence and execute payloads at specific intervals.
   - **Living off the Land (LotL):** After gaining initial access and establishing persistence, it is common for attackers to use LotL tactics to evade detection. LotL tactics involve using built-in system tools and utilities to perform malicious activities, which can be less detectable than using custom malware.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (DDE for initial access, Scheduled Tasks for execution and persistence, and LotL for defense evasion) is a logical and common attack pattern. Each step builds on the previous one, making it a plausible sequence of TTPs.
