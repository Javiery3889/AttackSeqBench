### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a backdoor, after collecting machine information and taking screenshots during the Discovery and Collection tactics, is likely to use cloud storage services like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive to host malicious downloads during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate web services, such as cloud storage services, to host command and control (C2) infrastructure. These services can be used to store and distribute malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, and communicate with the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the T1102-Web Service technique, it is plausible that a backdoor would use cloud storage services like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive to host malicious downloads. These services are often used by adversaries because they are widely available, reliable, and can blend in with legitimate traffic, making them harder to detect.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would be less likely because the T1102-Web Service technique specifically mentions the use of web services, including cloud storage, for C2 activities. Ignoring this technique would not align with the provided context.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor is likely to use cloud storage services for hosting malicious downloads during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
