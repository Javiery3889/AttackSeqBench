### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on a local system before exfiltration.
   - **T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT10's TTPs:**
     - APT10 is known for using a variety of techniques for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - They often leverage compromised credentials and infrastructure to move laterally within a network.
     - They have been known to use SAML token abuse for lateral movement, especially in environments with AD FS.
     - They also use data staging techniques, including local and remote data staging, to prepare data for exfiltration.

   - **SAML Token Abuse:**
     - SAML token abuse is a sophisticated technique that can be used to gain access to resources and move laterally within a network.
     - This technique is particularly useful in environments with AD FS, where SAML tokens are used for authentication.

   - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:**
     - APT10 has been known to leverage shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure to gain access to multiple victim networks.
     - This technique can be more efficient and less detectable than other methods of lateral movement.

   - **Data Staging:**
     - The related TTPs (T1074.001 and T1074.002) indicate that APT10 uses both local and remote data staging techniques to prepare data for exfiltration.
     - Staging data in the Recycle Bin using compression tools is a common method to avoid detection and ensure data integrity during exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sophistication of APT10 and their known use of SAML token abuse for lateral movement, it is plausible that they would use this technique in a compromised AD FS environment.
   - However, the question also mentions leveraging shared MSP infrastructure, which is another known technique used by APT10 for lateral movement.
   - The data staging techniques (T1074.001 and T1074.002) are consistent with APT10's methods of preparing data for exfiltration.

   - The question asks whether APT10 is **likely** to use SAML token abuse instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure. Given that both techniques are part of APT10's toolkit, the choice of which to use would depend on the specific context of the attack and the available resources.

   - However, the question implies a choice between the two, and given the sophistication and adaptability of APT10, they are more likely to use the most effective and least detectable method available to them.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

APT10 is more likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement, as it is a known and effective technique that aligns with their operational patterns. While SAML token abuse is also a plausible technique, the question implies a choice, and the shared MSP infrastructure method is more consistent with their known TTPs.
