### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after using SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server via HTTPS and employing multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a schedule to transfer data at specific intervals.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique aligns with the part of the question that mentions exfiltrating data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique aligns with the part of the question that mentions exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which is consistent with using SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server via HTTPS and employing multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question describes a sequence where data is exfiltrated using a scheduled transfer method (T1029) and over the C2 channel (T1041). Both of these techniques are mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - The use of SparrowDoor for C2 communication and multi-byte XOR keys for encryption is consistent with the C2 channel exfiltration technique (T1041).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
