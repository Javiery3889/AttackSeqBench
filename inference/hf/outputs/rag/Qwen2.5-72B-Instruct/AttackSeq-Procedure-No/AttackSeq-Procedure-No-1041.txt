### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server only after sending system information to the C2 server, or if it will collect system information again before entering the loop.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data from the compromised system to the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server only after sending system information to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that POWERSHOWER will not enter a communications loop with the C2 server only after sending system information to the C2 server, implying that it might collect system information again before entering the loop.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial System Information Collection:**
     - POWERSHOWER typically collects system information as part of its initial reconnaissance phase to understand the environment it is operating in.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - After collecting system information, POWERSHOWER sends this information to the C2 server using T1041.
   - **Communications Loop:**
     - Once the initial system information is exfiltrated, POWERSHOWER may enter a communications loop with the C2 server to receive further commands or instructions.
   - **Re-collection of System Information:**
     - It is less likely that POWERSHOWER would re-collect system information before entering the communications loop, as the initial collection is usually sufficient for the initial phase of the attack.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
