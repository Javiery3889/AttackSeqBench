### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker achieves persistence by scheduling a task to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attack executed an embedded .hta file using `mshta.exe` only after using Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at regular intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions using Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access. This aligns with the T1203 technique, which involves exploiting a client application.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question also mentions scheduling a task to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes, which aligns with the T1053.005 technique for persistence.
   - **Execution of .hta File:**
     - The question asks if the .hta file was executed using `mshta.exe` only after the initial access. The use of `mshta.exe` to execute .hta files is a common technique for executing malicious code, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question (initial access via CVE-2017-0199, then persistence via scheduled task, and finally execution of .hta file) is plausible. However, the question specifically asks if the .hta file was executed only after the initial access, which is not necessarily implied by the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of events described in the question is plausible, but the specific detail about the .hta file being executed only after the initial access is not strongly supported by the related TTPs. The use of `mshta.exe` to execute .hta files is a common technique, but it is not explicitly tied to the initial access method in the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
