### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a malicious document will use the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands after contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication between the malware and the control server. The first stage might involve initial contact and the distribution of a first-stage payload, which can then lead to further stages of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using the DDE feature in Microsoft Office to execute commands. DDE can be used to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands, which is a common method for executing malicious payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that the malicious document will use DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is plausible. The multi-stage command and control operation (T1104) often involves initial contact and the distribution of a first-stage payload. The use of DDE (T1559.002) to invoke PowerShell and execute commands is a common technique for executing the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the malicious document will use DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands.
     - This is less plausible given the related TTPs. The use of DDE to invoke PowerShell is a well-documented technique in multi-stage attacks, especially in the context of initial payload execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the malicious document will use the DDE technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
