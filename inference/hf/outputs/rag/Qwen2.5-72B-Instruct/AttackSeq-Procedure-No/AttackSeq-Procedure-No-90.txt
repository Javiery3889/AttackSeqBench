### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva, after creating a new service for persistence and decrypting strings for defense evasion, is likely to enumerate all users and their roles from a victim's main treasury system as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries attempting to identify and enumerate user accounts and their roles.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves adversaries compressing data using libraries like zlib to prepare it for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Account Discovery (T1087):** This is a common discovery technique used to understand the environment and identify potential targets. Enumerating users and their roles is a logical step in this process.
   - **File and Directory Discovery (T1083):** This technique helps adversaries locate specific files and directories that may be of interest for collection.
   - **Archive via Library (T1560.002):** This technique is used to compress files for easier exfiltration, which typically follows the discovery and collection phases.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves creating a new service for persistence and decrypting strings for defense evasion. These are initial steps to establish a foothold and avoid detection.
   - After these initial steps, it is logical for the adversary to perform discovery activities to understand the environment better. Enumerating users and their roles (T1087) is a crucial part of this discovery phase.
   - Once the adversary has identified the users and roles, they may then proceed to discover specific files and directories (T1083) that are of interest.
   - Finally, the adversary would compress the collected files (T1560.002) to prepare them for exfiltration.
