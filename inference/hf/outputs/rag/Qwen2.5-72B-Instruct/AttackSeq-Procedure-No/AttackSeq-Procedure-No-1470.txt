### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlackEnergy 3, after reconnaissance activities, will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads following installation through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves the adversary using user activity to gather information about the target environment.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves the adversary using Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute commands or payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:** The question mentions reconnaissance activities such as gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods. This aligns with the T1497.002 technique, which involves user activity based checks to gather information.
   - **Employee-Enabled Macro Execution:** The question also mentions that the malware is installed through employee-enabled macro execution. This is a common method for initial infection, often using Office documents with malicious macros.
   - **Ruby Scripts for Payload Execution:** The question asks if it is likely that Ruby scripts will be used to execute payloads. However, the related TTPs mention Visual Basic (T1059.005) rather than Ruby. This suggests that the malware is more likely to use Visual Basic for payload execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the related TTPs specifically mention the use of Visual Basic (T1059.005) for execution, it is less likely that BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts for payload execution. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
