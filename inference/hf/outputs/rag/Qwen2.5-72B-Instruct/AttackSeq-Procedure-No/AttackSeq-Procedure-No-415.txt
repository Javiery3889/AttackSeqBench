### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that UNC1945 used anti-forensics techniques, specifically executing the STEELCORGI ELF packer in memory for log obfuscation, before escalating privileges using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and other tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing:**
     - This technique involves using software packers to obfuscate the true nature of a file or executable, making it harder for defenders to analyze or detect.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves altering the appearance of files or information to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that UNC1945 did use anti-forensics techniques, specifically executing the STEELCORGI ELF packer in memory for log obfuscation, before escalating privileges.
     - The related TTPs (T1027.002 and T1027) align with the use of software packing and obfuscation, which are common anti-forensics techniques.
     - The sequence described in the question (using STEELCORGI for log obfuscation before privilege escalation) is a plausible and logical sequence of actions for an advanced threat actor like UNC1945.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that UNC1945 did not use the described anti-forensics techniques.
     - Given the related TTPs and the known sophistication of UNC1945, it is less likely that they would skip such techniques, especially when they are known to use advanced methods to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that UNC1945 did employ anti-forensics techniques as described.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
