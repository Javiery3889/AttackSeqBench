### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the PIVY variant:
     - It communicates with C2 servers using application layer protocols.
     - It is then asked whether it is likely to evade defenses by using DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL and modify its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves the malware using legitimate protocols or services to communicate with C2 servers to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves the malware using a legitimate application to load a malicious DLL, thereby evading detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The PIVY variant uses application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers, which aligns with the T1001.003 technique (Protocol or Service Impersonation). This is a common method to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
   - **Evasion Using DLL Sideloading:**
     - After establishing communication with the C2 servers, the malware might use DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL. This technique (T1574.002) is used to evade detection by security tools by leveraging legitimate applications to load malicious code.
   - **Modifying Configuration Data:**
     - Modifying configuration data to confuse tools parsing configuration data is a plausible next step in the evasion process. By altering the configuration, the malware can make it harder for security tools to identify and analyze its behavior.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described, it is likely that the PIVY variant will use DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL and modify its configuration to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
