### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Longhorn (an assumed threat actor) will follow specific guidelines to avoid detection (as outlined in the Vault 7 documents) only after performing detailed system fingerprinting and before gaining initial access via a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document to infect the target with Plexor malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a Word document) to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering file and directory paths on the target system, which is a form of system fingerprinting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery):** This is the first step where the adversary performs detailed system fingerprinting to understand the target environment.
     - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** This is the next step where the adversary uses a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Guidelines from Vault 7:**
     - The Vault 7 documents are known to contain techniques and guidelines for avoiding detection. However, the question specifies that these guidelines are followed "only before gaining initial access."
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is unlikely that an adversary would follow guidelines to avoid detection only after performing detailed system fingerprinting and before gaining initial access. Typically, an adversary would follow such guidelines throughout the entire attack lifecycle to maintain stealth.
     - The sequence described in the question seems to suggest a disjointed approach where the adversary performs discovery, then follows detection avoidance guidelines, and then exploits the vulnerability. This is not a typical or logical sequence of events in a well-planned attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not plausible. The adversary would likely follow detection avoidance guidelines throughout the attack, not just in a specific segment.

**Final Answer: B: No**
