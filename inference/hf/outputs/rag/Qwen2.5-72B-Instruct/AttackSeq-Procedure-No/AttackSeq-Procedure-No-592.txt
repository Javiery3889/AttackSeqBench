### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that OilRig will abuse Outlook Rules using tools like Ruler to establish persistence before the Trojan communicates with its C2 server via HTTP requests and DNS tunneling.
   - The key elements are:
     - Execution of ISMAgent payload via VBScript.
     - Abusing Outlook Rules for persistence.
     - Communication with C2 server via HTTP and DNS tunneling.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.005-Outlook Rules:**
     - This technique involves modifying Outlook rules to execute a payload or maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page:**
     - This technique involves modifying the Outlook Home Page to execute a payload or maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain command and control (C2) in case the primary channel fails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that OilRig will abuse Outlook Rules using tools like Ruler to establish persistence before the Trojan communicates with its C2 server.
     - The related TTP T1137.005 (Outlook Rules) supports the idea of using Outlook Rules for persistence.
     - The sequence of establishing persistence before communicating with the C2 server is a common tactic to ensure the malware remains active and can communicate even if the initial infection vector is removed.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that OilRig will not abuse Outlook Rules using tools like Ruler to establish persistence before the Trojan communicates with its C2 server.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1137.005 (Outlook Rules), which indicates that using Outlook Rules for persistence is a known technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common sequence of establishing persistence before communication, the most plausible answer is that OilRig will abuse Outlook Rules using tools like Ruler to establish persistence before the Trojan communicates with its C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
