### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` only after using other identified C2 domains.
   - The context is a phishing campaign where the malware is delivered via a spearphishing link disguised as a Curriculum Vitae.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with a link that, when clicked, delivers the malware to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - The malware is delivered via a spearphishing link, which is a common initial access technique.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Typically, once the malware is executed on the victim's system, it will establish a connection to a C2 server to receive further instructions.
     - The question implies a sequence where the malware might use multiple C2 domains, but it does not specify that the initial communication must be delayed until after using other C2 domains.
   - **Plausibility of Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Yes** - This would mean the malware does not communicate with `judystevenson[.]info` until after using other C2 domains. This is less common because the initial C2 communication is usually the first step to establish control.
     - **B: No** - This would mean the malware communicates with `judystevenson[.]info` as soon as it is executed, which is more typical in initial access scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the context provided, the most plausible sequence is that the malware will communicate with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` as soon as it is executed, without waiting to use other C2 domains.

**Final Answer: B: No**
