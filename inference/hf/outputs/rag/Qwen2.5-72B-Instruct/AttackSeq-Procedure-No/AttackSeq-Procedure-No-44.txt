### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, staging encrypted data in a temporary folder, and then potentially dividing files if they exceed a certain size before exfiltration.
   - The specific size threshold mentioned is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data in a local directory before exfiltration. This is consistent with the described action of staging encrypted data in a temporary folder.
   - **T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection. This is relevant to the question of whether files are divided if they exceed a certain size.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If Machete is designed to avoid detection, it would make sense to divide large files to reduce the size of each exfiltrated chunk. This aligns with the T1030 technique, which suggests that attackers may limit the size of data transferred to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If Machete does not divide files, it would risk transferring large files that could be more easily detected by network monitoring tools. This would be less consistent with the T1030 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the T1030 technique, which involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection, it is more plausible that Machete would divide files if they exceed 16 MB before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
