### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tortoiseshell gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a malicious domain (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com).
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence before the malware downloader executes binaries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to execute malicious code when the system starts or at regular intervals, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is often the initial vector for gaining access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1204.002-Malicious File):** The question states that the initial access is gained by tricking users into downloading a fake app. This aligns with the T1204.002 technique.
   - **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service):** After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to establish persistence to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system. Installing a RAT as a Windows service is a typical method for achieving this.
   - **Execution of Binaries:** The question mentions that a malware downloader executes binaries. This typically happens after the initial access and persistence have been established.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns. The initial access is gained through a malicious file, and then the attacker installs a RAT as a Windows service to maintain persistence. After that, the malware downloader can execute additional binaries.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
