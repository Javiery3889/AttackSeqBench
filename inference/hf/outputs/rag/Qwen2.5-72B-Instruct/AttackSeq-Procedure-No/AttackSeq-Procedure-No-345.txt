### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will use the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to discover system information and process lists after using HTTPS for command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about running processes on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` is a common way to gather both system information and process lists.
     - `tasklist` is used to list all running processes, which aligns with T1057-Process Discovery.
     - `systeminfo` provides detailed information about the system, which aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the malware does not use the specified command to gather system information and process lists, which contradicts the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the command provided, it is highly likely that the malware will use `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to discover system information and process lists.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
