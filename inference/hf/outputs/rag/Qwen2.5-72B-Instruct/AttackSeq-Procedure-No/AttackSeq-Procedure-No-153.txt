### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts after using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2) infrastructure with tools like Robocopy and PSCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves an adversary staging collected data in a central location or directory on the network before exfiltration. This can include compressing and splitting data into multi-part archives.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves the use of multiple stages of C2 infrastructure to maintain persistence and resilience. This can include using dynamic-DNS domains to dynamically change C2 server addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains for C2:**
     - APT10 is known to use dynamic-DNS domains to maintain flexible and resilient C2 infrastructure. This aligns with the T1104 technique.
   - **Tools like Robocopy and PSCP:**
     - Robocopy and PSCP are commonly used for file transfer and synchronization. Robocopy is a built-in Windows utility for file copying, and PSCP is a command-line secure file copy program. These tools can be used to transfer data to a staging location.
   - **Staging Data for Exfiltration:**
     - The T1074.002 technique describes the process of staging data in a central location before exfiltration. This often involves compressing and splitting data into multi-part archives to make exfiltration more efficient and less detectable.
   - **Remote Command Execution:**
     - APT10 is known to use remote command execution scripts to automate and control the data staging and exfiltration process. This aligns with the need to compress and split data using tools like 7zip or WinRAR.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the known behavior of APT10, it is highly likely that APT10 will stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts after setting up dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
