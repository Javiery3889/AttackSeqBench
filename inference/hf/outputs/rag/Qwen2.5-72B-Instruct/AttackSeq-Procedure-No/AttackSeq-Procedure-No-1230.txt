### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group, starting with the establishment of command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the group engaged in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data from a victim's network using the same channel that is used for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:**
     - This technique involves stealing financial data or funds from the victim.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group likely engaged in double-extortion ransomware.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** indicates that the group has the capability to exfiltrate data using the same channel they use for C&C communication.
       - **T1657-Financial Theft** suggests that the group is interested in financial gain, which aligns with the motivation behind double-extortion ransomware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group did not engage in double-extortion ransomware.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1041 and T1657 indicate activities that are consistent with double-extortion ransomware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the Lazarus group likely engaged in double-extortion ransomware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
