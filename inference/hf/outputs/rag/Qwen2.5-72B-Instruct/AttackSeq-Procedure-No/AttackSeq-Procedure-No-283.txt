### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ZoxPNG, after establishing initial contact with the C2 server via an HTTP GET request, will likely use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary server to mask the true source of the traffic or to bypass security controls.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy:** This sub-technique involves using an external proxy server to route traffic, which can help in evading detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Contact:** The question states that ZoxPNG establishes initial contact with the C2 server using an HTTP GET request. This aligns with the **T1071.001-Web Protocols** technique.
   - **Exploiting Proxy Settings:** The question then asks if ZoxPNG will use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion. The **T1090-Proxy** and **T1090.002-External Proxy** techniques suggest that using a proxy is a common method for evading detection. The WinInet API is a common way to interact with web protocols and proxy settings in Windows environments.
   - **WinInet API:** The WinInet API is often used by malware to handle HTTP/HTTPS requests and can be configured to use proxy settings. This makes it a plausible method for ZoxPNG to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is plausible that ZoxPNG would use the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion after establishing initial contact with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
