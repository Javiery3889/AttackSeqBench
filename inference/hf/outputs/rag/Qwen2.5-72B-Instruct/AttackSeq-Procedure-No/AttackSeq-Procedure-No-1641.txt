### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after exfiltrating staged and compressed data to cloud storage services like Dropbox or OneDrive, it is likely that the adversary will perform lateral movement to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on newly compromised systems, identify data of interest through further discovery, and collect data from information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage:** This technique involves collecting data from cloud storage services.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exfiltration:**
     - The question starts with the adversary exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which aligns with the T1567.002 technique.
   - **Lateral Movement and Beacon Deployment:**
     - After exfiltration, the question asks if the adversary will perform lateral movement to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on newly compromised systems. This is a common next step in many attack sequences to gain further access and control.
   - **Further Discovery and Data Collection:**
     - Once the adversary has deployed beacons, they would likely perform further discovery to identify data of interest. This aligns with the Collection tactic, which includes techniques like T1530 (Data from Cloud Storage) and other discovery techniques.
   - **Collecting Data from Information Repositories:**
     - After identifying data of interest, the adversary would likely collect data from information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online, which is part of the Collection tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the common attack patterns, it is likely that the adversary will perform lateral movement, deploy beacons, and continue with further discovery and data collection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
