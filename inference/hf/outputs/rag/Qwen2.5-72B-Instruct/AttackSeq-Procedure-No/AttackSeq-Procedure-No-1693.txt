### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components (including the Graphite malware) only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager, following the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, often for further stages of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The attackers first exploit the vulnerability in Microsoft Office to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **PowerShell Execution (T1059.001):** After gaining initial access, the attackers use PowerShell to execute the Empire stager, which is a common post-exploitation tool used to establish a foothold and perform further actions.
   - **Acquiring Domains and Developing Malicious Components:** These actions are typically part of the pre-attack or early stages of the attack, not necessarily after the initial exploitation and execution of the Empire stager. Acquiring domains and developing malware are often done in preparation for the attack, not as a result of the attack itself.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager. However, this is unlikely because these actions are typically part of the preparation phase of the attack, which occurs before the exploitation and post-exploitation stages.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not likely that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

### Final Answer: B: No
