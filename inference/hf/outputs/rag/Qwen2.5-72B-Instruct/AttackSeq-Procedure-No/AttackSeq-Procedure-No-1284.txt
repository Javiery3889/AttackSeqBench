### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Bvp47, a malware known for its sophisticated techniques.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a loader to decrypt and load its payload.
     - Achieving persistence by hiding its processes, files, and network connections.
   - The question then asks if Bvp47 is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections as part of its discovery tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering network connections to other systems, which is a common step in the discovery phase to map the network and identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves adversaries deobfuscating or decoding files or information to execute their payload, which aligns with the initial step of decrypting and loading the payload.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure the malware runs at system boot or logon, which aligns with the persistence step.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that Bvp47 has already achieved persistence and hidden its presence, it is logical for the malware to proceed with network discovery to identify other systems it can compromise. The related TTP T1049 (System Network Connections Discovery) directly supports this step.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Bvp47 would not engage in network discovery, which seems less likely given the malware's sophisticated nature and the common practice of network mapping in the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of the attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that Bvp47 will remotely discover systems over LAN connections as part of its discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
