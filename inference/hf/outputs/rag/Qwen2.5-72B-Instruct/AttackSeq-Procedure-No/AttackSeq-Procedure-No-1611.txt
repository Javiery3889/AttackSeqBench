### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Cosmic Banker malware:
     - Accessing Outlook information to collect email accounts.
     - Targeting Mexican financial institution users.
     - Displaying text related to an alleged data update request.
     - Executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level.
     - Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at specific times or under certain conditions.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Accessing Outlook Information:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the victim.
   - **Targeting Mexican Financial Institution Users:**
     - This is a specific targeting strategy that aligns with the goals of financial malware.
   - **Displaying Text Related to an Alleged Data Update Request:**
     - This is a social engineering tactic to trick users into performing actions that will execute the malware.
   - **Executing a Malicious Batch File to Run a PowerShell Script at Memory Level:**
     - This is a common method for executing malicious code in memory to avoid detection.
   - **Enabling Persistence through Creating Shortcuts and Manipulating Scheduled Tasks:**
     - The related TTPs (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) confirm that creating or modifying scheduled tasks is a known technique for persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs and the typical behavior of financial malware like Cosmic Banker. The use of social engineering, execution of malicious code, and persistence mechanisms are all consistent with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
