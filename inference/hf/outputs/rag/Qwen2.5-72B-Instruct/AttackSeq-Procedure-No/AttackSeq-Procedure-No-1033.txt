### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will compress proprietary data using WinRAR in the Collection phase after exfiltrating files to Dropbox and using cURL for Windows during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves using built-in utilities to compress data, such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or tar.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves using custom scripts or tools to compress data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The question states that the attackers have already exfiltrated files to Dropbox using cURL for Windows. This indicates that the data has already been collected and is being sent out of the network.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The Collection phase typically involves gathering data from the target system before it is exfiltrated. Compressing data is often done to reduce the size of the data and make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - If the data has already been exfiltrated (Exfiltration phase), it is unlikely that the attackers would go back to the Collection phase to compress the data. Compressing data is usually done before exfiltration to make the exfiltration process more efficient.
   - **Related TTPs:**
     - The related TTPs suggest that compressing data (T1560.001 and T1560.003) is a part of the Collection phase, not the Exfiltration phase. Since the exfiltration has already occurred, it is not logical to compress the data afterward.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the attackers will compress proprietary data using WinRAR in the Collection phase after exfiltrating the files.

**Final Answer: B: No**
