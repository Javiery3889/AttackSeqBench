### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involve social engineering, initial access, backdoor creation, and the deployment of a keystroke and screen capture monitoring tool (Mipko).
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers coordinated ATM withdrawals using physical mules across multiple cities and countries before leveraging captured credentials for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information or develop resources for an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Backdoor Creation:**
     - The use of social engineering techniques to create backdoors and gain initial access is a common tactic in cyber attacks. This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique, which can be used both for initial access and persistence.
   - **Deployment of Mipko:**
     - Deploying Mipko for keystroke and screen capture monitoring is a typical next step after gaining initial access. This allows attackers to gather sensitive information, including credentials.
   - **Coordinated ATM Withdrawals:**
     - Coordinating ATM withdrawals using physical mules is a tactic often associated with financial cybercrime, particularly in cases where attackers have gained access to banking systems or financial data. This step would typically occur after the attackers have obtained the necessary credentials and financial information.
   - **Leveraging Captured Credentials for Lateral Movement:**
     - Once the attackers have captured credentials, they can use them to move laterally within the network, which is a common next step in a multi-stage attack. This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique for persistence and lateral movement.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access and deploying Mipko to capture credentials, it is reasonable for attackers to coordinate ATM withdrawals using physical mules. This would be followed by leveraging the captured credentials for lateral movement within the network.
