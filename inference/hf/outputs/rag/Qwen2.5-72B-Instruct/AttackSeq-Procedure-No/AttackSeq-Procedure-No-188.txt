### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after collecting files using scripts named after various file extensions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the adversary might use web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This suggests that the adversary might use automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This indicates that the adversary might use file transfer protocols (e.g., FTP, SFTP) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTP T1071.002 (File Transfer Protocols) directly supports the use of FTP for C2 communication.
     - However, the question specifies that the scripts are used for collecting files during the Collection phase, not necessarily for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - The related TTP T1071.001 (Web Protocols) suggests that web protocols are more likely to be used for C2 communication.
     - The use of FTP for C2 communication is less common and more easily detectable compared to web protocols.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While FTP is a file transfer protocol and could be used for exfiltration, the question specifically asks about C2 communication.
   - The related TTP T1071.001 (Web Protocols) is more relevant for C2 communication, as web protocols are more commonly used and less likely to raise suspicion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
