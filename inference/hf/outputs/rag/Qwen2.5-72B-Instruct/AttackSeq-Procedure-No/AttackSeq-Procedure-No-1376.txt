### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - A malicious document uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique via PowerShell.
     - This technique is used to download and run encoded commands.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the document will hijack legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or launch applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique is directly mentioned in the question and is used to execute commands via PowerShell.
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique is related to defense evasion and involves hijacking the loading of DLLs, but it does not directly relate to hijacking startup scripts.
   - **Startup Script Hijacking:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a common technique used by APT groups to ensure persistence. This involves modifying or creating startup scripts to ensure that malware runs every time the system starts.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - APT28 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - After gaining initial execution via DDE, it is plausible that APT28 would use additional techniques to ensure the malware persists on the system.
   - Hijacking startup scripts is a common method for achieving persistence, and it aligns with the group's known tactics.
