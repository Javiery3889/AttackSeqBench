### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro.
   - The VBA macro is used to gain initial access.
   - The malware then establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours.
   - Finally, the VBA macro executes commands using `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence. The scheduled task can be used to execute a command or script at a specified interval.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) to execute commands or scripts. VBA is commonly used in Office documents to automate tasks and can be leveraged for malicious purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro is a common method for gaining initial access. This aligns with the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours is a plausible method for establishing persistence. This aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique.
   - **Execution:**
     - Using `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL is a common technique for executing additional malware. This also aligns with the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique, as VBA can be used to execute `mshta.exe`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The VBA macro can be used to gain initial access, create a scheduled task for persistence, and execute commands to download and run additional malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
