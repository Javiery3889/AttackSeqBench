### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Poison Ivy malware, after being delivered via social engineering and executed, will use Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, often through social engineering methods such as phishing emails or malicious links.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves the use of web services, such as cloud storage services, to establish bidirectional communication between the malware and the attacker's command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Poison Ivy is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that has been observed using various C2 mechanisms. While it traditionally uses direct TCP connections, it is not uncommon for malware to adapt and use more stealthy methods, such as cloud services, to avoid detection.
     - The related TTP T1102.002 specifically mentions the use of web services for bidirectional communication, which includes cloud storage services like Google Drive.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Poison Ivy is unlikely to use Google Drive for C2. However, given the adaptability of malware and the increasing use of cloud services to evade detection, this choice seems less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the adaptability of malware, it is plausible that Poison Ivy could use Google Drive for C2 communications. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
