### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the QuasarRAT backdoor, after achieving persistence by installing itself as a service named DILLJUICE, is likely to use the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to execute commands via Windows DDE.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence. The service can be configured to start automatically when the system boots, ensuring that the malware is always running.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands. DDE is a method for inter-process communication in Windows that allows data to be exchanged or shared between applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Windows Service (T1543.003):**
     - The QuasarRAT backdoor installs itself as a service named DILLJUICE to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **Execution via DDE (T1559.002):**
     - DDE is a technique used for executing commands by leveraging the DDE protocol. While it is a valid execution technique, it is not typically used for achieving persistence. Instead, it is more commonly used for executing commands or scripts in the context of an already running process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of the loader using DDE to execute commands after achieving persistence. While DDE is a valid execution technique, it is not a common or necessary step for a backdoor that has already achieved persistence via a Windows service.
   - The primary purpose of DDE is to execute commands or scripts, which is a different phase of the attack lifecycle. Once persistence is achieved, the backdoor can execute commands in other ways, such as through the service itself or by other means.

### Final Answer:
B: No
