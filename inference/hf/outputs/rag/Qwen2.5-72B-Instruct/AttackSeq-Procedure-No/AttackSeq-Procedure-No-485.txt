### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FamousSparrow is likely to read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server before collecting system information during the Discovery phase.
   - The sequence of actions involves:
     - Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access).
     - Reading file contents (Collection).
     - Exfiltrating file contents to the C&C server (Exfiltration).
     - Collecting system information (Discovery).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves reading files from the local system, which aligns with the "reading file contents" part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which aligns with the "dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz" part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data to a C2 (Command and Control) server, which aligns with the "exfiltrating file contents to the C&C server" part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory):** This is the first step where credentials are dumped using a custom version of Mimikatz.
     - **Collection (T1005-Data from Local System):** After gaining access to the system, the next logical step is to collect data, such as reading file contents.
     - **Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel):** Once the data is collected, it is exfiltrated to the C&C server.
     - **Discovery:** Collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types is typically done to understand the environment better and plan further actions.

   - **Logical Order:**
     - The sequence of actions described in the question (dumping credentials, reading file contents, exfiltrating data, and then collecting system information) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks.
     - However, the question specifically asks if FamousSparrow is likely to read file contents and exfiltrate them before collecting system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, it is more likely that FamousSparrow would collect system information (Discovery) before or concurrently with reading and exfiltrating file contents. This is because understanding the environment (Discovery) is crucial for planning further actions, such as identifying valuable data to exfiltrate.

   Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

   **Final Answer: B: No**
