### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Shellbot malware will gather information about the infected host (such as processor details and installed monitoring tools) before maintaining persistent communication with C&C servers via IRC.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like IRC) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as processor details and installed software, to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will gather system information before maintaining persistent communication with C&C servers.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The T1082-System Information Discovery technique is part of the Discovery tactic, which is often performed early in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment.
       - Gathering system information can help the attacker tailor their actions, such as choosing the right commands or avoiding detection.
       - After gathering this information, the malware can then establish and maintain communication with the C&C server using the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not gather system information before maintaining persistent communication with C&C servers.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This is less likely because gathering system information is a common and useful step in the attack lifecycle.
       - Without this information, the attacker may not be able to effectively control the infected host or avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is more plausible that the malware will gather system information before maintaining persistent communication with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
