### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to gather credentials from Group Policy Preferences before accessing the victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.
   - The sequence of actions described includes:
     - Executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level.
     - Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.
     - Gathering credentials from Group Policy Preferences.
     - Accessing the victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.006-Group Policy Preferences**
     - This technique involves gathering credentials from Group Policy Preferences, which can store sensitive information like passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution and Persistence:**
     - The malware first executes a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level and then enables persistence through scheduled tasks. This aligns with the T1053.005 technique.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - After establishing persistence, the malware is likely to gather credentials to further its objectives. The T1552.006 technique indicates that Group Policy Preferences can be a source of credentials.
   - **Accessing Outlook Information:**
     - Once the malware has gathered the necessary credentials, it can use them to access the victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the related TTPs. The malware first establishes persistence, then gathers credentials, and finally uses those credentials to access Outlook information.
