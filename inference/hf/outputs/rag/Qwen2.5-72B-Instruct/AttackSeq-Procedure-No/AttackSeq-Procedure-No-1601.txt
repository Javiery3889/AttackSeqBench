### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether MuddyWater, after exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access, will only then use command and control (C2) servers in Pakistan and China to host malicious code and communicate with compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. This can include using different servers or communication methods at different stages of the attack.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system, allowing for both sending commands and receiving data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This is the initial step where MuddyWater gains access to the target system by exploiting the vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This suggests that MuddyWater may use multiple stages of communication, which implies that they might not limit themselves to just one set of C2 servers. They could use different servers at different stages of the attack to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This indicates that the communication between the attacker and the compromised system is not one-way but bidirectional, which is consistent with the use of multiple C2 servers.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the use of multi-stage channels (T1104), it is unlikely that MuddyWater would limit themselves to only using C2 servers in Pakistan and China. They might use a variety of servers in different locations to ensure robust communication and to make it harder for defenders to disrupt their operations.
   - The bidirectional communication (T1102.002) further supports the idea of using multiple C2 servers to maintain control over the compromised systems.

### Final Answer:
B: No
