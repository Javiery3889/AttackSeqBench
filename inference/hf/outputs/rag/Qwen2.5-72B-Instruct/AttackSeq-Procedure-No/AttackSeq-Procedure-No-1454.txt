### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase after sending emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT during the Initial Access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT:**
     - This technique involves using scripting languages like AutoHotKey and AutoIT to execute commands or scripts. This is typically used during the Execution phase to run malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:**
     - This technique involves the use of malware to gather resources, such as credentials, tools, or other assets that can be used in subsequent phases of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT. This is a common method for initial access, often used to trick users into clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious file.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The Resource Development phase involves gathering resources that can be used in further stages of the attack. The related TTP (T1587.001-Malware) suggests that the use of malware is a common technique during this phase.
   - **Custom Malware (Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor):**
     - Custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor can be used to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities. These tools are often deployed after initial access to gather more resources and prepare for further attacks.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the Resource Development phase involves the use of malware to gather resources, and custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor are commonly used for such purposes, it is plausible that the adversary will use these custom malware tools during the Resource Development phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
