### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 is likely to have used valid account information (such as VPN credentials) to remotely access victim networks after obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**
   - These TTPs indicate that APT15 has a strong preference for using valid account information to achieve various objectives, including defense evasion, persistence, and initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT15 is likely to use valid account information (such as VPN credentials) to remotely access victim networks.
     - Given the related TTPs, APT15 has a history of using valid accounts for various purposes, including initial access and persistence. This aligns with the scenario where they have already obtained domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT15 is unlikely to use valid account information and would instead deploy backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     - While APT15 has been known to use backdoors, the related TTPs emphasize the use of valid accounts, which suggests that they would likely use the valid account information they have already obtained.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, it is more plausible that APT15 would use valid account information to remotely access victim networks, given that they have already obtained domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
