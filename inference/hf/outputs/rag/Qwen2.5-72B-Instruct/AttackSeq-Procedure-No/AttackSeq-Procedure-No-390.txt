### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will use a VBA script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, after using AtomBombing for code injection and execution via legitimate programs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a template file, which can then be used to execute the code when the template is opened.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) scripts to execute malicious code. VBA scripts are commonly used in Office documents like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **AtomBombing:**
     - AtomBombing is a code injection technique that leverages the Windows operating system's atom tables to inject code into a process. It is typically used to execute malicious code in the context of a legitimate process.
   - **VBA Script in a Word Document:**
     - VBA scripts are often used in social engineering attacks where a user is tricked into opening a malicious document. Once the document is opened, the VBA script can execute and perform various actions, including downloading and executing additional payloads.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Initial Infection:**
       - Threat actors use AtomBombing to inject and execute malicious code in a legitimate process. This is a sophisticated technique that can help evade detection.
     - **Subsequent Actions:**
       - After gaining initial access and executing the injected code, threat actors might use additional techniques to maintain persistence, spread laterally, or exfiltrate data.
     - **Use of VBA Script:**
       - While AtomBombing is used for initial code injection, VBA scripts in Word documents are often used for initial access or as part of a multi-stage attack. They can be used to deliver the payload that initiates the AtomBombing technique or to perform additional actions after the initial infection.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that threat actors might use a VBA script in a Word document as part of their strategy, especially if they are trying to achieve initial access or to deliver the payload that will later use AtomBombing. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence after AtomBombing has been used.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the question asks about the likelihood of using a VBA script after AtomBombing, it is less likely that the threat actors would use a VBA script in a Word document immediately after using AtomBombing. AtomBombing is typically used for code injection and execution, and the subsequent actions might involve more sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence or spread laterally.

### Final Answer: B: No
