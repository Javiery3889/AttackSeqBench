### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Charming Kitten, after the Reconnaissance phase, is likely to create fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials only during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves creating or compromising email accounts to support future operations.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves creating or compromising social media accounts to support future operations.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate entities to gain access to systems or information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists. This aligns with the T1656-Impersonation technique, which is typically used in the Reconnaissance phase to gather information and establish initial contact.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The Resource Development phase involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as creating or compromising email and social media accounts (T1585.002 and T1585.001).
     - Creating fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials is a method to gather additional resources, which fits well within the Resource Development phase.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question (Reconnaissance followed by Resource Development) is logical and aligns with the typical attack lifecycle. After gathering initial information, the attackers would likely use that information to create fake websites to obtain more credentials, which are then used in subsequent phases of the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that Charming Kitten would create fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
