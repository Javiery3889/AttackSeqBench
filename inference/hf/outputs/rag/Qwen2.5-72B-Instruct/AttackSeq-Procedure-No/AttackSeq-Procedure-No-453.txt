### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT-TOCS is likely to exhibit lateral movement through network projection after using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used for various purposes, including downloading and running malicious scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell for Command and Control:**
     - APT-TOCS uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control operations. This indicates that the group is already using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which is a common technique for maintaining control over a compromised system.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The related TTP T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) suggests that the group is likely to transfer tools or files to other systems within the network. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to move laterally and gain access to additional systems.
   - **Network Projection:**
     - Network projection is a term that can be interpreted as the act of extending the attacker's presence within the network. Given that APT-TOCS is already using PowerShell for command and control and is likely to transfer tools, it is reasonable to assume that they will use these tools to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of the attack sequence, it is likely that APT-TOCS will exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
