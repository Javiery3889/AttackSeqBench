### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NanHaiShu is likely to communicate between compromised hosts and their command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTP POST requests before using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.
   - The key points are:
     - Gathering system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, and Proxy Server).
     - Communication with C2 servers.
     - Using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data from a target network to an external adversary-controlled server using the same channel that was used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries attempting to get information about the system and its configuration, which can include the system name, IP address, and other details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that NanHaiShu communicates with C2 servers via HTTP POST requests and then uses HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.
     - This aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves exfiltration over the C2 channel.
     - The T1082 technique confirms that the malware gathers system information, which is consistent with the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that NanHaiShu does not communicate with C2 servers via HTTP POST requests before using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.
     - This does not align with the T1041 technique, which explicitly mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel using HTTP POST.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that NanHaiShu is likely to communicate with C2 servers via HTTP POST requests before using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
