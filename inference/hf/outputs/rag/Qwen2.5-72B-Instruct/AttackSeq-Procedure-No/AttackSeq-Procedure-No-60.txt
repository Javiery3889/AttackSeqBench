### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot:**
     - This technique involves an adversary restarting a system in safe mode to evade detection. Safe mode typically loads a minimal set of drivers and services, which can help the adversary avoid detection by security products.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves an adversary collecting information about the victim's system, including operating system details and installed security products. This information can be used to tailor further attacks or to understand the environment better.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro will restart the machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting system information.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Restarting in safe mode (T1562.009) is a common technique used to evade detection by security products.
       - After evading detection, the adversary would then proceed to collect system information (T1082) to understand the environment better.
       - This sequence is logical and aligns with the tactics of evading detection before performing further reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro will not restart the machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting system information.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - If the adversary does not restart in safe mode, they might be more likely to be detected by security products.
       - However, this does not mean it is impossible, but it is less likely given the context of the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is more plausible that Grandoreiro will restart the machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
