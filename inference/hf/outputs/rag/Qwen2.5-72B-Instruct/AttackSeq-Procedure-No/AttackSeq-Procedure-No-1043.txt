### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PKPLUG is likely to achieve persistence by using DLL side-loading after delivering payloads via spear-phishing emails that exploit vulnerable Microsoft Office applications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence**
   - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - DLL side-loading is a technique where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, causing the legitimate application to load and execute the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Emails:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common initial attack vector used to deliver payloads. These emails often contain malicious attachments or links that exploit vulnerabilities in applications like Microsoft Office.
   - **Exploiting Vulnerable Microsoft Office Applications:**
     - Once the user opens the malicious attachment or link, the payload is delivered and executed, often leveraging vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to gain initial access.
   - **DLL Side-Loading:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker might use DLL side-loading to achieve persistence. This involves replacing a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, ensuring that the malicious code is executed every time the legitimate application runs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker uses spear-phishing emails to deliver a payload that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
     2. **Execution:** The payload is executed, allowing the attacker to gain a foothold in the system.
     3. **Persistence:** To maintain access, the attacker uses DLL side-loading to ensure that the malicious code is executed persistently.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, the answer is that PKPLUG is likely to achieve persistence by employing DLL side-loading after using spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads through exploiting vulnerable Microsoft Office applications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
