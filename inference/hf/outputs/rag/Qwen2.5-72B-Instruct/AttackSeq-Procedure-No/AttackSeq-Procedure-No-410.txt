### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the "Machete" malware:
     - Initial access through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites.
     - Distribution of self-extracting archives disguised as PowerPoint presentations.
     - Achieving persistence by exploiting search order hijacking vulnerabilities.
     - Collecting sensitive information through keystroke logging, microphone audio capture, and screenshot taking.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1123-Audio Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing audio from the victim's microphone.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one, achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites, which is a common method for distributing malware.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question asks if the malware will achieve persistence by exploiting search order hijacking vulnerabilities. The related TTP (T1574.001) confirms that this is a valid technique for achieving persistence.
   - **Collection:**
     - The question mentions logging keystrokes, capturing microphone audio, and taking screenshots. The related TTP (T1123) confirms that capturing audio is a valid technique for collection.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical:
     - **Initial Access:** The malware gains access through spear-phishing and fake websites.
     - **Persistence:** The malware then achieves persistence using DLL search order hijacking.
     - **Collection:** Finally, the malware collects sensitive information through various methods, including audio capture.

### Final Answer:
Given the logical sequence and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
