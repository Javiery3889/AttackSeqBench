### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware:
     - Discovers system information using the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.
     - Sends the information to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.
     - Encrypts C2 (Command and Control) data.
     - Converts the encrypted data into a hexadecimal representation.
     - Encodes the hexadecimal data into base64.
     - Contacts the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to network defenses.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, making it harder to detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Encryption and Encoding:**
     - The question mentions encrypting C2 data, converting it to hexadecimal, and then encoding it in base64. This is a common practice in advanced malware to obfuscate and protect the data being exfiltrated.
   - **Standard Encoding (T1132.001):**
     - This technique specifically mentions standard encoding methods, which can include base64 encoding.
   - **Data Encoding (T1132):**
     - This broader technique includes various methods of encoding data, which aligns with the steps described in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (encrypting, converting to hexadecimal, and encoding in base64) is a plausible and common method for obfuscating and protecting C2 data.
   - The related TTPs (T1132.001 and T1132) support the use of encoding techniques, which aligns with the steps mentioned in the question.
