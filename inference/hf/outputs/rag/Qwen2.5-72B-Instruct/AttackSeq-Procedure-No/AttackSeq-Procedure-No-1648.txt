### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro.
   - The VBA macro is expected to use a COM object to gather system information.
   - The malware is then expected to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.001-Component Object Model:** This technique involves using COM objects to execute commands or gather information.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document and an auto-open VBA macro is a common initial access technique (T1566.002-Phishing with Attachment).
   - **Execution of VBA Macro:** The VBA macro can indeed use COM objects to gather system information (T1559.001-Component Object Model). This is a plausible step as the attacker would want to gather information about the system to tailor further actions.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:** After gathering system information, the malware can establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours (T1053.005-Scheduled Task). This is a common technique to ensure the malware runs periodically.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The VBA macro can use a COM object to gather system information, and the malware can then create a scheduled task to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
