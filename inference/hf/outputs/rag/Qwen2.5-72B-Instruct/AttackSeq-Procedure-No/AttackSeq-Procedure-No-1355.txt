### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideWinder APT group:
     - Initial access via CVE-2019-2215 through malicious apps on Google Play.
     - Use of obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.
     - Exploitation of CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system. In this case, CVE-2019-2215 is a vulnerability in the Android WebView component, which can be exploited through malicious apps.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalvation:**
     - This technique involves using vulnerabilities to gain higher-level permissions on a system. CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU are both vulnerabilities that can be exploited for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play aligns with T1190.
   - **Evasion:**
     - Obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation are common techniques used by APT groups to evade detection. These techniques are not explicitly listed in the related TTPs, but they are widely used in the context of APT activities.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The use of CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU for privilege escalation aligns with T1068.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the SideWinder APT group employed techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection before using exploits for privilege escalation. The sequence described in the question is consistent with the tactics and techniques used by APT groups.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
