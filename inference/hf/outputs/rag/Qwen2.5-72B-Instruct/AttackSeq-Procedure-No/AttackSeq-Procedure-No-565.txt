### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts to acquire infrastructure only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves registering or acquiring domains for future use in various stages of an attack.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party software update mechanism to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique is similar to T1584.001 and involves acquiring domains for future use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1584.001-Domains and T1583.001-Domains** are both part of the Resource Development tactic and involve acquiring domains for future use. These techniques are typically used in the early stages of an attack to prepare the necessary infrastructure.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** is part of the Initial Access tactic and involves using a compromised software update to gain initial access to a target network. This technique is typically used after the necessary infrastructure (such as domains) has been acquired.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where the attackers park domains for future use only after using a compromised software update for initial access. However, this sequence is unlikely because:
     - **Resource Development** (acquiring domains) is typically done before the **Initial Access** stage to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place.
     - It would be more logical for attackers to acquire domains as part of their Resource Development efforts before they use a compromised software update for initial access.

### Final Answer:
B: No
