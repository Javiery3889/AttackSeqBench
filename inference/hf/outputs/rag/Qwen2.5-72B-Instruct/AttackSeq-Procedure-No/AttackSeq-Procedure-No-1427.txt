### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a spyware, after performing keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`, will extract Chrome passwords for Credential Access by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**
   - This TTP indicates that the technique involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which is consistent with the idea of extracting Chrome passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging for Collection:**
     - Keylogging is a common technique used to capture keystrokes, which can include passwords and other sensitive information. This is part of the Collection tactic.
   - **Extracting Chrome Passwords:**
     - Extracting Chrome passwords involves accessing the SQLite databases where Chrome stores user credentials. This is a specific technique under the Credential Access tactic, specifically T1555.003.
   - **Use of `libCache32.exe` and `libchrome.exe`:**
     - `libCache32.exe` is used for keylogging, which aligns with the Collection tactic.
     - `libchrome.exe` is used to query Chrome's SQLite databases, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the spyware has already performed keylogging for Collection, it is plausible that the next step in the attack sequence would be to extract Chrome passwords for Credential Access. The use of `libchrome.exe` to query Chrome's SQLite databases is consistent with the T1555.003 technique.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
