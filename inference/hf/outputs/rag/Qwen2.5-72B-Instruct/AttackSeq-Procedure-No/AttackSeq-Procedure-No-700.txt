### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use email for command and control (C2) via an Office macro after achieving persistence through the creation and importing of OS-specific registry entries using the CT/NewCT implant.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves the use of email accounts to facilitate various stages of the attack, including reconnaissance, initial access, and possibly C2.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Entries:**
     - The question mentions that persistence is achieved through the creation and importing of OS-specific registry entries using the CT/NewCT implant. This is a common method for maintaining access to a system.
   - **Email for C2:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that email accounts and mail protocols are used for C2. This suggests that using email for C2 is a plausible method.
   - **Office Macro:**
     - The question specifically asks about using an Office macro for C2. While Office macros can be used for C2, the related TTPs do not explicitly mention the use of Office macros. However, Office macros are a known method for executing malicious code and can be used to establish C2.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that Moafee and DragonOK could use email for C2. The use of Office macros for C2 is also a known technique, even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that they will use email for C2 via an Office macro. The related TTPs support the use of email for C2, but the specific use of an Office macro is not directly supported by the given TTPs.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The related TTPs support the use of email for C2, but they do not specifically mention the use of an Office macro for this purpose. Therefore, it is not likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use email for C2 via an Office macro based on the given information.
