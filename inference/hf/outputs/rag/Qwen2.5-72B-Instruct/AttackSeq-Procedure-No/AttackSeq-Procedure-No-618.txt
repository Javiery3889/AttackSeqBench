### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Hidden Cobra targets Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will create profile pages in Microsoft TechNet to use as C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, a Word document) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious content to gain initial access to the target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing emails with malicious Word documents to gain initial access and execute code on the target system.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The question asks about the likelihood of Hidden Cobra creating profile pages in Microsoft TechNet for C2 infrastructure. This falls under the Resource Development tactic, which involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support the attack.
     - While Hidden Cobra is known to use various methods for C2, the specific technique of creating profile pages in Microsoft TechNet is not a common or well-documented method for C2 infrastructure.
     - Typically, C2 infrastructure involves more traditional methods such as domain fronting, using legitimate cloud services, or setting up their own servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that Hidden Cobra will create profile pages in Microsoft TechNet for C2 infrastructure. The related TTPs do not support this specific method, and it is not a common or documented technique for C2.

**Final Answer: B: No**
