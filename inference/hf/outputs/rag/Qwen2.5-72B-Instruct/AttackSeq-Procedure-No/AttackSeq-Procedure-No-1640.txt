### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will clone victim user Git repositories before exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services after leveraging built-in lateral movement capabilities in Cobalt Strike.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.003 - Code Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from code repositories, such as Git.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.001 - Exfiltration to Code Repository:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213 - Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from various information repositories, which can include code repositories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will clone victim user Git repositories before exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services.
     - The related TTPs indicate that collecting data from code repositories (T1213.003) and exfiltrating data to code repositories (T1567.001) are both relevant techniques.
     - However, the question specifically mentions exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services, not code repositories.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will not clone victim user Git repositories before exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services.
     - The related TTPs do not explicitly mention exfiltration to cloud storage web services, but they do mention exfiltration to code repositories (T1567.001).
     - Given that the question specifies cloud storage web services, it is more likely that the adversary would use a different method for exfiltration, such as cloud storage services, rather than cloning Git repositories.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific mention of cloud storage web services in the question, it is more plausible that the adversary will not clone victim user Git repositories before exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services.

**Final Answer: B: No**
