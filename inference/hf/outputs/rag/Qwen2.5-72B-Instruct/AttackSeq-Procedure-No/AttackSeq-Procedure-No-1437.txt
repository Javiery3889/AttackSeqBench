### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment after accessing data from Information Repositories.
   - The context is the StellarParticle campaign, which involved discovery activities using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using domain accounts, which can be either privileged or non-privileged, to gain higher levels of access.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally through the network, which can be done with both privileged and non-privileged accounts, though privileged accounts are more powerful.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The threat actor used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to discover Active Directory information. This suggests that they were gathering information to identify potential targets and access points.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The use of domain accounts (T1078.002) indicates that the threat actor likely attempted to escalate privileges to gain more access. This is a common step after initial discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The use of RDP (T1021.001) for lateral movement is a logical next step after privilege escalation. The threat actor would use both privileged and non-privileged accounts to move through the environment, depending on the level of access required for each target.
   - **Accessing Data from Information Repositories:**
     - The question mentions that the threat actor accessed data from Information Repositories before moving laterally. This suggests that they needed to gather sensitive information before expanding their control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of activities described (discovery, privilege escalation, accessing data, and lateral movement), it is plausible that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment after accessing data from Information Repositories.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
