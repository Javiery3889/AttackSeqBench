### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Earth Lusca, after establishing persistence through account manipulation and scheduled tasks, is likely to use Tor and VPN servers to obfuscate their command and control (C2) activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to further obfuscate the origin of the traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **T1090-Proxy:** Using a proxy to route traffic can help obfuscate the origin of the traffic, which aligns with the use of Tor and VPN servers.
     - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** Using multiple proxies, including Tor and VPN servers, can further enhance obfuscation and make it harder to trace the C2 traffic.
     - **T1071.004-DNS:** While DNS can be used for C2, it is not directly related to the use of Tor and VPN servers, but it can be used in conjunction with them.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Earth Lusca does not use Tor and VPN servers for C2. However, the related TTPs (T1090-Proxy and T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy) strongly indicate that obfuscation techniques, including the use of proxies, are part of their C2 strategy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, particularly T1090-Proxy and T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy, it is highly likely that Earth Lusca would use Tor and VPN servers to obfuscate their C2 activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
