### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests before performing initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system's network configuration, including IP addresses and network adapter details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves the use of multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This sub-technique is a specific method of discovering whether the system has an active internet connection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests before performing initial reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests before performing initial reconnaissance.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Communication with Control Servers (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels):**
     - The Rising Sun implant is likely to establish a communication channel with the control servers to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data. HTTP POST requests are a common method for this communication.
   - **Initial Reconnaissance (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery):**
     - Before performing any significant actions, the implant would typically gather information about the system's network configuration and check for an active internet connection. This is crucial for ensuring that the implant can communicate with the control servers effectively.

   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The logical sequence would be:
       1. Ensure persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
       2. Establish communication with the control servers using HTTP POST requests.
       3. Perform initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests before performing initial reconnaissance.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
