### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network for lateral movement after performing internal reconnaissance.
   - The key points are:
     - Internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware.
     - Use of software deployment tools for lateral movement.
     - Movement of AvosLocker and other tools.
     - Collecting data from network shared drives.
     - Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate tools to transfer tools or files across the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools (like PDQ Deploy) to move tools and malware across the network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the network, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after reconnaissance.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** and **T1072-Software Deployment Tools** both indicate that using software deployment tools for lateral movement is a common technique.
       - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** aligns with the reconnaissance phase, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 will not use software deployment tools for lateral movement.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that using such tools is a common technique for lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of the attack, the most plausible answer is that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after performing internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
