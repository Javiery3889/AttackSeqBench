### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether MuddyWater APT group used AnyDesk (a remote desktop application) to gain access to the compromised network before using a server-based script (web.py) to process client requests and deliver next-stage payloads.
   - The time frame mentioned is from February to April 2019, during the initial access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1219-Remote Access Software:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate remote access software, such as AnyDesk, to maintain persistence and command and control (C2) over the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services, such as RDP or SSH, to gain initial access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that MuddyWater APT group used AnyDesk to gain access to the network before using the web.py script.
     - **T1219-Remote Access Software** supports the use of AnyDesk for maintaining access and C2.
     - However, the question specifically asks about the initial access phase, and T1219 is more commonly associated with the Command and Control phase rather than the Initial Access phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that MuddyWater APT group did not use AnyDesk to gain initial access to the network.
     - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** and **T1133-External Remote Services** are more aligned with the initial access phase.
     - These techniques are commonly used by APT groups to gain initial access, and it is plausible that MuddyWater used one of these methods before employing AnyDesk for C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the initial access phase, it is more likely that MuddyWater APT group used techniques like T1190 or T1133 to gain initial access before employing AnyDesk for C2 and web.py for further operations.

**Final Answer: B: No**
