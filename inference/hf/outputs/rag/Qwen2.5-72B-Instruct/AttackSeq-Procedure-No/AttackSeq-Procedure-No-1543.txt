### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malware will perform discovery (obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process) only after achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry, following the establishment of command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - These TTPs indicate that the malware is using the Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder technique for both privilege escalation and persistence. This technique involves creating or modifying registry keys to ensure that the malware runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Command and Control (C2):** The malware has already established C2 through Process Hollowing, which is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Achieving Persistence:** The malware creates a RunOnce key in the registry to ensure it runs at system startup, which is a common persistence mechanism.
   - **Discovery:** The question asks if the malware will perform discovery (obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process) only after achieving persistence.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **C2 Establishment:** The malware needs to establish C2 first to receive further instructions from the attacker.
     - **Persistence:** Once C2 is established, the malware might achieve persistence to ensure it can continue to operate even if the system is restarted.
     - **Discovery:** After achieving persistence, the malware can then perform discovery to gather information about the system and the user. This is a logical step because the malware needs to understand the environment it is operating in to carry out further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, it is plausible that the malware will perform discovery after achieving persistence. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
