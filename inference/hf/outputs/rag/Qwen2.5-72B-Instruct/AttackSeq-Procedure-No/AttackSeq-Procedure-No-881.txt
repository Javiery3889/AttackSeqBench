### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor is likely to gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase only after it has completed the Collection phase activities (creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the hostname, operating system version, and other system-specific details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The Collection phase involves gathering data from the system, which can include creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment better. This can include techniques like T1016 and T1082.
   - **Sequence of Activities:** The question implies a sequence where the backdoor first performs Collection activities and then moves to Discovery activities. However, in many real-world scenarios, attackers often perform Discovery activities early in the attack to understand the environment before engaging in more specific Collection activities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - It is common for attackers to perform Discovery activities early in the attack to gather information about the system and network. This information is crucial for planning further actions, such as identifying valuable data to collect or determining the best methods for exfiltration.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the Aria-body backdoor would wait until after the Collection phase to perform Discovery activities. Instead, it is more plausible that the Discovery phase activities (T1016 and T1082) would occur before or concurrently with the Collection phase activities.

### Final Answer: B: No
