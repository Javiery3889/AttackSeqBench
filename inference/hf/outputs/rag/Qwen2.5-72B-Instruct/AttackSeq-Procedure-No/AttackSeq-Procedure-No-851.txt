### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dexphot, after using SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader for obfuscation, is likely to ensure persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using techniques such as Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the malware uses scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the malware uses scheduled tasks to execute its payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader:** This is a software bundler that can be used to obfuscate files or information, which is a common defense evasion tactic.
   - **Dexphot:** This is a known malware that has been observed using various persistence mechanisms, including scheduled tasks.
   - **Dual Monitoring Services and Scheduled Tasks:** This suggests that the malware is using multiple methods to ensure it remains active on the system.
   - **Scheduled Task (T1053.005):** This technique is explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, indicating that it is a key method used by the malware for persistence and execution.
   - **Signed Binary Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using legitimate, signed binaries to execute malicious code, which is another common persistence and execution method.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Dexphot is known to use scheduled tasks for persistence and execution, and the related TTPs specifically mention T1053.005 (Scheduled Task), it is highly likely that Dexphot would use this technique after obfuscating its files.
   - The question also mentions "dual monitoring services," which suggests that Dexphot might use multiple methods to ensure persistence, including scheduled tasks and possibly other techniques like signed binary proxy execution.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
