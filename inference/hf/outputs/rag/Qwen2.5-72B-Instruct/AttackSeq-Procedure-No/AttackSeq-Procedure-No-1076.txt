### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Tropic Trooper used social media channels to spearphish victims before dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique involves using social media or other online services to send targeted spearphishing messages to victims.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Exploitation (T1203):** The question states that Tropic Trooper exploited either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1203 technique.
   - **Malicious File (T1204.002):** After gaining initial access, the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe). This aligns with the T1204.002 technique.
   - **Spearphishing via Service (T1566.003):** The question asks if social media channels were used to spearphish victims before the backdoor installer was dropped. This aligns with the T1566.003 technique.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) to gain initial access.
     2. Use social media channels to spearphish victims.
     3. Drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).

   - However, the related TTPs suggest that the exploitation (T1203) and the malicious file (T1204.002) are directly linked, and the spearphishing via service (T1566.003) is a separate initial access technique.

   - Given that the exploitation (T1203) is already used to gain initial access, it is less likely that social media spearphishing (T1566.003) would be used as a subsequent step in the same attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
B: No
