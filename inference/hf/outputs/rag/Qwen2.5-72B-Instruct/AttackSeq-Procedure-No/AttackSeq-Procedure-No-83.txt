### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Vyveva will compress files with zlib for collection during the Collection tactic after exfiltrating data to its C&C server over the communication channel via Tor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving files using a library, such as zlib, to reduce the size of the data before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data to a C2 (Command and Control) server over a communication channel, which in this case is via Tor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question states that data has already been exfiltrated to the C&C server via Tor.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that files were compressed with zlib during the Collection phase.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - Compression (T1560.002) typically occurs before exfiltration to reduce the size of the data being sent.
     - Since the exfiltration has already occurred, it is unlikely that the compression would happen after the data has already been sent.
   - **TTPs Context:**
     - T1560.002 (Archive via Library) is a technique used during the Collection phase to prepare data for exfiltration.
     - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is a technique used during the Exfiltration phase to send the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the exfiltration has already occurred, it is not likely that the files were compressed with zlib for collection after the exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
