### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Elfin exfiltrated data over Google Drive after establishing command and control using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which includes services like Google Drive.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin did exfiltrate data over Google Drive.
     - The related TTP T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage directly supports this possibility, as it indicates that exfiltration to cloud storage services, including Google Drive, is a known technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin did not exfiltrate data over Google Drive.
     - While it is possible that Elfin used other methods for exfiltration, the presence of T1567.002 in the related TTPs makes this choice less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTP T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage, it is plausible that Elfin used Google Drive for data exfiltration after establishing command and control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
