### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Agrius is likely to use "pass the ticket" for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP after exploiting a public-facing application.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that Agrius exploits a public-facing application (CVE-2018-13379) to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question asks if Agrius is likely to use "pass the ticket" for lateral movement. "Pass the ticket" (T1550.002) is a technique where attackers use stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within a network.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question mentions that Agrius uses the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP to communicate with C2 servers. This aligns with the T1071.001 technique.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Agrius gains initial access via T1190.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question does not provide specific evidence that Agrius uses "pass the ticket" for lateral movement. While it is a common technique, it is not mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Agrius communicates with C2 servers using T1071.001.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (exploit public-facing application, use pass the ticket, communicate with C2) is not fully supported by the related TTPs. The related TTPs only mention initial access and command and control, but not lateral movement using "pass the ticket."

### Final Answer: B: No
