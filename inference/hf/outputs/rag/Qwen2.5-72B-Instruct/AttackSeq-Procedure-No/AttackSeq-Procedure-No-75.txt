### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will only gather information about the infected computer (system and user names) after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents, and then transmit the data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include various types of data such as files, keystrokes, and other system information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to understand the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Collection of Keystrokes, Directory Listings, and HWP Documents:**
       - This aligns with the **Collection** tactic and the **T1005-Data from Local System** technique. The malware is gathering specific types of data from the local system.
     - **Gathering Information about the Infected Computer (System and User Names):**
       - This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic and the **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** technique. However, the question specifically mentions gathering system and user names, which is more aligned with the **T1082-System Information Discovery** technique.
     - **Transmitting Data through Encrypted Emails:**
       - This aligns with the **Exfiltration** tactic, where the collected data is sent to the attackers.

   - **Plausibility of the Sequence:**
     - Typically, malware will first perform discovery to understand the environment (e.g., system and user names) before collecting specific data. This is because the discovery phase helps the malware determine what data to collect and how to exfiltrate it.
     - The sequence described in the question (collecting specific data first and then discovering system information) is less common and less logical. It is more likely that the malware would first discover the system information and then proceed to collect specific data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. The malware is more likely to perform discovery first and then collect specific data.

**Final Answer: B: No**
