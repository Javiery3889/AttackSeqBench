### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the app will send gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device, following the use of FTP for Command and Control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2, such as FTP, HTTP, or SMTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FTP for Command and Control:**
     - The question states that the app uses FTP for Command and Control operations. This aligns with the T1071.001 technique, which mentions web protocols, but FTP is also a valid protocol for C2.
   - **Exfiltration Over HTTP:**
     - The question then asks if the app sends gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. This aligns with the T1048.003 technique, which involves exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question is:
       1. Use FTP for Command and Control.
       2. Perform routines on the iOS device.
       3. Send gathered information via HTTP.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - FTP can be used for C2 to receive commands.
       - The app can then perform routines (e.g., data collection) on the device.
       - Finally, the app can exfiltrate the gathered data using HTTP, which is an unencrypted protocol and not typically used for C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
