### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Iranian hackers sent "consent phishing" emails containing malicious links designed to steal usersâ€™ access tokens before attempting to gain initial access via social media platforms and spear-phishing messages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending emails to victims to trick them into performing an action, such as clicking a link or opening an attachment.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that lead to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Consent Phishing:** Consent phishing is a specific type of phishing attack where attackers trick users into granting permissions to malicious applications, often by masquerading as legitimate services. This can be used to steal access tokens.
   - **Spear-Phishing Link:** This involves sending targeted emails with links that lead to malicious content, which can be used to deliver malware or steal credentials.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Consent Phishing:** This can be an initial step to gain access to user accounts by stealing access tokens.
     - **Spear-Phishing via Social Media:** This can be a subsequent step to further compromise the target or to spread the attack.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - It is plausible that Iranian hackers would use consent phishing as an initial step to gain access to user accounts by stealing access tokens. Once they have the access tokens, they can use them to gain deeper access or to send more targeted spear-phishing messages via social media platforms.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that phishing and spear-phishing are common initial access techniques, and consent phishing can be a specific form of phishing used to steal access tokens.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
