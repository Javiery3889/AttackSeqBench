### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus Group is likely to collect information about accounts using the "net user" utility only after using tools like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance.
   - The key points are:
     - Escalating privileges by creating local administrator accounts.
     - Using `net user` to collect information about accounts.
     - Using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about local accounts on a system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.002-Domain Account:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about domain accounts on a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance with `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`:**
     - These tools are typically used to gather network information, such as IP addresses and network connectivity.
     - They are part of the initial reconnaissance phase to understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **Using `net user` to collect account information:**
     - The `net user` command is used to display information about local and domain accounts.
     - This is a more targeted form of reconnaissance, focusing on account details rather than network topology.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is logical for an attacker to first use `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` to understand the network environment.
     - After gaining a basic understanding of the network, the attacker would then use `net user` to gather more specific information about accounts, which can be useful for further privilege escalation or lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Lazarus Group would use `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for initial reconnaissance before using `net user` to collect account information.
   - Therefore, the answer is: **B: No**.

Final Answer: B: No
