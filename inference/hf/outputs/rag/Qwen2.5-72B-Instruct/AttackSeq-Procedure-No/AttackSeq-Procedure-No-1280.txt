### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence through services or the Run registry key, after using DLL Side-Loading with legitimate executables to load malicious DLLs during initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence**
   - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - DLL Side-Loading involves using a legitimate executable to load a malicious DLL, which can be used for initial access or to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):**
     - This technique is often used to gain initial access or to maintain persistence by leveraging trusted executables to load malicious code.
   - **Persistence through Services or Run Registry Key:**
     - These are common methods for establishing persistence. Services can be configured to start automatically, and the Run registry key can be used to ensure that a malicious program runs at system startup.
   - **Connecting to IPC$ Share:**
     - The IPC$ share is a network share used for inter-process communication. Connecting to the IPC$ share is often a precursor to lateral movement, where an attacker might attempt to access and control other machines on the network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access using DLL Side-Loading, APT10 would likely focus on establishing persistence to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system. This is a critical step to ensure they can continue their operations even if the initial access vector is discovered or removed.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Connecting to the IPC$ share is typically a step taken after establishing persistence, as it is part of the lateral movement phase. This allows the attacker to move to other systems on the network and potentially spread the infection.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The logical sequence of actions for APT10 would be:
       1. Gain initial access using DLL Side-Loading.
       2. Establish persistence through methods like services or the Run registry key.
       3. Perform lateral movement by connecting to the IPC$ share on remote machines.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical attack sequence and the related TTPs, it is more likely that APT10 will establish persistence before connecting to the IPC$ share on remote machines.

### Final Answer: B: No
