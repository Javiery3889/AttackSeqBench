### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence starts with gaining Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - It then asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would use `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - Finally, it asks if this would be followed by acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access**
     - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
   - This TTP confirms that the initial access is gained by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which aligns with the first part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that FamousSparrow gains initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Using `cmd.exe` to Download and Install SparrowDoor:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for threat actors to use command-line tools like `cmd.exe` to download and install additional malware or backdoors. This is a typical post-exploitation step.
   - **Acquiring Infrastructure for Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development is a separate tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves establishing and maintaining the infrastructure needed to support operations. This typically happens before or in parallel with the initial access and post-exploitation activities.
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the resource development (acquiring infrastructure) happens after the initial access and backdoor installation, which is less common but not impossible.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible but not the most common or logical order of operations.
   - Typically, resource development (acquiring infrastructure) would happen before or in parallel with the initial access and post-exploitation activities.
   - However, the question does not explicitly state that the resource development must happen before the initial access, so it is still possible, albeit less likely.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described is less likely because resource development (acquiring infrastructure) is typically a preparatory step that happens before or in parallel with initial access and post-exploitation activities.
