### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious macro in a .xlsm file executes a PowerShell script (WINDOWSTEMP.ps1). It then asks whether it is likely that the backdoor program will use ListPlanting to inject code into a trusted process before gathering host information through evasion techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.015-ListPlanting:** This technique involves injecting code into a trusted process by manipulating the list of loaded modules or threads.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This is a broader category that includes various methods of injecting code into a process, including ListPlanting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor program will use ListPlanting to inject code into a trusted process before gathering host information through evasion techniques.
     - Given the related TTPs, ListPlanting (T1055.015) is a specific method of process injection (T1055) that is used for defense evasion. It is plausible that after the PowerShell script is executed, the backdoor program might use ListPlanting to inject code into a trusted process to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor program will not use ListPlanting to inject code into a trusted process before gathering host information through evasion techniques.
     - This choice is less likely given the related TTPs, as ListPlanting is a known technique for defense evasion and is often used in such scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely answer is that the backdoor program will use ListPlanting to inject code into a trusted process before gathering host information through evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
