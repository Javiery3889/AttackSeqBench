### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Raccoon stealer:
     - Communicating with C&C servers using Telegram features.
     - Collecting system and account information as well as crypto wallet data.
     - Making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. It aligns with the idea of using Telegram for C&C communication and receiving encrypted addresses.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C&C communication. This aligns with the idea of collecting and exfiltrating system and account information as well as crypto wallet data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves bidirectional communication between the compromised system and the C&C server. This aligns with the idea of making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is likely.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** supports the use of Telegram for C&C and receiving encrypted addresses.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** supports the collection and exfiltration of data.
       - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** supports the bidirectional communication for receiving encrypted addresses.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is not likely.
     - The related TTPs do not support this choice, as they all align with the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
