### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries use PowerShell to execute the Empire stager, then conceal the execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading, and finally establish persistence by hijacking COM objects.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:**
     - Reflective code loading is a technique where adversaries load and execute code in memory without writing it to disk, which helps in evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:**
     - COM hijacking involves modifying the registry to point to a malicious component, which is then executed when a legitimate application tries to use the hijacked COM object.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Execution of Empire Stager:**
     - This is a common initial step in many attacks, where PowerShell is used to execute a stager (like Empire) to download and execute additional payloads.
   - **Reflective Code Loading:**
     - After the initial execution, adversaries often use reflective code loading to load and execute additional payloads in memory, avoiding detection by security tools that monitor disk activity.
   - **Component Object Model Hijacking:**
     - Once the malicious payload is in memory, adversaries may establish persistence by hijacking COM objects. This ensures that the malicious code is executed every time a specific application or system process is run.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. After using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager, it is logical for adversaries to use reflective code loading to conceal the execution of malicious payloads. Following this, establishing persistence through COM hijacking is a common next step to ensure the malware remains active on the system.
