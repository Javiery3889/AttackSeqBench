### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Elderwood Project attackers will deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks after establishing command and control (C&C) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access**
     - **Technique: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise**
   - **Drive-by Compromise (T1189)** involves placing a malicious script or file on a website that a targeted user is likely to visit. When the user visits the site, the script or file is executed, leading to the compromise of the user's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C&C Servers:**
     - Establishing C&C servers is typically a step that occurs after gaining initial access to a system. The C&C servers are used to maintain control over the compromised systems and to issue commands to the malware.
   - **Initial Access via Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - Watering hole attacks are a method of gaining initial access to a target's network by compromising a website that the target is likely to visit. This is a common technique used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including the Elderwood Project.
   - **Zero-Day Exploits:**
     - Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor and are used to gain unauthorized access to systems. They are often used in the initial access phase to exploit vulnerabilities in the target's systems.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a sequence where C&C servers are established first, and then zero-day exploits are used to gain initial access via watering hole attacks. However, this sequence is not logical because:
     - **Initial Access** must occur before **C&C Server Establishment**. The attackers need to gain access to the target's systems first before they can establish C&C servers.
     - **Watering Hole Attacks** are a method of gaining initial access, and they often involve the use of zero-day exploits to compromise the target's systems.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct sequence should be:
     1. Use zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.
     2. Establish C&C servers to maintain control over the compromised systems.

### Final Answer: B: No
