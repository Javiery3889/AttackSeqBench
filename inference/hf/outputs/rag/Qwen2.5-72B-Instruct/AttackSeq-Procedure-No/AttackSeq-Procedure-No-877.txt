### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands only before the Discovery tactic.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - The use of HTTP and TCP protocols.
     - The timing of these actions in relation to the Discovery tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering detailed system and network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols (Command and Control):**
     - This technique is typically used after the initial compromise to establish a communication channel with the attacker's command and control server.
     - It is used to send collected data and receive additional commands.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery (Discovery):**
     - This technique is used to gather detailed information about the system and network, which is typically done after the initial compromise and before or during the execution of further actions.
   - The question suggests that HTTP and TCP protocols are used only before the Discovery tactic. However, based on the TTPs, HTTP and TCP protocols are more likely to be used during the Command and Control phase, which can occur concurrently with or after the Discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that HTTP and TCP protocols are used for command and control, which typically occurs after or during the Discovery phase, the answer is that the Naikon APT group is not likely to use these protocols only before the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: B: No**
