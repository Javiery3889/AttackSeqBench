### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files.
   - The focus is on the sequence of TTPs, particularly the deployment of data destruction tools before the C2 communication phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data to disrupt or damage the target's operations.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Destruction (T1485):** The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are tools designed to overwrite files, which aligns with the Data Destruction tactic.
   - **File Deletion (T1070.004):** This technique is used to remove evidence of the attack, which is typically done after the main objectives (like data destruction) are achieved.
   - **C2 Communication:** The 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands from C2 servers is a later stage in the attack lifecycle, typically after initial data destruction and file deletion activities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where data destruction tools are deployed before the C2 communication phase.
   - Given the nature of the TTPs, it is logical to deploy data destruction tools (like 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD') before the C2 communication phase to ensure that the target's data is compromised and the attack's impact is maximized.
   - File deletion (T1070.004) is often a post-impact activity to cover tracks, which would follow the data destruction phase.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
