### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will dump the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1003.001 - LSASS Memory**
   - This TTP indicates that the attacker is using a technique to dump the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 will dump the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before performing reconnaissance.
     - Given the related TTP (T1003.001 - LSASS Memory), it is plausible that FIN13 would use this technique to gain credentials.
     - Obtaining credentials is a common first step in many attack sequences, as it allows the attacker to move laterally and perform further actions, such as reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 will not dump the LSASS process memory before performing reconnaissance.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP, as dumping LSASS memory is a common and effective method for obtaining credentials, which are often necessary for further reconnaissance activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the common sequence of attack steps, it is more plausible that FIN13 will dump the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before performing reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
