### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete is likely to collect data by copying files from removable media only after conducting discovery by listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system, which can help them identify potential targets for data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery):**
     - Before collecting data, an adversary typically needs to discover what files and directories are available on the system. This helps them identify which files to target for collection.
   - **Collection (T1025-Data from Removable Media):**
     - Once the adversary has discovered the files and directories, they can then proceed to collect data from removable media. This is a logical next step after discovery.
   - **Listing Nearby Wi-Fi Networks and Enumerating Running Processes:**
     - The question mentions listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes. These are also discovery techniques, but they are not directly related to the collection of data from removable media. They are more likely to be used for network reconnaissance and understanding the system's environment.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes before collecting data from removable media) is not the most logical or common sequence based on the related TTPs.
   - Typically, an adversary would first discover file and directory paths (T1083) and then collect data from removable media (T1025). The other discovery techniques (listing Wi-Fi networks and enumerating processes) are not directly relevant to the collection of data from removable media.

### Final Answer:
B: No
