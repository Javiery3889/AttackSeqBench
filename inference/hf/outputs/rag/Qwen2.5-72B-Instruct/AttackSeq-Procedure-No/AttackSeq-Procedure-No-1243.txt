### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process after gaining initial access via spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 is known to use spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to target networks. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Discovery Process:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT28 typically performs discovery to understand the network environment. This involves techniques like T1082 (System Information Discovery), T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery), and T1049 (Process Discovery).
   - **Geographically Distributed Bots:**
     - The use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server is more commonly associated with botnets and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. While APT28 may use command and control (C2) servers, the specific mention of geographically distributed bots is not a typical characteristic of their discovery process.
   - **Dropper Execution:**
     - APT28 often uses droppers to deploy additional malware and enable system compromise. This is a common step after the discovery process to establish persistence and further compromise the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, APT28 is likely to use spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access and then perform discovery to understand the network environment. However, the use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process is not a typical characteristic of APT28's operations. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
