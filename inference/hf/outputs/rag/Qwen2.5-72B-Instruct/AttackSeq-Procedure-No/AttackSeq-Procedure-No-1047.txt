### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer, after communicating with a hardcoded URL using a man-on-the-side attack for command and control, is likely to maintain persistence through the registry's RUN key for configuration updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Persistence
     - **Technique:** T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
   - This TTP indicates that the malware (WinDealer) might use the registry's RUN key to maintain persistence, which means it will ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will indeed use the registry's RUN key to maintain persistence.
     - Given the related TTP (T1547.001), this is a plausible scenario. Malware often uses the registry's RUN key to ensure it starts automatically with the system, which aligns with the persistence tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will not use the registry's RUN key to maintain persistence.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP, as the technique T1547.001 specifically mentions the use of the registry's RUN key for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practice of malware using the registry's RUN key for persistence, the most plausible answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
