### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon rather than the executable's icon after executing malicious code using the AtomBombing technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting:** This technique involves creating fake security alerts to deceive users or security systems.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear benign.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using resource forks to store additional data, such as icons, in macOS files to make them appear benign.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **AtomBombing (T1055.012):** This is a code injection technique that exploits atom tables to execute arbitrary code. It is primarily used to evade detection and run malicious code in the context of a legitimate process.
   - **Resource Forking (T1564.009):** This technique is specific to macOS and involves using resource forks to store additional data, such as icons, to make files appear benign. This can be used to masquerade malicious files as benign ones.
   - **Masquerading (T1036):** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear benign, which can be achieved through various methods, including resource forking.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After executing malicious code using the AtomBombing technique, threat actors often aim to maintain stealth and avoid detection. One way to do this is by making the malicious file appear benign.
   - Resource forking (T1564.009) is a specific method used on macOS to store additional data, such as icons, to make files appear benign. This aligns with the goal of masquerading (T1036).
   - Therefore, it is plausible that threat actors would use resource forking to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon rather than the executable's icon to avoid arousing suspicion.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
