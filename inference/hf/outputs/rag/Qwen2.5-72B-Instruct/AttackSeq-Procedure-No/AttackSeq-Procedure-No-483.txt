### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of SparrowDoor using `cmd.exe` and communication with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:**
     - This technique involves using the Windows command shell (`cmd.exe`) to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that SparrowDoor was used for execution and communication with a C&C server. However, it does not explicitly state how the initial access was gained.
     - The related TTP T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) suggests that exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications is a common method for gaining initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute SparrowDoor aligns with the T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell) technique, which is used for execution.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The communication with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel is a common method for maintaining control over a compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTP T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), it is plausible that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (execution and C&C communication) is consistent with the typical behavior of malware that gains initial access through such vulnerabilities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
