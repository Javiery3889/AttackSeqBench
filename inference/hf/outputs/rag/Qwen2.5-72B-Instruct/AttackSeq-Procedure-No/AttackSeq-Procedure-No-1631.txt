### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will use custom-built malware to exfiltrate processed files to cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) **only** before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
     - This technique describes the process of exfiltrating data to cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the adversary will only exfiltrate the processed files to cloud storage services before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.
     - This sequence seems unlikely because the collection phase typically involves gathering data from various sources before exfiltration. Exfiltration to cloud storage would typically occur after the data has been collected and processed.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that the adversary will not limit exfiltration to cloud storage services only before collecting data from an information repository.
     - This sequence is more plausible because the collection phase involves gathering data from multiple sources, and exfiltration would typically occur after the data has been collected and processed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversary will not limit exfiltration to cloud storage services only before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

**Final Answer: B: No**
