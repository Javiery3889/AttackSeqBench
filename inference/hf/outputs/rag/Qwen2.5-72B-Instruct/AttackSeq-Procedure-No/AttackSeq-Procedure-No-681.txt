### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access was gained through misconfigured Docker API ports.
     - The question is about the sequence of events: reconnaissance using DOCKERGEDDON and deploying malicious containers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves gaining access to a system through externally exposed services, such as misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container:**
     - This technique involves deploying malicious containers to execute code or perform other malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007-Container API:**
     - This technique involves accessing credentials or sensitive information through the Docker API.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services):**
     - The attackers gain initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Tools like DOCKERGEDDON are used to scan and detect misconfigured Docker APIs. This is typically done during the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets.
   - **Deploying Malicious Containers (T1610-Deploy Container):**
     - After gaining access and identifying the misconfigured Docker API, the attackers would deploy malicious containers to execute their payload.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The logical sequence would be:
       1. **Reconnaissance:** Use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to detect misconfigured Docker APIs.
       2. **Initial Access:** Exploit the misconfigured Docker API to gain access.
       3. **Execution:** Deploy malicious containers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.
   - Based on the logical sequence of events, it is not likely that adversaries would detect the compromised Docker APIs only after deploying malicious containers. The detection and reconnaissance would typically occur before the deployment of malicious containers.

**Final Answer: B: No**
