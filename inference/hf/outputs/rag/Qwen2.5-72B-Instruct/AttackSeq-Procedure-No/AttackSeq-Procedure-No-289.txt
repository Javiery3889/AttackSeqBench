### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Elfin group after deploying DarkComet and a credential dumping tool.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool to extract credentials.
     - Bypassing logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands.
     - Proceeding with command and control (C2) communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001 - Keylogging:**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001 - Credentials In Files:**
     - This technique involves accessing credentials stored in files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool:**
     - DarkComet is a remote access trojan (RAT) that can be used to steal credentials.
     - The credential dumping tool aligns with the T1056.001 (Keylogging) and T1552.001 (Credentials In Files) techniques.
   - **Bypassing logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands:**
     - Bypassing logging is a common technique to avoid detection. This is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible step in an attack sequence to maintain stealth.
   - **Proceeding with command and control (C2) communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT:**
     - POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are tools used for C2 communications, which is a common next step after gaining initial access and stealing credentials.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After deploying DarkComet and a credential dumping tool, it is reasonable for the attackers to bypass logging to avoid detection and then proceed with C2 communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
