### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Earth Lusca is more likely to use GitHub for data exfiltration after collecting and compressing data using WinRAR, compared to using cloud accounts with megacmd.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:**
     - This technique involves compressing data into archives using utilities like WinRAR. This is consistent with the question's mention of using WinRAR to compress files.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:**
     - This technique involves transferring data to cloud storage accounts. The question mentions using megacmd, which is a command-line tool for interacting with cloud storage services like MEGA.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **GitHub for Data Exfiltration:**
     - GitHub is primarily a version control repository and is not typically used for data exfiltration. While it is possible to upload files to GitHub, it is not a common or efficient method for exfiltrating large amounts of data, especially sensitive or stolen data.
   - **Cloud Accounts with megacmd:**
     - Cloud storage services like MEGA are designed for storing and transferring large amounts of data. Using megacmd, a command-line tool, is a common and efficient method for exfiltrating data to cloud storage accounts. This aligns well with the T1567.002 technique mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in data exfiltration, it is more likely that Earth Lusca would use cloud accounts with megacmd rather than GitHub for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
