### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a backdoor configuration that includes an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.
   - It asks whether API hooking techniques are likely to be used to evade detection by modifying the functions `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1106-Native API (Execution Tactic):** This technique involves directly invoking system calls or native APIs to perform actions that are typically done by higher-level functions. This can be used to execute code or perform actions without using standard system utilities.
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking (Defense Evasion Tactic):** This technique involves blocking or modifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) to prevent detection. This can include modifying or deleting logs, altering network traffic, or hooking API functions to hide malicious activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **API Hooking:** API hooking is a common technique used in defense evasion to intercept and modify the behavior of API functions. By hooking `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable`, an attacker can manipulate the results of these functions to hide the presence of malicious processes or network connections.
   - **Relevance to the Question:**
     - The backdoor configuration already includes encryption and XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses, which are typical techniques for evading detection.
     - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is likely to use native API calls and indicator blocking to further evade detection.
     - Hooking `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` aligns with the goal of indicator blocking, as it can prevent security tools from detecting the backdoor's processes and network activity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the backdoor configuration and the related TTPs, it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying the functions `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` in memory.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
