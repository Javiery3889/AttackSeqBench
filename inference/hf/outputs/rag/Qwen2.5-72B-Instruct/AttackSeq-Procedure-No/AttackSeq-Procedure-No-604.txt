### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
     - Gaining execution through a Delphi downloader.
     - Using Windows API to execute commands.
     - Sending gathered system information to a C&C server.
   - The question then asks if the AutoIt downloader will perform system service discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1007 - System Service Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering system services to understand the environment and potentially identify services that can be exploited or manipulated.
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the Delphi downloader has already gathered system information and sent it to the C&C server. This aligns with the T1082 - System Information Discovery technique.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to gather more detailed information about the system, such as the services running on it. This aligns with the T1007 - System Service Discovery technique.
   - The AutoIt downloader, being part of the same attack chain, is likely to continue the discovery process to gather more information about the victim's machine.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Delphi downloader has already performed system information discovery (T1082).
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence is to perform system service discovery (T1007) to gain a deeper understanding of the victim's environment.
   - The AutoIt downloader, as part of the Sednit group's toolkit, is likely to follow this sequence to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the victim's system.
