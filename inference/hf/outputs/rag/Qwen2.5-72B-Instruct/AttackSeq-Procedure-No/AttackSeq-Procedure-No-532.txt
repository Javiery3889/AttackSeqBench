### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which can include cookies, passwords, and other authentication tokens.
   - **T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:** This technique specifically focuses on stealing web session cookies, which are used to maintain user sessions on websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs T1555.003 and T1539 both indicate that the attacker is likely to steal browser credentials and session cookies. Given that the Dropping Elephant backdoor has already evaded defenses and downloaded additional malware, it is plausible that it would also engage in credential theft, including stealing browser cookies.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor would not steal browser cookies. However, the related TTPs strongly indicate that stealing browser credentials and session cookies is a common tactic in such attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of backdoors like Dropping Elephant, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes stealing browser cookies.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
