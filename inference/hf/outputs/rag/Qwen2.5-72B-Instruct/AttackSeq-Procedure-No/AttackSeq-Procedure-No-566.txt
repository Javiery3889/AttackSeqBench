### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party software supply chain to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This sub-technique specifically refers to the compromise of a software supply chain to deliver malicious software updates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that attackers used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before compromising the software supply chain.
     - While it is possible that attackers might use legitimate credentials to gain access to a system or network, the primary focus of T1195 and T1195.002 is on the compromise of the software supply chain itself.
     - Using legitimate credentials to log into external remote services is more aligned with other techniques such as T1078 (Valid Accounts) or T1133 (External Remote Services), which are not mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that attackers did not use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before compromising the software supply chain.
     - The related TTPs focus on the supply chain compromise, which typically involves gaining access to the software development or distribution process, rather than logging into external remote services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the focus on the supply chain compromise, it is more plausible that the attackers did not use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before compromising the software supply chain.

**Final Answer: B: No**
