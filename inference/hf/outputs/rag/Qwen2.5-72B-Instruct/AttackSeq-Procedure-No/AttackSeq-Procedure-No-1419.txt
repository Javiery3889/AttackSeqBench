### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the threat actors will use the FriarFox malicious browser extension to contact a command and control (C2) server only before executing phishing emails impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' to deliver the extension for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions:**
     - This technique involves using browser extensions to maintain persistence. The FriarFox malicious browser extension fits this description.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with links to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the threat actors use the FriarFox extension to contact the C2 server only before sending the spearphishing emails.
     - However, the sequence described in the question is not typical. Normally, the malicious browser extension would be delivered via the spearphishing email to gain initial access, and then it would contact the C2 server to maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the threat actors do not use the FriarFox extension to contact the C2 server only before sending the spearphishing emails.
     - This aligns better with the typical sequence of events. The spearphishing email would be used to deliver the FriarFox extension, which would then contact the C2 server to maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, the most plausible answer is that the threat actors do not use the FriarFox extension to contact the C2 server only before sending the spearphishing emails.

**Final Answer: B: No**
