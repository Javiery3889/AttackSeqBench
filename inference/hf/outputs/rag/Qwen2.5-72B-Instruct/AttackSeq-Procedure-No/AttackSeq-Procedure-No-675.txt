### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use command and script interpreters to execute scripts or binaries only after exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports and tricking developers into pulling and running malicious container images, following the use of LD_PRELOAD for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**: This technique involves using LD_PRELOAD to hijack the execution flow for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1612-Build Image on Host**: This technique involves building a malicious image on the host, which can be used to trick developers into pulling and running it.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**: This technique is the same as the first one, emphasizing the use of LD_PRELOAD for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **LD_PRELOAD for Persistence**: Using LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow is a common technique for achieving persistence and privilege escalation. This is well-documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Exploiting Misconfigured Docker API Ports**: Misconfigured Docker API ports can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the Docker daemon, which can then be used to build and run malicious container images.
   - **Tricking Developers**: Once the attacker has access to the Docker environment, they can trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images. This is a plausible step in the attack chain.
   - **Command and Script Interpreters**: After gaining access and running the malicious container, it is common for attackers to use command and script interpreters to execute additional scripts or binaries to further their objectives.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After using LD_PRELOAD for persistence, attackers can exploit misconfigured Docker API ports, trick developers into running malicious container images, and then use command and script interpreters to execute additional scripts or binaries.
