### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will connect to a C&C server and use Dropbox API for command and control operations **only** before collecting and uploading information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves the use of web services (like Dropbox) for bidirectional communication between the malware and the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves the use of web services for command and control operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that the malware will connect to a C&C server and use Dropbox API for command and control operations only before collecting and uploading information.
     - However, the related TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to use Dropbox for both command and control and exfiltration. The sequence described in the question implies a strict order where the malware only uses Dropbox for command and control before collecting and uploading data, which is not typical.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the malware will not follow the strict sequence described in the question.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malware will use Dropbox for both command and control and exfiltration in a more integrated manner, rather than in a strict sequence where it only uses Dropbox for command and control before collecting and uploading data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, it is more plausible that the malware will use Dropbox for both command and control and exfiltration in a more integrated manner, rather than following the strict sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: No**
