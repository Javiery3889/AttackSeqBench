### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Darkhotel APT is likely to use 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer to execute malicious code only after seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware downloaded thousands of times for initial access.
   - The sequence of events described is:
     1. Initial access through seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware.
     2. Using 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
     3. Executing malicious code.
     4. Maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves using vulnerabilities in client applications (like Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors, often through vulnerabilities in client applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - This technique aligns with the idea of seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware. Drive-by compromises often involve malicious content being downloaded and executed when a user visits a compromised site.
   - **Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution):**
     - This technique aligns with the use of 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer. These exploits are used to execute malicious code on the victim's system.
   - **Maintaining Persistence:**
     - The question mentions maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings. This is a common technique used by APT groups to ensure that their malware runs every time the system starts.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     1. **Initial Access:** Seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
     2. **Execution:** Using 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
     3. **Persistence:** Adding autorun registry settings to maintain persistence.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the sequence, the answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
