### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary would identify privileged users during the discovery phase using the PsLogList tool after collecting email messages from both local and remote systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1124 - System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering the system time, which is not directly related to identifying privileged users.
   - **T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering the system owner and user information, which is more relevant to identifying privileged users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PsLogList Tool:** PsLogList is a tool from the Sysinternals suite that is used to list and analyze event logs. It can provide detailed information about system events, including user activities and system operations.
   - **Email Collection:** Collecting email messages from local and remote systems is a data collection activity that can provide valuable information about users and their activities.
   - **Discovery Phase:** During the discovery phase, adversaries often use various tools and techniques to gather information about the system and its users. Identifying privileged users is a common goal in this phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Email Collection and User Discovery:** Collecting email messages can provide insights into user roles and activities, which can help in identifying privileged users.
   - **PsLogList and User Discovery:** While PsLogList is primarily used for event log analysis, it can also provide information about user activities and system events. However, it is not specifically designed for user discovery.
   - **T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique is directly related to identifying system owners and users, which aligns with the goal of identifying privileged users.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the PsLogList tool can provide information about user activities and system events, and considering the related TTP T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery), it is plausible that an adversary could use PsLogList to identify privileged users during the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
