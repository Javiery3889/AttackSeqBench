### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS gained initial access using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - It asks whether it is likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including executing Shellcode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers used `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts. This is a common technique for gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the target system.
   - **Execution in Memory:**
     - Shellcode is often executed in memory to avoid detection by traditional file-based security solutions. This is a common practice in advanced attacks to evade defenses.
   - **Multi-Beacon Communication:**
     - Multi-beacon communication is a technique used for defense evasion. It involves using multiple communication channels or beacons to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This is typically employed after initial access to ensure the attackers can maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the Shellcode is executed in memory only after multi-beacon communication is established. However, in a typical attack, the Shellcode is often executed immediately after gaining initial access to establish a foothold and then multi-beacon communication is set up to maintain persistence and evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of events in an attack, it is more likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory immediately after gaining initial access, and multi-beacon communication was set up subsequently for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: B: No**
