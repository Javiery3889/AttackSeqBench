### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a DDoS attack would occur during the Impact phase instead of deploying RYUK ransomware a week later, after exfiltrating data using the SmartFTP Client during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data on the victim's systems to prevent access, which is a common tactic used by ransomware like RYUK.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1498-Network Denial of Service:** This technique involves disrupting network availability by overwhelming it with traffic.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service:** This technique involves disrupting the availability of specific endpoints by overwhelming them with traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RYUK Ransomware (T1486):** RYUK is a well-known ransomware that encrypts data on the victim's systems to extort payment. It is typically deployed after data exfiltration to maximize the impact and leverage the stolen data for ransom negotiations.
   - **DDoS Attack (T1498 and T1499):** DDoS attacks are used to disrupt network or endpoint availability. They are often used to distract or overwhelm the victim's defenses, but they do not directly encrypt data or provide a means for financial gain through ransom.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Timing and Motivation:**
     - After exfiltrating data, the attacker has already gained valuable information that can be used for ransom or other malicious purposes.
     - Deploying RYUK ransomware a week later aligns with the typical attack pattern where the attacker uses the exfiltrated data to increase the pressure on the victim to pay the ransom.
     - A DDoS attack during the Impact phase would not provide the same financial leverage as encrypting the data with RYUK. It would primarily serve as a distraction or a secondary attack vector, which is less likely to be the primary focus after data exfiltration.
   - **Impact and Goals:**
     - The primary goal of deploying RYUK is to encrypt data and demand a ransom, which is a more direct and profitable approach.
     - A DDoS attack, while disruptive, does not directly lead to financial gain and is less aligned with the typical goals of a ransomware attack.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
