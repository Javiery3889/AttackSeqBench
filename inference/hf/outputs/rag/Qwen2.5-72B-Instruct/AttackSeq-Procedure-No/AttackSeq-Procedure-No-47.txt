### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group will conduct file and directory discovery only after using the Responder tool to harvest credentials during credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique involves using tools like Responder to poison the LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) protocols to capture and relay authentication requests, which can be used to harvest credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries searching for specific files and directories on a system to gather information that can be useful for further actions, such as exfiltration or lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Lazarus group will only conduct file and directory discovery after using the Responder tool to harvest credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Lazarus group will not necessarily conduct file and directory discovery only after using the Responder tool to harvest credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question implies a specific order: lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers, followed by credential access using the Responder tool, and then file and directory discovery.
   - However, in real-world scenarios, adversaries often perform discovery activities at various stages of an attack, not necessarily in a strict linear sequence.
   - The use of the Responder tool to harvest credentials (T1557.001) is a common technique for credential access, but discovery activities (T1083) can occur at different points in the attack lifecycle, including before or after credential access.
   - Therefore, it is not accurate to say that file and directory discovery will only occur after credential access using the Responder tool.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
