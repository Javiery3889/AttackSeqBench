### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group, specifically the deployment of Hermes ransomware to encrypt files and leave ransom notes.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the group established command and control (C2) communication using backdoor malware to poll remote C2 servers for tasks and execute commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access by the victim, which aligns with the deployment of Hermes ransomware to encrypt files.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for C2 communication, which is a method to secure communication between the malware and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486):**
     - This technique is clearly relevant to the initial part of the question where the Lazarus group deploys Hermes ransomware to encrypt files.
   - **Symmetric Cryptography for C2 (T1573.001):**
     - This technique is relevant to the second part of the question, which asks about establishing C2 communication. However, the question specifically mentions backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) and polling remote C2 servers, which is a common method for maintaining C2 communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Lazarus group first encrypts files and then establishes C2 communication. The use of backdoor malware to poll remote C2 servers is a plausible and common method for maintaining C2 communication after the initial impact (encryption of files).
   - The related TTPs support the idea that the group would likely establish C2 communication to maintain control and receive further commands.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
