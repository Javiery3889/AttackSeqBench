### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Deep Panda.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion, which employs Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM).
   - The question then asks if Deep Panda is likely to gain persistence through the Milestone backdoor by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification:** This technique involves modifying code signing policies to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to evade detection or achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion with Fire Chili Rootkit:**
     - The Fire Chili rootkit uses DKOM to protect malicious artifacts, which aligns with the defense evasion tactic.
   - **Persistence with Milestone Backdoor:**
     - The Milestone backdoor is known to be used by Deep Panda for persistence.
     - Copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry aligns with the T1543.003-Windows Service technique for persistence.
   - **Registry Modification:**
     - Creating a service directly in the registry also aligns with the T1112-Modify Registry technique for defense evasion and persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs, it is plausible that Deep Panda would use the Milestone backdoor to gain persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
