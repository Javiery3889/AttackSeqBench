### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a suspicious email containing a Word document with a macro dropper.
   - The macro dropper is designed to execute a JavaScript payload.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attacker used CMSTP.exe to bypass AppLocker and launch a malicious script before the final JavaScript downloader dropped a file from a specified URL and executed it in the system's temporary directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker using a malicious file, such as a Word document with a macro, to execute code on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.003-CMSTP:** This technique involves using the CMSTP.exe utility to bypass AppLocker and execute a malicious script.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code on a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Infection Vector (T1204.002-Malicious File):** The sequence starts with a Word document with a macro dropper, which aligns with the T1204.002 technique.
   - **Bypassing AppLocker (T1218.003-CMSTP):** After the initial infection, the question suggests that the attacker used CMSTP.exe to bypass AppLocker. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as CMSTP.exe is known to be used for this purpose.
   - **Executing JavaScript (T1059.007-JavaScript):** The final step involves the JavaScript payload being executed, which aligns with the T1059.007 technique.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs.
   - The use of CMSTP.exe to bypass AppLocker and launch a malicious script is a known technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The final step of dropping and executing a file from a specified URL in the system's temporary directory is a common follow-up action after the initial infection and AppLocker bypass.
