### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Emissary Panda group:
     - They used the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.
     - They performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit.
     - They exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HyperBro Backdoor and C2 Communication:**
     - The HyperBro backdoor is known for its ability to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS, which is a common tactic for maintaining command and control.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit for lateral movement.
     - **EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144):**
       - This exploit targets a vulnerability in the SMB protocol, which aligns with the T1021.002 technique (SMB/Windows Admin Shares).
     - **Stolen Credentials:**
       - Using stolen credentials is a common method for lateral movement and is often combined with SMB exploitation.
   - **Exploiting Microsoft SharePoint:**
     - The question mentions exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.
     - This is a separate tactic and technique, typically falling under the Persistence and Defense Evasion categories, but it is not directly related to the lateral movement techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible, but the specific mention of exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence is not directly supported by the related TTPs provided.
   - However, the use of stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit for lateral movement is well-supported by the T1021.002 technique.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question is partially plausible, but the specific mention of exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence is not directly supported by the related TTPs provided. Therefore, the most accurate answer is "No."
