### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28, after using `advstoreshell.dll` for C&C communication, is likely to discover vulnerable systems through scanning IP ranges and report results to a centralized server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems that can be targeted for further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations to find potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will indeed discover vulnerable systems through scanning IP ranges and report results to a centralized server.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** and **T1046-Network Service Discovery** are both discovery techniques that align with the idea of scanning IP ranges to find vulnerable systems.
       - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** indicates that APT28 uses multiple communication channels, which could include reporting discovered vulnerabilities to a centralized server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will not discover vulnerable systems through scanning IP ranges and report results to a centralized server.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the provided TTPs, which clearly indicate that APT28 engages in discovery activities and uses multiple communication channels.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that APT28 will discover vulnerable systems through scanning IP ranges and report results to a centralized server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
