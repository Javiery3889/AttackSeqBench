### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke, after targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, is likely to capture credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing credentials by manipulating web portals, such as login pages.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique is also listed under the Collection tactic, indicating that it is used to collect credentials as part of the data collection process.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to collect credentials and other sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to capture credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page.
     - The related TTPs T1056.003 (Web Portal Capture) are directly relevant to this scenario. Both the Credential Access and Collection tactics include this technique, indicating that it is a common method for capturing credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to capture credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate that web portal capture is a technique used for both credential access and collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that CosmicDuke would capture credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
