### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - This exploit drops an embedded downloader file.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo` before establishing command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions that can help the malware execute its payload or evade detection.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` utility to execute code, which can be used to load and execute malicious DLLs.
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like an RTF document) to execute code on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, which is consistent with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - **Execution of Downloader:**
     - The exploit drops an embedded downloader file, which is a common next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Use of Native APIs:**
     - The question mentions the use of native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo`. This aligns with the T1106-Native API technique, which involves using native APIs to perform various actions.
   - **Establishing Command and Control:**
     - After gathering system information and potentially performing other actions, the malware would likely establish C2 using a custom TCP protocol. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical flow of the attack, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo` before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
