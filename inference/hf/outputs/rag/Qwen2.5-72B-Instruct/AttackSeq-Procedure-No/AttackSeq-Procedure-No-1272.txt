### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the WastedLocker ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase after using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the Defense Evasion phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:**
     - This technique involves actions that prevent or impede the recovery of a system, such as deleting system volume shadow copies. This is a common tactic used by ransomware to ensure that victims cannot restore their data from backups.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the ransomware will indeed delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.
     - Given the related TTP (T1490-Inhibit System Recovery), it is highly plausible that WastedLocker would delete system volume shadow copies to prevent recovery. This aligns with the typical behavior of ransomware to ensure that victims cannot restore their data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the ransomware will not delete system volume shadow copies.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP and the common behavior of ransomware to inhibit system recovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTP and the typical behavior of ransomware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that WastedLocker will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
