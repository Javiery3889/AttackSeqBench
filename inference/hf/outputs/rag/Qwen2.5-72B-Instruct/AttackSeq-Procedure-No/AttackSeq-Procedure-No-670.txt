### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries who use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan for compromised Docker APIs would develop malicious npm packages during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves the development of malware, which can include creating malicious software such as npm packages.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing various capabilities, which can include creating and deploying malicious software.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves using social media accounts to develop resources, which is not directly related to the development of malicious npm packages but can be part of a broader resource development strategy.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages during the Resource Development phase.
     - The related TTPs T1587.001-Malware and T1587-Develop Capabilities support this choice, as they both involve the development of malicious software and capabilities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages during the Resource Development phase.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as the development of malware and capabilities is a common part of the Resource Development phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression from reconnaissance to resource development, it is more plausible that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
