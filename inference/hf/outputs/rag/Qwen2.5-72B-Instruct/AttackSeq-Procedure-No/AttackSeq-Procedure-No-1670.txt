### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TDrop2 malware will use Google Drive for C2 (Command and Control) before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
   - The key points are:
     - Discovery activities have been performed.
     - Google Drive is used for C2.
     - Communication with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding schemes (like base64) to obfuscate command and control traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard or custom encoding schemes to obfuscate command and control traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that TDrop2 malware will use Google Drive for C2 before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
     - **Google Drive for C2:**
       - Google Drive can be used as a C2 channel, which aligns with the T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication technique.
     - **Encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet:**
       - This aligns with the T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding technique, as it involves using a custom base64 alphabet.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TDrop2 malware will not use Google Drive for C2 before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the use of Google Drive and custom base64 encoding.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that TDrop2 malware will use Google Drive for C2 before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
