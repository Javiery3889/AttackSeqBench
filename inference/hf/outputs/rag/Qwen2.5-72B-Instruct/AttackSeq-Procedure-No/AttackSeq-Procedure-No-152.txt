### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021:
     - They used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
     - They gathered output files during the Discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials or other authentication material to move laterally.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the network, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance and gathering output files aligns with the Discovery phase, specifically T1083 (File and Directory Discovery).
   - **Lateral Movement Phase:**
     - The question asks about the likelihood of abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.
     - **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** is a relevant technique for lateral movement, which includes the use of stolen credentials or tokens.
     - SAML tokens are a form of authentication material that can be used to gain access to resources, making them a potential target for lateral movement.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that TG1021 has already performed reconnaissance and gathered information, it is plausible that they would use the information to facilitate lateral movement.
   - Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token is a sophisticated method of lateral movement that aligns with the use of alternate authentication material (T1550).
