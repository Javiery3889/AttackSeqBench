### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - It asks whether the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Adobe Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding a payload within another file (in this case, a GIF image) to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The spear-phishing attack uses a malicious Flash file (‘show.swf’) to exploit CVE-2015-5119. This aligns with T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
   - **Execution of Shellcode:**
     - Once the exploit is successful, the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will execute shellcode. This aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The shellcode is likely to perform Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection. One such technique is T1027.009-Embedded Payloads, where the payload is embedded in a GIF image.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The shellcode is executed first to gain initial access and establish a foothold.
     - After gaining access, the shellcode will then install the payload embedded in the GIF image to further evade detection and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks if the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the shellcode is likely to execute first to gain initial access, and then it will install the embedded payload for Defense Evasion.
   - Therefore, the answer is **No**.

**Final Answer: B: No**
