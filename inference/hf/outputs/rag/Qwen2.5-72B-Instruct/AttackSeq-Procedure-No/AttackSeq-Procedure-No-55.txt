### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus group achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending emails to potential victims to gain initial access to the victim's network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves sending emails with malicious attachments, such as a Word document, to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):** The Lazarus group is known to use spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a victim's network. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Execution of ThreatNeedle Backdoor:** Once the initial access is gained, the next step is to execute the malware. The ThreatNeedle backdoor is known to be loaded into memory, which is a common technique to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Discovery Activities:** After gaining initial access and executing the backdoor, the next logical step is to conduct discovery activities, such as system network connections discovery, to understand the victim's network and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, it is highly likely that Lazarus achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
