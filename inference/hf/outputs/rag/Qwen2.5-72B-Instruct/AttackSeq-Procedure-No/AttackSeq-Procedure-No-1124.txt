### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - It then asks whether the Flash file ‘show.swf’ is likely to downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Adobe Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1562.010-Downgrade Attack:** This technique involves downgrading a protocol to a less secure version to capture credentials or other sensitive information.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment (in this case, the Flash file ‘show.swf’).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing the malicious Flash file ‘show.swf’.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The Flash file exploits the vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Downgrade Attack (T1562.010):** This technique is used to downgrade a protocol to capture credentials. However, it is typically used after gaining initial access and executing code to set up a more persistent or stealthy method of credential harvesting.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves a Flash file that exploits a vulnerability to gain initial access. Once the exploit is successful, the shellcode is executed to install the payload.
   - The downgrade attack (T1562.010) is a technique used to capture NTLM hashes, but it is not typically part of the initial exploitation phase. It is more likely to be used after the initial access has been gained and the attacker has established a foothold in the network.
   - The question asks if the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload. Given the typical sequence of events in such attacks, it is unlikely that the downgrade attack would occur before the payload is installed.

### Final Answer: B: No
