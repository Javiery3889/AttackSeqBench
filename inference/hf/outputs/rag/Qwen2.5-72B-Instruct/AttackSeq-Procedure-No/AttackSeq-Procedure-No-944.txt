### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through watering hole tactics exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers execute custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use parent PID spoofing to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing:** This technique involves manipulating the parent process ID (PPID) to make a process appear as a child of a trusted process, which can help in gaining higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782, which are vulnerabilities in public-facing applications (T1190).
   - **Execution of Custom Shellcode:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers execute custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader. This step is typical in post-exploitation activities to establish a foothold and potentially download additional tools.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question asks about the likelihood of using parent PID spoofing (T1134.004) for privilege escalation.
     - Parent PID spoofing is a technique used to make a process appear as a child of a trusted process, which can help in gaining higher privileges.
     - Given that the attackers have already gained initial access and are executing custom shellcode, it is plausible that they would use additional techniques to escalate privileges.
     - T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) is another technique that can be used to gain higher privileges, but it is not specific to parent PID spoofing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the attack sequence described, it is likely that the attackers would use parent PID spoofing to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
