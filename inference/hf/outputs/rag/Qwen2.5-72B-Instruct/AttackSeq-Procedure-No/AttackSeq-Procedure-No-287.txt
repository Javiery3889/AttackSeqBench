### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Elfin, after deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill, would exploit CVE-2018-20250 by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails only after scanning for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client) to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, deliver the exploit or malware to the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Step 1: Deploying Malware Tools (Notestuk and Stonedrill):**
       - This is part of the execution phase, where the malware is deployed on the target system.
     - **Step 2: Scanning for Vulnerable Websites:**
       - This is typically part of the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker identifies potential targets or creates C&C infrastructure.
     - **Step 3: Exploiting CVE-2018-20250:**
       - This is part of the exploitation phase, where the attacker uses a known vulnerability to gain access to the target system.
     - **Step 4: Delivering the Exploit via Spear-Phishing Emails:**
       - This is part of the initial access phase, where the attacker uses social engineering to deliver the exploit to the target.

   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The question suggests a sequence where the attacker first deploys malware, then scans for vulnerable websites, and finally delivers the exploit via spear-phishing emails.
     - However, the typical sequence in a cyber attack is:
       1. **Reconnaissance:** Scanning for vulnerable websites.
       2. **Initial Access:** Delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails.
       3. **Execution:** Deploying malware tools.
       4. **Exploitation:** Using the vulnerability to gain further access.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question (deploying malware, scanning, then delivering the exploit) is not the most logical or common sequence. Typically, the scanning and initial access (spear-phishing) would occur before the deployment of malware and exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. The correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
