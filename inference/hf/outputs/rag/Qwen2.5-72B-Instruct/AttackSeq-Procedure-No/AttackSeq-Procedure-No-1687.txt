### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores only after persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using existing, legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves collecting credentials from password stores, such as web browsers, email clients, and other applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1078-Valid Accounts):** This technique is often used to ensure that the attackers can maintain access to the system over time. Configuring applications to run batch files every hour is a method of persistence, which aligns with the T1078 technique.
   - **Credential Access (T1555-Credentials from Password Stores):** This technique is used to gather additional credentials that can be used to further compromise the system or move laterally within the network. Collecting credentials from password stores is a common step after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers first upload credentials to an external FTP server, then persist by configuring applications to run batch files every hour, and finally use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.
   - This sequence is plausible because:
     - **Initial Access and Exfiltration:** Uploading credentials to an external FTP server indicates that the attackers have already gained access to the system and have exfiltrated some initial credentials.
     - **Persistence:** Configuring applications to run batch files every hour ensures that the attackers can maintain their presence on the system.
     - **Credential Access:** Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores is a logical next step to gather more credentials for further exploitation.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores only after persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
