### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NanHaiShu, after using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information, is likely to communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers only before gathering system information from the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the malware is interested in gathering system information from the infected machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that NanHaiShu communicates with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers only before gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that NanHaiShu does not communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers only before gathering system information.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a sequence of actions:
     1. **HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.**
     2. **Communication with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers.**
     3. **Gathering system information.**
   - The related TTP (T1082-System Information Discovery) confirms that the malware gathers system information, but it does not specify the order of communication with C&C servers or the use of dynamic DNS providers.
   - Typically, malware would gather system information first to understand the environment before communicating with C&C servers. This is because the gathered information can be used to tailor further actions or to report back to the C&C server.
   - The use of dynamic DNS providers is a method for maintaining communication with C&C servers, but it is not a prerequisite for gathering system information.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical sequence of actions in malware operations and the related TTP, it is more plausible that NanHaiShu would gather system information first before communicating with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers.

### Final Answer: B: No
