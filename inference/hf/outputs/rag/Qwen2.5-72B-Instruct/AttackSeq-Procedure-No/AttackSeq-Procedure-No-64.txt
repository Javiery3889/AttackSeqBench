### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Grandoreiro will enumerate domain users using AdFind after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1087.002-Domain Account (Discovery):** This technique involves enumerating domain users, which is a common step in the discovery phase to gather information about the network and potential targets.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery (Discovery):** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the computer's name and other system details.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery (Discovery):** This technique involves identifying the user or owner of the system, which can include the username.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Grandoreiro is known to perform reconnaissance and gather information about the system and network. The related TTPs indicate that it is common for attackers to collect system information (T1082), discover the system owner/user (T1033), and then enumerate domain users (T1087.002).
     - After collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software, it is logical for the attacker to proceed with enumerating domain users to gain a broader understanding of the network and potential targets.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro would not enumerate domain users after collecting the specified information. However, the related TTPs and the typical behavior of attackers in the discovery phase make this less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in the discovery phase, it is likely that Grandoreiro will enumerate domain users using AdFind after collecting the specified information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
