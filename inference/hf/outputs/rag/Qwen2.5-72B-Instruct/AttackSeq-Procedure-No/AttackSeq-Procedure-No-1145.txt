### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations after identifying outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.005-Scan Databases:** This technique involves scanning databases to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage:** This technique involves collecting data from cloud storage services.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network services to understand the network topology and identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **Reconnaissance (T1596.005-Scan Databases):** Shodan and Censys are tools commonly used for reconnaissance to discover publicly available resources and vulnerabilities. They can help identify outdated systems and devices, which aligns with the initial step of uncovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices.
     - **Discovery (T1046-Network Service Discovery):** Once the initial reconnaissance is done, using Shodan and Censys to discover network services and publicly available resources is a logical next step to gather more detailed information about the target.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys. However, given the related TTPs and the common use of these tools in the reconnaissance phase, this choice is less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of Shodan and Censys in the reconnaissance phase, it is likely that cybercriminals would use these tools to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations after identifying outdated systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
