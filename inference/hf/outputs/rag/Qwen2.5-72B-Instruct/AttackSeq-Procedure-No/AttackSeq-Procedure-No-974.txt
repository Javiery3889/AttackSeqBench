### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack's final payload will use secondary C2 servers for communication before connecting back to the primary C2 server at IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute code with the privileges of the legitimate process. This is used for defense evasion.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (Command and Control):** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain command and control. This can include using secondary C2 servers.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port (Command and Control):** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique is used to execute the initial payload and evade defenses. It does not directly relate to the C2 communication.
   - **Multi-Stage Channels (T1104):** This technique suggests that the attack might use multiple stages of communication, which could include secondary C2 servers. This aligns with the question's scenario.
   - **Non-Standard Port (T1571):** This technique suggests that the C2 communication might use a non-standard port, which is consistent with the given IP address and port 9999.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The use of multi-stage channels (T1104) indicates that it is plausible for the attack to use secondary C2 servers before connecting to the primary C2 server. This aligns with the question's scenario.
   - The non-standard port (T1571) further supports the use of a specific and possibly less detectable port for C2 communication.
