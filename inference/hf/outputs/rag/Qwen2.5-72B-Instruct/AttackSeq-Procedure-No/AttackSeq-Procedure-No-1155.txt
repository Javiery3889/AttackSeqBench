### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information or funds from victims.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials, which can include usernames and passwords.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves compromising email accounts to gain further access or to use them in subsequent attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers will collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments.
     - This sequence seems less plausible because:
       - Collecting credentials through phishing sites is a common early-stage tactic to gain initial access or to gather more information.
       - Demanding ransom payments is typically a later stage in the attack, often after the attackers have already gained significant control or access to the victim's systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers will not collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments.
     - This sequence is more plausible because:
       - Collecting credentials through phishing sites is a common early-stage tactic to gain initial access or to gather more information.
       - Demanding ransom payments is typically a later stage in the attack, often after the attackers have already gained significant control or access to the victim's systems.
       - The related TTPs (T1589.001-Credentials and T1586.002-Email Accounts) suggest that credential collection is a common early-stage activity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers will not collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments. Instead, they are more likely to collect credentials early in the attack and use them to gain further access or to demand ransom payments later.

**Final Answer: B: No**
