### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Derusbi, after using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection, will bind to a raw socket and initiate communication with the C2 server before gathering system information about the victim host.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves the use of protocols below the application layer (e.g., raw sockets) to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Step 1: Evasion (Using Turbo LKM):**
       - Derusbi uses the Turbo LKM to modify the system's global call table to evade detection. This is a common initial step to ensure the malware remains undetected.
     - **Step 2: Command and Control (Binding to Raw Socket):**
       - After evading detection, the next logical step is to establish a communication channel with the C2 server. Using a raw socket (T1095) is a method to achieve this.
     - **Step 3: Discovery (Gathering System Information):**
       - Once the communication channel is established, the malware can then gather system information (T1082) to understand the environment and plan further actions.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question (binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server before gathering system information) aligns with the typical behavior of malware. Establishing a C2 channel is often a priority to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Derusbi will bind to a raw socket and initiate communication with the C2 server before gathering system information about the victim host.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
