### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Tortoiseshell created the website `hiremilitaryheroes[.]com` specifically to conduct reconnaissance campaigns and host malware downloaders only after executing the reconnaissance tool `bird.exe` to perform discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves checking for internet connectivity to determine if the system is connected to the internet.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading files to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from `hiremilitaryheroes[.]com`. This suggests that the website was already in place to serve as a vector for delivering the malware.
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The related TTPs include `T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery`, which is a discovery technique used to check if the system is connected to the internet. This is typically done after gaining initial access to understand the environment.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the website was created first to deliver the malware, and then the reconnaissance tool `bird.exe` was used to perform discovery.
     - The related TTPs support the idea that discovery techniques are used after gaining initial access, not before creating the website.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is more likely that Tortoiseshell created the website `hiremilitaryheroes[.]com` to deliver the malware and then used the reconnaissance tool `bird.exe` to perform discovery after gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
