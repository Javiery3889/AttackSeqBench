### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file to gain initial access.
     2. Using a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system.
     3. Establishing communication with C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments (e.g., PDF files) to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System:**
     - This technique involves using hidden file systems to evade detection by security tools and analysts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - The question mentions that the initial access is gained through spearphishing emails with a PDF file. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1564.005-Hidden File System):**
     - The question also mentions the use of a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system. This aligns with the T1564.005 technique.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical:
       1. Gain initial access through spearphishing.
       2. Use a hidden file system to evade detection.
       3. Establish communication with C&C servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is plausible that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
