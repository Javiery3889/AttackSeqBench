### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after overwriting the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of the Defense Evasion tactic, the Shamoon malware is likely to execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access during execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit:**
     - This technique involves modifying the boot process to maintain persistence and evade detection. Overwriting the VBR is a common method used in bootkits to achieve this.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time or in response to certain events.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code, which can be used for both persistence and execution purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Overwriting the VBR (T1542.003-Bootkit):**
     - This is a common initial step in the Shamoon malware's attack sequence to ensure persistence and evade detection.
   - **Executing a Copy of Itself as a Scheduled Job (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):**
     - After gaining persistence through the VBR overwrite, it is plausible that the malware would use scheduled tasks to ensure it runs at regular intervals or in response to specific triggers.
   - **Dropping a Driver for Disk Access:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, dropping a driver for disk access is a common technique used by malware to gain low-level access to the system, which can be useful for further persistence and execution.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the known behavior of Shamoon malware. Overwriting the VBR is a typical initial step for persistence and evasion. Using scheduled tasks to execute a copy of itself is a common follow-up action to ensure the malware remains active. Dropping a driver for disk access is also a plausible step to maintain control over the system.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
