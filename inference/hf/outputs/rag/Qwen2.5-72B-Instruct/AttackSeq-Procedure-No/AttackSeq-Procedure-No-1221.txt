### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the T9000 malware is likely to capture data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft, only after evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid security products and ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion:**
     - This technique involves using mutual exclusion (mutex) mechanisms to ensure that only one instance of the malware runs on the victim's system. This can help the malware avoid detection by security products that might flag multiple instances as suspicious.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using a non-standard protocol for communication with the C2 server, which can help evade detection by network monitoring tools that are configured to detect standard protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to capture data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft, only after evading detection by customizing its installation and ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion:** Ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events is a common technique to avoid detection.
       - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** Using an encrypted binary protocol for C2 communication helps evade detection by network monitoring tools.
     - After evading detection, it is plausible that the malware would proceed to capture data, including Skype communications and file theft, as these are common objectives for malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to capture data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft, only after evading detection by customizing its installation and ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware is likely to take steps to evade detection before performing data capture.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the malware is likely to capture data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft, only after evading detection by customizing its installation and ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
