### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SunBird and Hornbird will exfiltrate data over C2 channels to their command and control servers only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.
   - The key points are:
     - Data is collected in SQLite databases.
     - Data is compressed into ZIP files.
     - Data is stored in hidden folders on external storage.
     - The exfiltration is over C2 channels.
     - The C2 infrastructure is used to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves compressing collected data to reduce the size and make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data to a command and control (C2) server over a C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the exfiltration will only occur after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.
     - This aligns with the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack where data is first collected, compressed, and stored, and then exfiltrated over a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the exfiltration will not wait for the C2 infrastructure to be utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.
     - This is less likely because the C2 infrastructure is typically a crucial part of the exfiltration process, and data is often exfiltrated to a C2 server for further processing or storage.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack, the most plausible answer is that the exfiltration will occur over C2 channels to the command and control servers after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
