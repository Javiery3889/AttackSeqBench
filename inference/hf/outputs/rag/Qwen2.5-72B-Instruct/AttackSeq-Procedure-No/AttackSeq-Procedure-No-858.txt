### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Explosive Trojan.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Credential Access** using keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
     - **Lateral Movement** by abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token.
     - **Command and Control** using a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens) to authenticate and move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The question mentions using keylogging to gain administrator passwords, which aligns with the initial step of obtaining credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question specifically mentions abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
     - The related TTPs include T1550 (Use Alternate Authentication Material), which fits well with using stolen SAML tokens.
     - T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) and T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) are also relevant but do not specifically mention SAML tokens.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question mentions using a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control, which is a plausible next step after gaining access and moving laterally.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1550 (Use Alternate Authentication Material) for lateral movement using SAML tokens.
   - The other techniques (T1210 and T1021.002) are also relevant but do not specifically address the use of SAML tokens.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
