### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - The exploit is used to execute a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx) via exploitation for client execution.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Bankshot implant will use a COM object to gather system information after being executed.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves using a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Adobe Flash, Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
     - The exploit is typically delivered through a malicious document (e.g., a Word document) that the user opens.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing the Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
     - This aligns with the T1203 technique, where the exploit is used to execute the malicious Word document (Agreement.docx).

   - **Execution of Bankshot Implant:**
     - Once the exploit is successful, the Bankshot implant is executed.
     - Bankshot is known to use various techniques to maintain persistence and gather information.

   - **Use of COM Object:**
     - COM (Component Object Model) objects are often used by malware to interact with the operating system and gather system information.
     - It is common for malware to use COM objects to query system information, such as installed software, user accounts, and network configurations.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the Bankshot implant is executed via the exploitation of a client application (T1203), it is highly likely that it will use COM objects to gather system information.
   - This is a common technique used by malware to understand the environment it is operating in and to perform further actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
