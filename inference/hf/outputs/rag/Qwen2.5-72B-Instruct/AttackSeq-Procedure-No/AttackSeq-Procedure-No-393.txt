### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the C2 MySQL database will contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase, given that a PHP script has already gathered system profile information and stored it in the MySQL database during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering the system time from the victim's machine.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering detailed information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that the C2 MySQL database will contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.
     - This is unlikely because the question states that the PHP script has already gathered system profile information and stored it in the MySQL database during the discovery phase. Therefore, the database would contain information gathered during the discovery phase, not just before it.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the C2 MySQL database will not contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.
     - This is more plausible because the PHP script has already gathered and stored system profile information during the discovery phase. The database would contain information gathered during the discovery phase, not just before it.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the C2 MySQL database will not contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
