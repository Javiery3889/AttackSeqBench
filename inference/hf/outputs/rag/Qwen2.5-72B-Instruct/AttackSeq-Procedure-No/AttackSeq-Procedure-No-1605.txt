### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices only after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Initial access through malicious LNK files.
     - Delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
     - Exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, such as LNK files, which can be used to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The T1204-User Execution technique aligns with gaining initial access through malicious LNK files.
   - **Delivery of Payloads:**
     - The question mentions a "convoluted infection chain," which suggests multiple steps in the infection process. The use of DLL side-loading (T1574.002) can be part of this chain, as it can be used to deliver and maintain the payload.
   - **Exfiltration of Kavach Authentication Databases:**
     - The question specifically asks about exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases. While the related TTPs do not directly mention exfiltration, they do provide context for the infection and persistence mechanisms.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs support the initial access and the delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain. However, the question specifically asks about the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
   - Given the context, it is plausible that SideCopy would exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases after gaining initial access and delivering payloads, but the provided TTPs do not explicitly confirm this.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The provided TTPs support the initial access and the delivery of payloads, but they do not explicitly confirm the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "No."
