### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Packrat is likely to use phishing campaigns during the reconnaissance phase only after using fake organizations in resource development to prepare for their operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves creating or using email accounts to support the adversary's operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.001-Social Media:** This technique involves using social media to gather information about the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (T1585.002-Email Accounts):** This is typically used to create or acquire resources that will be used in later stages of the attack, such as email accounts for phishing.
   - **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing):** Phishing is a common method for gaining initial access to a target's system.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1593.001-Social Media):** This is used to gather information about the target, which can be used to make phishing campaigns more effective.

   - The question implies a sequence where Packrat first uses fake organizations in resource development, then uses phishing during the reconnaissance phase. However, the MITRE ATT&CK framework typically shows that resource development (creating fake organizations and email accounts) is a preparatory step that happens before initial access and reconnaissance.

   - Phishing (T1566) is generally used for initial access, not reconnaissance. Reconnaissance techniques like T1593.001 (Social Media) are used to gather information that can be used to make phishing more effective, but they are not the same as using phishing itself.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is not likely that Packrat would use phishing during the reconnaissance phase only after using fake organizations in resource development. Phishing is more commonly used for initial access, not reconnaissance.

   **Final Answer: B: No**
