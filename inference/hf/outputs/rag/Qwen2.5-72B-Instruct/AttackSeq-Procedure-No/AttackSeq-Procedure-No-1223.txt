### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where T9000 exfiltrates data to a C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.
   - It then asks if it is likely that T9000 will target Skype users, automatically capture data from removable media, and steal sensitive files only after evading detection by customizing its installation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a target system to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.001-Binary Padding:** This technique involves adding unnecessary data to a binary to evade detection by security products.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** This aligns with the initial part of the question where T9000 exfiltrates data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):** This technique supports the idea of automatically capturing and exfiltrating data, which could include files from removable media.
   - **Binary Padding (T1027.001):** This technique is used to evade detection, which aligns with the part of the question about customizing the installation to avoid analysis by security researchers and security products.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves exfiltration, targeting specific users (Skype), capturing data from removable media, and evading detection.
   - The related TTPs support the exfiltration and evasion parts but do not explicitly mention targeting Skype users or capturing data from removable media.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the TTPs support the exfiltration and evasion parts, the specific targeting of Skype users and capturing data from removable media is not directly supported by the given TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the sequence described in the question is the most plausible based on the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer:
B: No
