### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Mustang Panda group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering a downloader with filenames linked to current events.
     - Opening a decoy document to gain initial access.
     - Deploying a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax.
     - Engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1542.001 - System Firmware (UEFI Rootkit):**
     - This technique involves modifying system firmware to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves altering the appearance of code or data to make it harder to analyze and understand.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that Mustang Panda delivers a downloader with filenames linked to current events and opens a decoy document to gain initial access. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **UEFI Rootkit (LoJax):**
     - Deploying a UEFI rootkit like LoJax is a sophisticated and advanced technique used for maintaining persistence and evading detection. It is typically used after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the system.
   - **Control-Flow Obfuscation:**
     - Control-flow obfuscation is a technique used to make the code harder to analyze and understand, which is a form of defense evasion. This is often used to protect the malware from being detected or reverse-engineered.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Gain initial access using a downloader and decoy document.
     2. Deploy a UEFI rootkit (LoJax).
     3. Engage in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.
   - This sequence is plausible because:
     - Initial access is necessary before deploying advanced persistence mechanisms like UEFI rootkits.
     - Once the UEFI rootkit is deployed, the attackers may use control-flow obfuscation to protect their malware and maintain stealth.
