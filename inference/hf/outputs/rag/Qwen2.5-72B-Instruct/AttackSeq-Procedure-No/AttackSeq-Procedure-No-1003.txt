### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Longhorn's malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol after communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C&C) communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data at scheduled times to avoid detection by limiting the amount of data transferred at once and using randomized intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions that the malware communicates externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals. This aligns with the T1029-Scheduled Transfer technique.
   - The question also asks about the configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique, which involves using web protocols for C&C communication.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination per target, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. The T1071.001-Web Protocols technique only mentions the use of web protocols, not the specific configuration of domain and IP address combinations.
   - The use of a custom cryptographic protocol is also not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, the question's specific details about configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target and using a custom cryptographic protocol are not directly supported by the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
