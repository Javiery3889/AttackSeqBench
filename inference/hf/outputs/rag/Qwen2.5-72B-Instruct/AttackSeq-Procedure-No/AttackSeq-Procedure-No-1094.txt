### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT34 is likely to modify the `DSUserAgentCap.pm` Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to retrieve a `sys_id` for tracking infected targets after using PICKPOCKET, VALUEVAULT, and LONGWATCH malware to extract credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling (Persistence):** This technique involves using network traffic to signal or communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
   - **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary (Persistence):** This technique involves modifying or replacing legitimate host software binaries to maintain persistence.
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging (Credential Access):** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PICKPOCKET, VALUEVAULT, and LONGWATCH Malware:**
     - These are known to be used by APT34 for credential extraction and persistence.
     - PICKPOCKET is a keylogger, which aligns with T1056.001-Keylogging.
     - VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH are used for persistence and data exfiltration, which can align with T1205-Traffic Signaling and T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary.

   - **Modifying the `DSUserAgentCap.pm` Perl Module:**
     - This action would involve compromising a host software binary, which aligns with T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary.
     - The purpose of modifying this module to retrieve a `sys_id` for tracking infected targets suggests a need for persistence and possibly traffic signaling to maintain control over the infected system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that APT34 has a history of using sophisticated techniques for persistence and credential access, modifying the `DSUserAgentCap.pm` Perl module to retrieve a `sys_id` for tracking infected targets is a plausible next step after extracting credentials.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence of actions, as they involve both persistence and credential access techniques.
