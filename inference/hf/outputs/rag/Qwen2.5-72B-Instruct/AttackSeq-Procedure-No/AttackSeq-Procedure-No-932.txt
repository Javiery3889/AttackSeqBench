### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will target chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access before using sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves targeting chat messages to obtain credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves using keyloggers to capture keystrokes, which can include credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications, which can include chat messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT will target chat messages for credential access before using sophisticated capabilities.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1552.008-Chat Messages** and **T1213.005-Messaging Applications** indicate that targeting chat messages is a known technique for credential access and data collection.
       - **T1056.001-Keylogging** is another method for credential access, which can be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to targeting chat messages.
     - It is plausible that after deploying malware components, the APT group would use these techniques to gather credentials and sensitive information before moving on to more sophisticated activities like signing backdoors and encrypting data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT will not target chat messages for credential access before using sophisticated capabilities.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as the techniques listed clearly indicate that targeting chat messages and using keyloggers are part of the credential access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack activities, the most plausible answer is that Darkhotel APT will target chat messages for credential access before using more sophisticated capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
