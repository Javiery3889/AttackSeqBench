### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a relay server, after hosting a rendezvous-type traffic relay program on the Comfoo C2 server, will listen on multiple TCP ports for executing proxy-related tasks only before collecting system and network information via Comfoo RAT capabilities such as keystroke logging, screenshots, and file management.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This sub-technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic within a network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This sub-technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the relay server will listen on multiple TCP ports for proxy-related tasks only before collecting system and network information.
     - The related TTPs indicate that the use of a proxy (T1090) and internal proxy (T1090.001) are part of the command and control phase, which is consistent with the relay server's role.
     - However, the question also mentions collecting system and network information via Comfoo RAT capabilities such as keystroke logging, screenshots, and file management. This collection of information is part of the Collection tactic (T1056.001), which typically follows the establishment of command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the relay server will not listen on multiple TCP ports for proxy-related tasks only before collecting system and network information.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the relay server will first establish the command and control infrastructure (using proxies) and then proceed to collect system and network information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the relay server will first establish the command and control infrastructure (using proxies) and then proceed to collect system and network information via Comfoo RAT capabilities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
