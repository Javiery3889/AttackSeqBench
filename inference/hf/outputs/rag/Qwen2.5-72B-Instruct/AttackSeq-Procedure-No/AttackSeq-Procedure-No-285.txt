### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after Elfin exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader, they established command and control (C2) using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different protocol than the one used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - If Elfin used a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for exfiltration, it suggests they might have used a separate channel for exfiltration. However, it does not preclude the possibility of using the same channel for C2.
   - **Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048):**
     - This technique implies that the exfiltration channel is different from the C2 channel. If Elfin used a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for exfiltration, it is plausible that they used a different tool for C2.
   - **POSHC2 and Quasar RAT:**
     - POSHC2 is a C2 framework, and Quasar RAT is a remote access trojan. Both are commonly used for establishing and maintaining C2 communications.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - Elfin exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.
     - It is reasonable to assume that after exfiltration, they would need to maintain C2 to continue their operations.
     - Using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for C2 aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors who often use multiple tools for different stages of an attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, it is likely that Elfin established command and control using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT after exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
