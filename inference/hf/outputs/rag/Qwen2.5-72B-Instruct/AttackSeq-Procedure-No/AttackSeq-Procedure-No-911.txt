### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Gamaredon group is likely to automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If Gamaredon were to automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives, it would imply a sequential process where the initial harvested documents are sent first, and then the scanning of other drives occurs.
     - However, the related TTPs suggest that the group is more likely to discover and collect data from various sources (removable media, network shared drives) as part of a broader data collection effort.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon does not automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is more plausible that Gamaredon would first discover and collect data from various sources (removable media, network shared drives) and then upload the collected data to the C&C server in a more comprehensive manner.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of operations, it is more likely that Gamaredon would not automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data. Instead, they would likely perform a more comprehensive data collection process.

**Final Answer: B: No**
