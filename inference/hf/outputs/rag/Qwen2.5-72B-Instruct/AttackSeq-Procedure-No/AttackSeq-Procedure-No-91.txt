### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C server about these files only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives, that are inserted into the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration, including IP addresses.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files and other system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor collects files from removable media and notifies the C&C server only after obtaining the local IP address and system time.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** The backdoor collects files from removable media.
       - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** The backdoor discovers the local IP address.
       - **T1005-Data from Local System:** The backdoor collects other system information, which can include the system time.
     - The sequence of collecting files from removable media and then discovering system information before notifying the C&C server is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor does not follow the described sequence.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that the backdoor does collect data from removable media and discover system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
