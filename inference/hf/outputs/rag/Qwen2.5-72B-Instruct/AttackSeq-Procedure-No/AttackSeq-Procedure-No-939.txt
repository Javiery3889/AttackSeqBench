### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether The Darkhotel APT is likely to gain victim credentials using an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services after deploying a keylogger module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, such as passwords and other credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also listed under the Credential Access tactic, indicating that keylogging is used to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Module:** The keylogger module is designed to capture keystrokes, which can include passwords and other sensitive information. This aligns with the T1056.001-Keylogging technique.
   - **Information Stealer Module:** The information stealer module is typically used to target stored secrets in browsers and email services. This is a logical next step after deploying a keylogger, as it can help gather additional credentials and sensitive data that may not be captured by keylogging alone.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** Deploying a keylogger first to capture real-time keystrokes and then using an information stealer to target stored secrets is a common and effective strategy for APT groups like The Darkhotel. This sequence allows them to gather both real-time and stored credentials, increasing their chances of success.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is highly likely that The Darkhotel APT would use an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services after deploying a keylogger module.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
