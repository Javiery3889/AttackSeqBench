### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. These messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges to trick the victims.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves attackers impersonating legitimate entities to gain trust and access.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts:** This technique involves compromising accounts to gain unauthorized access.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This sub-technique specifically involves compromising email accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Impersonation (T1656):** The attackers are using social engineering to impersonate technical support or friends, which aligns with the initial step of delivering phishing messages.
   - **Compromise Accounts (T1586):** After gaining initial access through phishing, the attackers would likely compromise the accounts to gain control.
   - **Email Accounts (T1586.002):** Compromising email accounts is a common step in phishing attacks to gain further access and credentials.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Changing Passwords Only:** If the attackers change the passwords only, they would lock out the original owners, but this would not necessarily align with the goal of collecting additional credentials.
   - **Using Phishing Sites:** After gaining initial access, it is more likely that the attackers would use phishing sites to collect additional credentials (Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials) to expand their control and gather more information.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (changing passwords only before using phishing sites) is not the most plausible. Typically, attackers would use the compromised accounts to set up phishing sites and collect more credentials, rather than just changing passwords and stopping there.

### Final Answer: B: No
