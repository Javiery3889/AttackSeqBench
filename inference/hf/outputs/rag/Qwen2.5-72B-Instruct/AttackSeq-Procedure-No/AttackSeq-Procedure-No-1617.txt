### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin, after monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic, is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Network Sniffing (T1040):** This is the initial step mentioned in the question, where Regin monitors and sniffs network traffic.
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** This technique aligns with gathering information about the system, which can include memory utilization and other system details.
   - **Process Discovery (T1057):** This technique aligns with gathering information about running processes, which can include memory utilization and other process details.

   - The question also mentions scanning for deleted files, but this specific technique is not listed in the related TTPs. However, the discovery phase often involves a broad range of information gathering, and scanning for deleted files could be a part of a more comprehensive discovery effort.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization during the discovery phase. The techniques T1082 and T1057 support this.
   - While scanning for deleted files is not explicitly mentioned, it is a plausible activity during the discovery phase, especially for a sophisticated malware like Regin.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
