### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SBDH malware:
     - It uses powerful filters to collect targeted data based on specific criteria (file extension, creation date, file size).
     - It then needs to communicate this data with its Command and Control (C&C) server.
   - The question asks whether the malware will likely incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding during network communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.001-Junk Data:**
     - This technique involves adding junk data to encoded strings to make it harder for defenders to decode the data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1205.002-Socket Filters:**
     - This technique involves using socket filters to control and manipulate network traffic, which can be used to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings.
     - This aligns with the T1001.001-Junk Data technique, which is specifically designed to prevent trivial decoding of network communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not incorporate junk data into encoded strings.
     - This does not align with the T1001.001-Junk Data technique, which is a common method to obfuscate network communications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the SBDH malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding for network communication with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
