### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus Group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Executing malicious macros in a Word document.
     - Using the KernelCallbackTable for control flow hijacking.
     - Achieving persistence via IMAPLoader using AppDomainManager injection.
     - Evading detection by using the Windows Update client for execution and leveraging GitHub for command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate processes to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
     - This sub-technique involves using the KernelCallbackTable to hijack execution flow at the kernel level.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
     - This sub-technique is also used for defense evasion by hijacking execution flow at the kernel level.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Executing Malicious Macros in Word Document:**
     - This is a common initial infection vector used by many threat actors, including the Lazarus Group.
   - **Using KernelCallbackTable for Control Flow Hijacking:**
     - This aligns with the related TTPs T1574.013, which is used for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **Achieving Persistence via IMAPLoader using AppDomainManager Injection:**
     - IMAPLoader is a known persistence mechanism used by the Lazarus Group. AppDomainManager injection is a technique that can be used to achieve persistence by injecting code into the .NET runtime.
   - **Evading Detection:**
     - Using the Windows Update client for execution and leveraging GitHub for C2 communication are both techniques used to evade detection and maintain a low profile.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of the Lazarus Group.
   - The use of KernelCallbackTable for control flow hijacking, followed by persistence via IMAPLoader and AppDomainManager injection, and then evading detection using the Windows Update client and GitHub for C2, is a sophisticated and well-documented attack sequence.
