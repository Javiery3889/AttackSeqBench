### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers used heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload before inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves placing malicious code on a website that is likely to be visited by the target. When the target visits the site, the code is executed, often without the user's knowledge.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:**
     - This technique involves using JavaScript to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. JavaScript can be used to perform various malicious activities, including redirecting the user to an exploit landing page.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Heap Spraying:**
     - Heap spraying is a technique used to increase the likelihood of successful exploitation by filling the heap with a specific pattern of data, often including shellcode. This technique is typically used in conjunction with vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code execution, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
   - **CVE-2019-13720:**
     - This vulnerability in Google Chrome is a use-after-free vulnerability, which can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution. Heap spraying can be used to increase the chances of successful exploitation of such vulnerabilities.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question describes a sequence where malicious JavaScript is inserted into a news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page. This landing page likely contains the exploit for CVE-2019-13720.
     - Given that CVE-2019-13720 is a use-after-free vulnerability, it is plausible that the attackers used heap spraying techniques to increase the likelihood of successful exploitation and to execute the embedded shellcode payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the attackers used heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute the embedded shellcode payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
