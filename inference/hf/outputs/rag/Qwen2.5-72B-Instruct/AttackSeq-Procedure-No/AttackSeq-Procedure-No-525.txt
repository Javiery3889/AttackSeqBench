### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - A file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
     - The backdoor used by Dropping Elephant downloads encoded blobs.
     - These encoded blobs are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will indeed download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs:
       - **T1059.001-PowerShell** indicates the use of PowerShell for execution.
       - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** indicates the use of deobfuscation or decoding to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as both T1059.001 and T1140 are relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the description in the question and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
