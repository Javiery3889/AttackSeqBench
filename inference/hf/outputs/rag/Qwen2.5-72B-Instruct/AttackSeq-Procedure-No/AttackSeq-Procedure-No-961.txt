### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus Group's malware will communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains using the HTTP protocol only before moving laterally.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using HTTP only before moving laterally.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not communicate with C2 servers using HTTP only before moving laterally.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - The T1071.001 technique indicates that the malware can use HTTP for C2 communication. However, it does not specify that HTTP is the only protocol used.
     - Advanced threat actors like the Lazarus Group often use multiple protocols and techniques to evade detection and ensure robust communication.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The T1570 technique indicates that the malware can transfer tools or files to move laterally within the network.
     - Lateral movement can occur at various stages of the attack, not necessarily after C2 communication using HTTP only.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the Lazarus Group is known for sophisticated and multi-faceted attacks, it is unlikely that they would limit their C2 communication to HTTP only before moving laterally. They are more likely to use a combination of protocols and techniques to maintain stealth and resilience.

### Final Answer: B: No
