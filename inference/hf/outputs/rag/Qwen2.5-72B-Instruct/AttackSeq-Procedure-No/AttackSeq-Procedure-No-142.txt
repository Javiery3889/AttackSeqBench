### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase, following an attack that leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves the collection of credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves gathering information about domain properties, which can include domain names, IP addresses, and other network-related information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique is directly related to the collection of user credentials. If the attackers had access to the network via the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, they could have used this access to harvest credentials from the network.
   - **T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique is more about gathering information about the network infrastructure, which is useful for understanding the target environment but does not directly involve credential harvesting.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attackers had already gained initial access through an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8, they would have had the opportunity to explore the network and collect credentials.
   - Harvesting credentials (T1589.001) is a common next step after gaining initial access, as it allows attackers to maintain persistence and move laterally within the network.
   - While gathering domain properties (T1590.001) is also a useful reconnaissance technique, it is not as directly related to the question of whether credentials were harvested.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
