### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the lightSpy malware performing data collection on various types of data (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data).
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to use DNS Calculation by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine the command and control (C2) port for module updates and data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering network configuration details, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.003-DNS Calculation:**
     - This technique involves using DNS to calculate or determine the C2 server or port.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving the C2 server or port, which can include various methods such as DNS, HTTP, or other protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Collection:**
     - The malware is described as performing data collection, which aligns with the Discovery tactic and the T1016 technique (System Network Configuration Discovery). This is a common step for malware to gather information about the victim's system and network.
   - **DNS Calculation:**
     - The question specifically mentions DNS Calculation, which is a technique (T1568.003) used to determine the C2 server or port. This technique involves using DNS to perform calculations or lookups to dynamically resolve the C2 server or port.
   - **Dynamic Resolution:**
     - The broader technique of Dynamic Resolution (T1568) includes various methods for dynamically determining the C2 server or port, which can include DNS Calculation.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the question mentions DNS Calculation and the related TTPs include both DNS Calculation (T1568.003) and Dynamic Resolution (T1568), it is plausible that the lightSpy malware would use DNS Calculation to determine the C2 port for module updates and data exfiltration.
   - The specific method described (multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet) is a form of DNS Calculation, which fits within the broader context of dynamic resolution techniques.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
