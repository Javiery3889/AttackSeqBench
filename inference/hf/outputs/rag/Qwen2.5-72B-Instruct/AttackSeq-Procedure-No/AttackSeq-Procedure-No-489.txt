### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files (Discovery phase) only after dumping credentials (Credential Access phase) using a custom version of Mimikatz.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, often using tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - **Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping):** This is typically done to gain additional access to the system or to move laterally within the network.
     - **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery):** This is done to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Logical Order:**
     - It is common for an attacker to first gain initial access and then perform credential dumping to escalate privileges or move laterally. Once they have the necessary credentials, they can then perform discovery to gather more information about the system and network.
     - However, the question specifically asks if the discovery phase (collecting system information and probing files) happens **only** after credential dumping.
   - **FamousSparrow's Behavior:**
     - FamousSparrow is known for using a custom version of Mimikatz for credential dumping, but it is also known to perform discovery activities to understand the environment. The sequence of these activities can vary, but it is not strictly necessary for discovery to happen only after credential dumping.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that discovery activities can occur at various stages of the attack, and it is not strictly necessary for discovery to happen only after credential dumping, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
