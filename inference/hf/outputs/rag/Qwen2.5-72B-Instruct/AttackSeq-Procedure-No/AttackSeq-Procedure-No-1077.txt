### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after the PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server via the domain `hxxp://outl00k[.]net`, the campaign would only then execute PowerShell scripts triggered by the macro in the Word document and employ obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which is a common method for running scripts and commands.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VB) scripts, which are often used in macros within Office documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Initial Communication with C&C Server:** The PRB-Backdoor communicates with the C&C server via the domain `hxxp://outl00k[.]net`. This is a common initial step in many malware campaigns to establish a command and control channel.
     - **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:** After establishing communication with the C&C server, it is plausible that the malware would then execute additional payloads, such as PowerShell scripts. This is a common tactic to perform further actions, such as downloading additional malware or executing commands.
     - **Use of Obfuscated Macros:** The use of obfuscated macros in Word documents is a common technique for defense evasion. These macros can trigger the execution of PowerShell scripts or other malicious actions.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical behavior of malware campaigns. It is common for malware to establish a C&C connection first and then execute additional payloads, such as PowerShell scripts, which can be triggered by macros in Office documents.
     - The use of obfuscated macros for defense evasion is a well-known technique and fits well into the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
