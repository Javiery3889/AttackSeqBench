### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`).
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control (C2) instead of njRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves adversaries using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including executing malicious code and establishing C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Telnet for C2:**
     - Telnet is a simple and unencrypted protocol that is rarely used for C2 in modern malware. It is not a common choice for C2 because it lacks encryption and is easily detectable.
   - **njRAT for C2:**
     - njRAT (also known as Bladabindi) is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that is commonly used for C2. It is more sophisticated and often includes features like encryption and stealth to avoid detection.
   - **PowerShell and C2:**
     - PowerShell is frequently used by malware to establish C2 communications. It can be used to download and execute additional payloads, including RATs like njRAT. PowerShell scripts can also be used to establish encrypted C2 channels, which are more common and effective than using Telnet.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTP, it is more likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using a more sophisticated and common C2 method, such as njRAT, rather than Telnet.
   - Telnet is not a typical choice for C2 in modern malware, especially when a more advanced and stealthy option like njRAT is available.

### Final Answer: B: No
