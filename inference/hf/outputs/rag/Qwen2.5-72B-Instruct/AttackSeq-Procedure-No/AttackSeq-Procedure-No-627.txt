### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase after establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to communicate with C2 servers, which can include DNS and HTTP.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique specifically involves using DNS for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system, which is a common step in the Discovery phase to understand the environment and identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C2 Channel:**
     - The SombRAT backdoor used protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a C2 channel. This is consistent with the related TTPs T1572 and T1071.004.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - After establishing the C2 channel, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities to gather information about the compromised system. This includes identifying running processes and system information.
     - The related TTP T1057 (Process Discovery) is directly relevant to this phase, indicating that the malware is likely to perform process discovery to understand the environment and identify potential targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase after establishing the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
