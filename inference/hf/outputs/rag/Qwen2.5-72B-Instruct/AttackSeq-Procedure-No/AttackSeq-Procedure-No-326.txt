### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The app hides its icon and runs in the background.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app will use `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` to identify Domain Administrators before sending gathered information (including processes data) to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1069.002-Domain Groups:** This technique involves querying domain groups to identify members, such as Domain Administrators.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.002-Domain Account:** This technique involves querying domain accounts to gather information about user accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Context of the XAgent App:**
     - The XAgent app is running on iOS 7 devices.
     - iOS devices do not have a built-in `net.exe` command, which is a Windows command-line tool.
     - The `net.exe` command is used in Windows environments to manage network resources, including domain groups and accounts.
   - **Relevance of the TTPs:**
     - The TTPs T1069.002 and T1087.002 are relevant to Windows environments, not iOS.
     - On iOS, the app would likely use different methods to gather information, such as accessing the device's APIs or using other built-in tools.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the XAgent app is running on iOS 7 and `net.exe` is a Windows-specific command, it is highly unlikely that the app would use `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` to identify Domain Administrators.
   - The app would use iOS-specific methods to gather information and send it to the C2 server.

### Final Answer: B: No
