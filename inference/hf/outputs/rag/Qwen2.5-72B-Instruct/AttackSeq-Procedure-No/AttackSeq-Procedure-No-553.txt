### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the skip-2.0 backdoor, after being launched with a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion, is likely to execute using the SessionEnv service and achieve persistence through DLL hijacking of the TSVIPSrv.DLL file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL, causing the system to load the malicious DLL instead.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate application by exploiting the way the application loads its dependencies.
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking (Persistence):** This technique is used for persistence by ensuring that the malicious DLL is loaded every time the legitimate application runs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **VMProtected Launcher for Defense Evasion:** The use of a VMProtected launcher is a common technique to evade detection by security software. This aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion.
   - **SessionEnv Service:** The SessionEnv service is a legitimate Windows service. If the skip-2.0 backdoor is designed to execute using this service, it suggests that the backdoor is leveraging a known service to run its malicious code.
   - **DLL Hijacking of TSVIPSrv.DLL:** The TSVIPSrv.DLL file is a legitimate DLL used by the Remote Desktop Services. If the backdoor is hijacking this DLL, it aligns with the T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking technique for both defense evasion and persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion, which is consistent with the Tactic: Defense Evasion.
   - The backdoor executing using the SessionEnv service and achieving persistence through DLL hijacking of TSVIPSrv.DLL aligns with the T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking technique for both defense evasion and persistence.
