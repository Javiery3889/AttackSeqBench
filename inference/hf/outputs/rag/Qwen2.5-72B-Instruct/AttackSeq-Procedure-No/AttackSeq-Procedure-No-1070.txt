### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Equation Editor Exploits:** These are known to be used by Tropic Trooper to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Installer Package with Malicious Payloads:** This is a common next step after gaining initial access, where the attacker deploys additional malware.
   - **RegAsm.exe:** This is a utility used to register .NET assemblies. It is not typically used for direct malicious activity but can be used to register malicious .NET assemblies.
   - **Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001):** This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a running process, such as dllhost.exe, to execute code in the context of that process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Exploit and Payload Execution:** Tropic Trooper uses Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. This is a common initial step in their attack chain.
   - **RegAsm.exe Usage:** While RegAsm.exe can be used to register malicious .NET assemblies, it is not a typical step in the sequence described. The question does not provide specific evidence that Tropic Trooper uses RegAsm.exe in this context.
   - **DLL Injection:** The related TTP (T1055.001) indicates that Tropic Trooper is likely to inject a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack. This is a common technique for maintaining persistence and evading detection.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (using RegAsm.exe before DLL injection) is not the most plausible based on the related TTPs and typical attack patterns of Tropic Trooper.

### Final Answer: B: No
