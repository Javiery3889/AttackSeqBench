### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Chisel malware, after replacing the legitimate `netd` service, will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data from a compromised system. This can be done at regular intervals or triggered by specific events.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can include various protocols and services, such as SSH, HTTP, or Tor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Chisel malware will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
     - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** supports the idea of automatic exfiltration at regular intervals.
     - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** supports the use of a C2 channel, which can include Tor and SSH.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Chisel malware will not automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that automated exfiltration and exfiltration over C2 channels are common techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Chisel malware will indeed automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
