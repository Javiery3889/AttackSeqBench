### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Sayad malware is likely to capture screenshots only after performing discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host, following the exfiltration of collected and encrypted data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots to gather visual information from the compromised host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Collected and Encrypted Data:**
     - The question states that the malware has already exfiltrated the collected and encrypted data. This aligns with the T1560 technique, which involves archiving and exfiltrating data.
   - **Discovery and System Information Collection:**
     - The question mentions performing discovery by collecting system and application details. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
   - **Screen Capture:**
     - The question asks if the malware is likely to capture screenshots only after performing discovery. Screen capture (T1113) is a technique used to gather visual information, which can be valuable for further exploitation or reconnaissance.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Typically, after exfiltrating data, an attacker might perform discovery to understand the environment better. This discovery phase often includes collecting system and application details.
     - Once the attacker has a better understanding of the environment, they might proceed with more specific data collection techniques, such as screen capture, to gather additional information.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that the malware would perform discovery before capturing screenshots because the discovery phase provides context and valuable information that can guide further actions.
     - Capturing screenshots without prior discovery might be less effective and could miss important details.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
