### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information (discovery) only after ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder (persistence).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This suggests that the implant may perform discovery activities, such as checking for internet connectivity.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This indicates that the implant may ensure persistence by adding itself to the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the implant will fetch computer name and user name information only after ensuring persistence.
     - However, the related TTPs do not explicitly state that discovery activities (fetching computer name and user name) are performed only after ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the implant does not necessarily fetch computer name and user name information only after ensuring persistence.
     - The related TTPs indicate that discovery activities and persistence are separate steps, and there is no explicit order specified.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that the implant performs command and control, discovery, and persistence activities. However, they do not specify that discovery activities are performed only after ensuring persistence.
   - It is more plausible that the implant may perform discovery activities at any point during its operation, not necessarily only after ensuring persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
