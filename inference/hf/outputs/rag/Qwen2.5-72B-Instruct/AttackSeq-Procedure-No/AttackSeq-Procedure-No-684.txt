### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers:
     - Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     - Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - Deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.
     - Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Impact**
     - **Technique: T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery**
       - This technique involves actions that prevent or impede the recovery of a system, such as deleting shadow volumes to prevent restoration from backups.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers gain initial access by exploiting exposed Docker API ports. This is a common method for gaining access to a system.
   - **Resource Hijacking:**
     - The ultimate objective is to hijack resources using malicious container images. This is a common goal in attacks targeting Docker environments.
   - **Deleting Shadow Volumes:**
     - Deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` is a technique used to inhibit system recovery (T1490). This is typically done to prevent the victim from restoring the system to a previous state, which could undo the attacker's actions.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Deploy worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     2. Exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     3. Delete shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.
     4. Achieve resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - The deletion of shadow volumes (T1490) is a logical step to take after gaining initial access and before achieving the ultimate objective. It helps to ensure that the system cannot be easily restored, making the attacker's actions more persistent and harder to reverse.

### Final Answer:
**Final Answer: A: Yes**
