### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that cybercriminals collected the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture of an infected host after using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082 - System Information Discovery**
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery** involves adversaries collecting information about the system and its environment, including the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture. This information is crucial for further exploitation and maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the cybercriminals collected the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture.
     - Given the related TTP (T1082 - System Information Discovery), it is highly plausible that after identifying potential entry points, the cybercriminals would proceed to gather detailed system information to better understand the target environment.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the cybercriminals collected the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture.
     - This choice is less plausible because collecting such information is a common and essential step in the discovery phase of an attack, as indicated by the related TTP.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTP, the most plausible answer is that the cybercriminals did collect the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture of the infected host.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
