### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending emails with links to malicious websites or files.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, such as documents that contain macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** is directly relevant to the scenario described in the question. It involves sending emails with malicious attachments, such as the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file, which can contain VBS macros.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** is also a method of initial access but involves links rather than attachments. This technique is not directly relevant to the scenario where the malicious document is the initial access point.
   - The question specifically mentions that the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. This aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - The execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document is a subsequent step that occurs after the initial access is gained through the malicious attachment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. The initial access is gained through the phishing email with the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file, and then the VBS macros are executed from the embedded document.
   - Therefore, the answer is: **B: No**.

Final Answer: B: No
