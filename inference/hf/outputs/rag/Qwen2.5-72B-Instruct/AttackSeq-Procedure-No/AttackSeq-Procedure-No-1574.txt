### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after scanning for machines in the target's network environment, Earth Lusca will gather account credentials via a BlackEnergy keylogger plugin before exploiting remote services for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which aligns with the initial scanning activity mentioned in the question.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services running on systems, which is also part of the initial scanning activity.
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials, which is mentioned in the question as the next step using a BlackEnergy keylogger plugin.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Scanning:**
     - The question mentions using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan, which align with the T1018 and T1046 techniques for discovering remote systems and network services.
   - **Gathering Credentials:**
     - The question then asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will gather account credentials using a BlackEnergy keylogger plugin. The T1589.001 technique supports this step.
   - **Exploiting Remote Services:**
     - The question also mentions exploiting remote services for lateral movement, which is a common next step after gathering credentials.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (scanning for machines, gathering credentials, and then exploiting remote services) is a logical and common attack pattern.
   - The related TTPs support each step of this sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
