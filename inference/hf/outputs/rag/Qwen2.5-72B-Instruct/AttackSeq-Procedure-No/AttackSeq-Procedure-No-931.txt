### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion only after deploying malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers during execution.
   - The sequence of actions described includes:
     - Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access.
     - Deploying malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers.
     - Using sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, which is a form of data collection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
     - This technique involves signing malicious code with a digital certificate to evade detection by security software.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique is listed again, emphasizing the importance of keylogging for credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (T1056.001-Keylogging):**
     - The Darkhotel APT is known to target stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access. Keylogging is a common method for this.
   - **Malware Deployment:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for APTs to deploy additional malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or keyloggers to further their objectives.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1553.002-Code Signing):**
     - Once the APT has established a foothold and deployed malware, they may use sophisticated techniques like code signing to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Data Encryption:**
     - Encrypting gathered data in log files is a common defense evasion technique to prevent detection and analysis of exfiltrated data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical behavior of APTs, including Darkhotel. They often start with credential access, deploy additional malware, and then use sophisticated techniques for defense evasion.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, particularly the use of keylogging for credential access and code signing for defense evasion.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
