### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the threat actor "Earth Lusca" is likely to establish persistence on compromised systems through account manipulation and the creation of scheduled tasks after using application layer protocols and data obfuscation techniques for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect malicious activity.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to ensure that malicious code or actions are executed at specific times, maintaining persistence on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (T1001.003):**
     - The use of protocol or service impersonation for command and control is a common tactic to evade detection by security systems. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005):**
     - Creating scheduled tasks is a well-known method for establishing persistence on a compromised system. This aligns with the second part of the question, which asks about establishing persistence through scheduled tasks.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Earth Lusca uses data obfuscation techniques to evade detection and then establishes persistence. The related TTPs confirm that both techniques (T1001.003 and T1053.005) are relevant and commonly used in such scenarios.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Earth Lusca would use these techniques in sequence to achieve their goals.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
