### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor will exfiltrate files to the C&C server only before compressing them, after performing certain discovery and collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the backdoor obtaining the system time and time zone.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves the backdoor collecting data from the local system, such as file and directory listings.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the backdoor exfiltrating data to a C2 (Command and Control) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will exfiltrate files to the C2 server before compressing them.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will not exfiltrate files to the C2 server before compressing them.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the backdoor performs discovery (T1124) and collection (T1005) activities before exfiltration (T1041).
   - Typically, in a well-designed exfiltration process, data is often compressed before exfiltration to reduce the size of the data being transferred and to potentially obfuscate the content.
   - Compressing data before exfiltration is a common practice in malware to make the exfiltration process more efficient and less detectable.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that the backdoor will compress the files before exfiltrating them to the C2 server.

### Final Answer: B: No
