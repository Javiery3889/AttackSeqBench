### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries compromised legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor before exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) through spear phishing emails to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious websites or files.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the adversaries compromised legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor before using the spear phishing emails to exploit the Microsoft Office vulnerability.
     - Compromising legitimate web browser updates is a sophisticated and less common method. It typically involves a high level of access and control over the update process, which is not typically associated with the initial stages of a spear phishing attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the adversaries did not compromise legitimate web browser updates and instead directly used spear phishing emails to exploit the Microsoft Office vulnerability.
     - The related TTPs (T1566.002 and T1566.001) clearly indicate that spear phishing is the primary method used for initial access. The technique T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) is relevant to the exploitation of the Microsoft Office vulnerability, which is consistent with the spear phishing method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical attack patterns, it is more plausible that the adversaries used spear phishing emails directly to exploit the Microsoft Office vulnerability without compromising legitimate web browser updates.

**Final Answer: B: No**
