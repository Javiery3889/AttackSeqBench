### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C&C) communication.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of protocols that are not typically used for application-layer communication, such as custom TCP-based protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that the Korplug variant uses a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communication, with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and then collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
     - The related TTPs support this answer:
       - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** indicates the use of a custom TCP-based protocol.
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** suggests that the initial handshake could be over HTTPS, which is a web protocol.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the Korplug variant does not use a custom TCP-based protocol with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP before collecting data.
     - This answer does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate the use of both custom TCP-based protocols and web protocols.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Korplug variant does use a custom TCP-based protocol with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP before collecting data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
