### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT42 is likely to conduct reconnaissance (specifically through spear-phishing and surveillance) only after using virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques for defense evasion, following credential harvesting through social engineering.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using spear-phishing to gather information about a target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials as part of reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Harvesting through Social Engineering:**
     - This aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique, where APT42 uses phishing to harvest credentials.
   - **Reconnaissance through Spear-Phishing and Surveillance:**
     - This aligns with the T1598.001-Spearphishing Service and T1589.001-Credentials techniques, where APT42 uses spear-phishing to gather more information and credentials.
   - **Virtualization or Sandbox Evasion:**
     - This is a defense evasion technique (T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion) that is typically used to avoid detection by security systems. It is not a prerequisite for reconnaissance or initial access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that APT42 would first harvest credentials through social engineering (phishing), and then conduct reconnaissance through spear-phishing and surveillance.
   - The use of virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques is not a necessary step before conducting reconnaissance. These techniques are more commonly used to avoid detection during the execution of the attack, not as a prerequisite for reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that APT42 would conduct reconnaissance only after using virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques.

### Final Answer:
B: No
