### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the OceanLotus Group will use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for command-and-control (C2) communication before performing lateral movement using stolen credentials and leveraging Windows built-in tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using the DNS protocol for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH):** DoH is a method of encrypting DNS queries and responses over HTTPS. It is a more advanced and less common method of C2 communication compared to traditional DNS or web protocols.
   - **OceanLotus Group:** This group is known for using sophisticated techniques, including DNS tunneling and web protocols for C2 communication. However, the use of DoH is relatively new and not as widely adopted.
   - **Lateral Movement using Stolen Credentials and Windows Built-in Tools:** This is a common technique used by many advanced threat actors, including the OceanLotus Group, to move laterally within a network.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes:** This suggests that the OceanLotus Group will use DoH for C2 communication before performing lateral movement.
   - **Answer B: No:** This suggests that the OceanLotus Group will not use DoH for C2 communication before performing lateral movement.

### Final Reasoning:
- The OceanLotus Group is known for using sophisticated techniques, but the use of DoH is relatively new and not as widely adopted as traditional DNS or web protocols.
- The group is more likely to use established methods like DNS tunneling (T1071.004) or web protocols (T1071.001) for C2 communication.
- Given the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the group would use these established methods rather than the more advanced and less common DoH.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
