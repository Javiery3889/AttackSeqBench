### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlackSoul, after communicating with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON-based data encoding, is likely to perform file transfers and execute commands only after gathering browser data (usernames and passwords) from the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
   - This TTP indicates that the malware (BlackSoul) is capable of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which is consistent with the communication described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that BlackSoul will perform file transfers and execute commands only after gathering browser data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that BlackSoul will not necessarily perform file transfers and execute commands only after gathering browser data.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) indicates that the malware can exfiltrate data over the C2 channel, but it does not specify the order of operations.
   - Typically, malware like BlackSoul might gather browser data (usernames and passwords) as part of its data exfiltration process, but it is not necessarily a prerequisite for performing file transfers or executing commands.
   - The sequence described in the question (gathering browser data before file transfers and command execution) is a possible scenario, but it is not the only possible sequence. Malware can perform these actions in various orders depending on the specific implementation and the attacker's objectives.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the flexibility in the order of operations and the lack of specific information in the T1041 technique about the sequence, it is more accurate to say that BlackSoul is not necessarily constrained to perform file transfers and execute commands only after gathering browser data.

### Final Answer: B: No
