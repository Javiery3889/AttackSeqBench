### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware after stealing Google Chrome credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the part of the question about iterating through password stores and stealing Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands, which could be used to download additional malware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information, which aligns with the part of the question about decoding encoded blobs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to use the described techniques to evade defenses.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1555.003** (Credentials from Web Browsers) confirms the initial step of stealing credentials.
       - **T1059.001** (PowerShell) confirms the use of PowerShell for execution.
       - **T1140** (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) confirms the decoding of encoded blobs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is not likely to use the described techniques to evade defenses.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as all three TTPs align with the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to use the described techniques to evade defenses.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
