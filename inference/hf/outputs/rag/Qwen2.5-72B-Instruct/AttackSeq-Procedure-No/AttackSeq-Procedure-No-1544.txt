### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry, the malware will perform cloud infrastructure discovery by enumerating AWS infrastructure before establishing command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves creating a registry key or placing a file in a startup folder to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware enumerating cloud infrastructure, such as AWS EC2 instances, to gather information about the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001):**
     - Creating a RunOnce key in the registry is a common method for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malware will run every time the system starts.
   - **Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580):**
     - After achieving persistence, the malware might perform discovery to understand the environment it is in. This can include enumerating cloud infrastructure to identify potential targets or resources.
   - **Command and Control (C2) through Process Hollowing:**
     - Establishing C2 is a critical step for the malware to communicate with the attacker. Process Hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection and establish communication with the C2 server.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001) → Discovery (T1580) → C2 (Process Hollowing):**
     - It is logical for the malware to first ensure it can persist on the system. Once persistence is established, the malware might perform discovery to understand the environment, including cloud infrastructure. Finally, the malware would establish C2 to communicate with the attacker.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (Persistence → Cloud Infrastructure Discovery → C2) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
