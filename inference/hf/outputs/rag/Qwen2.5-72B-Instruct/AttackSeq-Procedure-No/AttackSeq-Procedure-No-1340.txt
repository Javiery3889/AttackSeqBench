### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers rebooted the target system after completing the wiping processes instead of launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.
   - The key points are:
     - Use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
     - Wiping processes.
     - Rebooting the system.
     - Launching DDoS attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves using single-byte XOR encoding to obfuscate configuration files, which is consistent with the observed behavior in the question.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service:**
     - This technique involves causing a denial of service on endpoints, which aligns with the DDoS attacks mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers rebooted the system after the wiping processes.
     - While rebooting a system after wiping processes can be a part of an attack to ensure the system is in a known state or to cover tracks, it does not align with the primary goal of causing a 'total failure' of Next Media's network through DDoS attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers did not reboot the system and instead launched DDoS attacks.
     - The use of DDoS attacks to cause a 'total failure' of Next Media's network aligns with the impact technique T1499, which is listed in the related TTPs.
     - The question mentions that the attackers were observed using XOR keys to encode configuration files, which is consistent with the defense evasion technique T1027.013.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers did not reboot the system but instead launched DDoS attacks to cause a 'total failure' of Next Media's network.

**Final Answer: B: No**
