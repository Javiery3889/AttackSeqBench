### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only after deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which can be done through various methods such as pinging, port scanning, and using network scanning tools.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services running on remote systems, which can be done by querying network services, using network scanning tools, and other methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deployment of pr.dll:** The deployment of additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server is typically part of the **Exfiltration** phase of the attack lifecycle.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The discovery phase, which includes techniques like T1018 and T1046, is generally performed earlier in the attack lifecycle to understand the network environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Initial Compromise:** The attacker gains initial access to the network.
     - **Discovery:** The attacker performs discovery to understand the network and identify valuable targets.
     - **Lateral Movement:** The attacker moves laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems.
     - **Exfiltration:** The attacker deploys modules like pr.dll to exfiltrate stolen data to the C&C server.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical sequence of events in an APT28 attack, it is unlikely that APT28 would perform discovery (scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems) only after deploying pr.dll to exfiltrate data. Discovery is usually performed earlier in the attack lifecycle to gather the necessary information for further actions.

### Final Answer: B: No
