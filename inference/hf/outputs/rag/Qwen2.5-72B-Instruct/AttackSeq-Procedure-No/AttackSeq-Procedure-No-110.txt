### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques after persistence is established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick internal users into executing malicious actions, such as clicking on a link or opening a file.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves moving tools or files across the network to other systems to facilitate further actions, such as lateral movement or additional exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** directly supports the idea of moving tools or files across the network.
       - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing** can be used to trick internal users into executing these transferred tools, making it a plausible sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that both lateral tool transfer and internal spearphishing are techniques that can be used together in an attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that it is likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
