### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla, after establishing persistence, will use a rootkit for defense evasion only after downloading specialized tools like password stealers for the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit:** This technique involves the use of rootkits to hide the presence of malware and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:** Turla is known for establishing a hidden foothold in infected networks, which is a form of persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion with Rootkit:** The use of a rootkit (T1014) is a common technique for defense evasion, which helps the malware remain undetected.
   - **Collection Phase and Specialized Tools:** The collection phase involves gathering sensitive information, and specialized tools like password stealers are often used for this purpose.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Turla typically uses a rootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection from the very beginning of the infection. This is a standard practice to ensure that the malware remains hidden and can operate undetected for extended periods.
   - The use of specialized tools like password stealers is part of the collection phase, which occurs after the initial infection and persistence have been established.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that Turla would wait until the collection phase to deploy a rootkit for defense evasion. The rootkit would be deployed as part of the initial infection and persistence phase to ensure the malware remains hidden throughout the entire attack lifecycle.

### Final Answer: B: No
