### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Tildeb, after establishing network communication with its C&C server and setting up a secure communication channel, is likely to use command-line arguments to establish communication with its C&C server or listen on a TCP socket for incoming connections during execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control communication.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application-level communication (e.g., raw sockets, ICMP).
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command-Line Arguments:**
     - Command-line arguments are typically used to configure the initial behavior of a malware, such as specifying the C&C server's address or port. However, once the malware is running and has established a secure communication channel, it is less likely to use command-line arguments for ongoing communication.
   - **Listening on a TCP Socket:**
     - Listening on a TCP socket is a common method for malware to receive commands from a C&C server. This aligns with the T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication technique, which involves maintaining a two-way communication channel.
   - **Web Protocols (T1071.001):**
     - Web protocols like HTTP and HTTPS are often used for command and control communication because they are less likely to be blocked by firewalls and can blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **Non-Application Layer Protocol (T1095):**
     - Non-application layer protocols are used to avoid detection by network security systems. However, this is less common and more complex to implement compared to using web protocols.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Tildeb will listen on a TCP socket for incoming connections during execution. This aligns with the need for bidirectional communication and the use of web protocols for command and control.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
