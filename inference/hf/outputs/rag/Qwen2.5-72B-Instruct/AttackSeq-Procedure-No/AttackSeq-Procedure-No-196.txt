### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign will utilize tools to capture mouse movements after capturing credentials from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies to sell to other cybercriminals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information such as credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique is also about capturing keystrokes to gain access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing various types of input, including keystrokes and potentially mouse movements, to gather credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will use tools to capture mouse movements.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not use tools to capture mouse movements.

   - **Evaluation:**
     - The related TTPs focus on keylogging and input capture, which are primarily concerned with capturing keystrokes to gather credentials.
     - While T1056-Input Capture can include capturing mouse movements, the primary focus in the context of the RevengeHotels campaign is on capturing credentials, which is more aligned with keylogging (T1056.001).
     - Capturing mouse movements is less common and less directly related to the goal of capturing credentials for sale.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is less likely that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign will utilize tools to capture mouse movements. The primary focus is on keylogging to capture credentials.

**Final Answer: B: No**
