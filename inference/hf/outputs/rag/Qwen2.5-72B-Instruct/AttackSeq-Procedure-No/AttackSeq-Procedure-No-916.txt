### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Modifying registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office (Defense Evasion).
     2. Deactivating PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to tamper with the sshd configuration (Persistence).
     3. Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The provided TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to change system behavior, such as deactivating security mechanisms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Modifying Registry Keys to Deactivate Security Mechanisms in Microsoft Office**
     - This aligns with the provided TTP (T1112-Modify Registry) and is a common technique for Defense Evasion.
   - **Step 2: Deactivating PAM to Tamper with the sshd Configuration**
     - PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is typically used in Unix-like systems, not Windows. The question mentions tampering with the sshd configuration, which is also specific to Unix-like systems.
     - Gamaredon is known to target Windows systems, so this step seems out of place in the context of a Windows environment.
   - **Step 3: Injecting Malicious Macros into Word and Excel Documents for Lateral Movement**
     - Injecting malicious macros into Office documents is a common technique for Lateral Movement in Windows environments.
     - This step is plausible and aligns with the known tactics of Gamaredon.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question includes a step (deactivating PAM to tamper with the sshd configuration) that is not typical for a Windows environment, which is the primary target of Gamaredon.
   - The other steps (modifying registry keys and injecting malicious macros) are consistent with Gamaredon's known TTPs.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described is unlikely because it includes a step that is not typical for a Windows environment, which is the primary target of the Gamaredon group.
