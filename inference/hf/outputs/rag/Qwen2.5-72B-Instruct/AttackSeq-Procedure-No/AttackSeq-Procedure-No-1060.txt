### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a threat actor named Blind Eagle might use.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Initial access via a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
     - Using a backdoor to store configuration in a registry key for defense evasion.
     - Placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves adding or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is also about adding or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to ensure that a program runs when the system starts up.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is described as being gained via a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands. This is a common method for initial access and is plausible.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Storing configuration in a registry key is a common technique for defense evasion. It helps the malware avoid detection by hiding its configuration data.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Placing a VBScript in the Startup folder is a common persistence technique. It ensures that the malware runs every time the system starts up.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the related TTPs. After gaining initial access, the threat actor would likely use defense evasion techniques to hide their presence and then ensure persistence by placing a script in the Startup folder.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
