### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideWinder APT group.
   - The group initially exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group then installed loadable kernel modules for privilege escalation before employing techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation**
     - **Technique: T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**
   - This TTP indicates that the group used exploitation techniques to gain higher privileges on the infected machines.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The group gained initial access via CVE-2019-2215, which is a known vulnerability in Android.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The related TTP (T1068) suggests that the group used exploitation techniques to escalate privileges. Installing loadable kernel modules is a common method for privilege escalation in Linux and Android environments.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - After gaining higher privileges, it is common for APT groups to use techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the related TTP (T1068), it is highly likely that the SideWinder APT group installed loadable kernel modules to escalate privileges.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (initial access, privilege escalation, and evasion) is a common and logical progression in APT attacks.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
