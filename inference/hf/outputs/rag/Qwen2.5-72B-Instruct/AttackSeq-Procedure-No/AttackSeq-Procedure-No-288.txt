### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Elfin, after scanning for vulnerable websites, would send spear-phishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files before deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves an adversary tricking users into clicking a link that leads to a malicious file or website.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending phishing emails to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending targeted phishing emails with links to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin would send spear-phishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files before deploying malware tools.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique aligns with sending targeted phishing emails with links to malicious content.
       - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique aligns with tricking users into clicking a link that leads to a malicious file or website.
     - After gaining initial access through spear-phishing, it is common for adversaries to deploy malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for further execution and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin would not send spear-phishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files before deploying malware tools.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate the use of spear-phishing and malicious links as part of the initial access and execution tactics.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible answer is that Elfin would send spear-phishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files before deploying malware tools.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
