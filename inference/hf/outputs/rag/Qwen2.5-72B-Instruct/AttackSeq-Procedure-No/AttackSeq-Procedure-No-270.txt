### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant will use ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for Command and Control (C2) communications after collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, etc.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, registry entries, and other system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs focus on the **Collection** phase of the attack, specifically on how the malware collects data from the local system and removable media.
   - The question, however, is asking about the **Command and Control (C2)** phase, specifically whether ICMP is used for C2 communications.
   - The provided TTPs do not mention anything about C2 communications or the use of ICMP. They only describe the data collection methods.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Since the related TTPs do not provide any information about the C2 communications or the use of ICMP, and the question is specifically asking about C2 communications, we cannot infer that the Korplug variant will use ICMP for C2 based on the given information.

**Final Answer: B: No**
