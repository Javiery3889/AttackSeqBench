### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     - Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks using Mimikatz PowerShell for credential access.
     - Extracting emails from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.
     - Logging keystrokes on the victim’s machine.
     - Securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves logging keystrokes to capture sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**
     - This technique involves attacking the AS-REP (Authentication Service-Request) to obtain user credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This is a duplicate of the keylogging technique, emphasizing its importance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks using Mimikatz PowerShell:**
     - This is a common technique for credential access, allowing attackers to use valid Kerberos tickets to authenticate to services.
   - **Extracting emails from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials:**
     - Once credentials are obtained, attackers can use them to access and extract emails from the MS Exchange Server.
   - **Logging keystrokes on the victim’s machine:**
     - Keylogging is a technique used to capture keystrokes, which can be used to gather additional credentials or sensitive information.
   - **Securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption:**
     - This is a common method for exfiltrating data and maintaining command and control (C&C) communication.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     - **Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks** and **extracting emails** are both part of the credential access and collection tactics.
     - **Keylogging** is a common follow-up action to gather more credentials or sensitive information.
     - **Secure communication with the C&C server** is a standard practice to exfiltrate data and maintain control.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility of the sequence and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most likely answer is that the Duke group will log keystrokes on the victim’s machine before securely communicating with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
