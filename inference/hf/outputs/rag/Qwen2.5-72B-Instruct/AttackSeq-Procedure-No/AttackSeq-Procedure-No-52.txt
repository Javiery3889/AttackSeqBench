### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to collect data from removable media devices after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement, and then exfiltrate the data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media devices such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to execute commands and scripts, often for lateral movement and other malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement with WMIC (T1047):** The question mentions that the Lazarus group has already used WMIC for lateral movement. This is a common technique for moving through a network and gaining access to different systems.
   - **Data Collection from Removable Media (T1025):** The question then asks if the group is likely to collect data from removable media devices. This is a plausible next step in the attack sequence, as collecting data from removable media can be a way to gather sensitive information that might not be available through network-based methods.
   - **Exfiltration through a Covert Channel:** The final part of the question involves exfiltrating the collected data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool. This is a common method for stealthily transferring data out of a network without being detected.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs, it is reasonable to assume that after establishing network connections and moving laterally, the Lazarus group would collect data from various sources, including removable media, to ensure they gather as much sensitive information as possible.
   - The use of a custom tunneling tool for exfiltration aligns with the group's sophisticated and stealthy approach to cyber operations.

### Final Answer:
