### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where Darkhotel APT seeds Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware.
   - It then asks if Darkhotel APT is likely to use Visual Basic or create VBScripts to execute malicious code before maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique indicates that the use of Visual Basic (VB) or VBScripts is a known method for executing malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Darkhotel APT seeds P2P sharing sites with malware, which is a common initial access technique.
   - **Execution:**
     - The related TTP (T1059.005-Visual Basic) suggests that using Visual Basic or VBScripts to execute malicious code is a known technique.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Adding autorun registry settings is a common method for maintaining persistence, which aligns with the question's description.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the related TTP (T1059.005-Visual Basic) is listed and it is a known technique for execution, it is plausible that Darkhotel APT would use Visual Basic or VBScripts to execute malicious code.
   - The sequence of initial access, execution, and persistence through autorun registry settings is a logical and common attack pattern.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
