### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has conducted reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan to identify Building Management systems with the Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system, which is part of the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The use of tools like masscan to identify Building Management systems and unauthenticated printer web interfaces is part of the reconnaissance phase. This phase is focused on gathering information about the target environment.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase involves further exploration of the identified systems to gather more detailed information. This can include identifying file and directory paths, which is described by T1083-File and Directory Discovery.
   - **Metadata and File Listings:**
     - Once the attacker has identified the systems and their configurations, it is logical to proceed to the discovery phase to gather more detailed information, such as file and directory listings and metadata.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the discovery phase includes techniques like T1083-File and Directory Discovery, it is likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during this phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
