### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the VERMIN malware.
   - It starts with collecting system information using WMI queries.
   - Then, it asks if the keylogger component collects keystrokes and clipboard data before storing them encrypted in a specific folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system and staging it for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to collect sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Collecting System Information Using WMI Queries:**
     - This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic and the **T1012-Query Registry** technique, as WMI queries are often used to gather system information.
   - **Step 2: Keylogger Collecting Keystrokes and Clipboard Data:**
     - This aligns with the **Collection** tactic and the **T1056.001-Keylogging** technique.
   - **Step 3: Storing Data Encrypted in a Specific Folder:**
     - This aligns with the **Collection** tactic and the **T1074.001-Local Data Staging** technique, as the data is being collected and staged for potential exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (collecting system information, keylogging, and storing data) is consistent with the related TTPs.
   - The keylogger component collecting keystrokes and clipboard data before storing them encrypted in a specific folder is a plausible sequence of actions for the VERMIN malware.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
