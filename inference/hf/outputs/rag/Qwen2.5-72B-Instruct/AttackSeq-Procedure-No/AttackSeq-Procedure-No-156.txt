### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to exfiltrate collected data using the MIME protocol after using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control and transferring data using tools like Robocopy and PSCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH:**
     - This technique involves using SSH for lateral movement within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains for C2:**
     - APT10 often uses dynamic-DNS domains to maintain persistent and stealthy C2 communications.
   - **Data Transfer Tools (Robocopy and PSCP):**
     - Robocopy and PSCP are commonly used for file transfer and can be part of the exfiltration process.
   - **MIME Protocol for Exfiltration:**
     - The MIME protocol is typically used for encoding and transmitting data in email messages. It is not a common method for exfiltration over C2 channels, which usually involve more direct and stealthy methods.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - This technique suggests that data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communications, which in this case would likely be the dynamic-DNS domain and not the MIME protocol.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that APT10 is known to use dynamic-DNS domains for C2 and that the MIME protocol is not a typical method for exfiltration over C2 channels, the most plausible answer is that APT10 is not likely to use the MIME protocol for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
