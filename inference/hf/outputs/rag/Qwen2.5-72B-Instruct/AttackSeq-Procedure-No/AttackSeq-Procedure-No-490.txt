### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will use phishing emails containing malicious links to steal application access tokens, followed by collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access to a target system. The links often lead to malware or credential harvesting sites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FamousSparrow is known to use spearphishing emails with malicious links (T1566.002) to gain initial access to a target system. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Stealing Application Access Tokens:**
     - Once initial access is gained, it is common for attackers to steal application access tokens to maintain persistence and move laterally within the network. This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Discovery:**
     - After gaining access and potentially stealing tokens, the next logical step is to collect system information and probe files to understand the environment better. This is part of the Discovery phase (T1082, T1057, T1083, etc.).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the known behavior of FamousSparrow, it is likely that they will use phishing emails containing malicious links to steal application access tokens and then proceed to collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
