### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations only before performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access is gained by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
     - The APT will compromise trusted commercial network resources.
     - The APT will perform reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of victims' travel plans.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying files, directories, or registry keys to match the names or locations of legitimate system or application components.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using existing, legitimate user and service accounts to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.002-Business Relationships:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about business relationships, such as partnerships, supply chains, and other connections, to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that initial access is gained by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This aligns with the T1036.005 technique, which involves matching legitimate names or locations to evade detection.
   - **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources:**
     - The question mentions compromising trusted commercial network resources. This could involve using valid accounts (T1078) to gain access to these resources.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The question also mentions performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of victims' travel plans. This aligns with the T1591.002 technique, which involves gathering information about business relationships and potential targets.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Gain initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
     2. Compromise trusted commercial network resources.
     3. Perform reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of victims' travel plans.
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with the related TTPs. The APT would first gain access, then use that access to compromise trusted resources, and finally perform reconnaissance to gather more detailed information.
