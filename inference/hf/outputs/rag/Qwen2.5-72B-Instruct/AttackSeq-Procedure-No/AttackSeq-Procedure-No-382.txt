### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 is likely to use credential stuffing against the victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts after gaining initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access was gained through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
     - The question is about the likelihood of using credential stuffing to obtain valid accounts before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access to systems within a network.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems.
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for later use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT15 has already gained initial access using stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. This aligns with the T1078.002 and T1078 techniques.
   - **Credential Stuffing:**
     - Credential stuffing is a technique where attackers use automated scripts to test large numbers of username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This is typically used to gain initial access, not after initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Deployment of Tools:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT15 is likely to use tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution. This is a common next step in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that APT15 has already gained initial access through stolen credentials, it is unlikely that they would use credential stuffing to obtain valid accounts. Credential stuffing is more relevant for gaining initial access, not for further steps in the attack after initial access has been achieved.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that APT15 has already obtained valid accounts and is likely to proceed with the deployment of tools for further actions.

### Final Answer:
B: No
