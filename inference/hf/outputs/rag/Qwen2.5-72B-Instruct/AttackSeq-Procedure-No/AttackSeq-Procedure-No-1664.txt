### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether LightNeuron, after collecting and exfiltrating emails and local files, is likely to use FTP for Command and Control (C&C) communication instead of emails, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated collection and exfiltration of data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C&C.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):** LightNeuron is already using automated methods to collect and exfiltrate emails and local files. This aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **File Transfer Protocols for C&C (T1071.002):** The question asks if LightNeuron is likely to use FTP for C&C communication. FTP is a file transfer protocol, and T1071.002 specifically mentions using file transfer protocols for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003):** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C&C. While FTP is an unencrypted protocol, this technique is more about exfiltration rather than C&C.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - LightNeuron is already using automated methods to exfiltrate data (T1020).
   - The use of FTP for C&C communication (T1071.002) is a plausible next step, as it aligns with the need for a communication channel that can be used to control the malware.
   - While T1048.003 involves exfiltration over unencrypted protocols, it is not specifically about C&C communication, which is the focus of the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
