### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a banking Trojan, after searching for folders related to antivirus and banking software and collecting system information, is more likely to collect files from network shared drives or to capture screenshots and mouse clicks while the user browses banking sites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, system information, and other local data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves discovering information about the browser, such as installed plugins, history, and bookmarks.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots of the user's screen, which can be used to gather sensitive information, especially when the user is interacting with banking sites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collecting Files from Network Shared Drives:**
     - This would fall under the **Collection** tactic, but it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs. The closest related technique is T1005, which focuses on data from the local system, not network shared drives.
   - **Capturing Screenshots and Mouse Clicks:**
     - This is directly mentioned in the related TTPs as T1113-Screen Capture. This technique is particularly relevant for banking Trojans, as capturing screenshots and mouse clicks can provide direct access to sensitive information, such as login credentials and transaction details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the banking Trojan will capture screenshots and mouse clicks while the user browses banking sites rather than collecting files from network shared drives.

**Final Answer: B: No**
