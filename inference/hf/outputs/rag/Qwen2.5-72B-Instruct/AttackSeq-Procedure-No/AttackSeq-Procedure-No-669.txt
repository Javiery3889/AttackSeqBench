### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries, after identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase, would use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used by the adversary to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique involves discovering containers and resources on the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address. This is part of the Resource Development phase where they gather and prepare resources for their attack.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The question asks if they would then use DOCKERGEDDON to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
     - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique aligns with the idea of scanning netblocks to identify potential targets.
     - **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique aligns with the idea of discovering containers and resources, which could include Docker APIs.
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique is more relevant to the Command and Control phase, where adversaries try to hide their infrastructure to avoid detection. It is not directly relevant to the Reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The use of DOCKERGEDDON to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs fits well within the Reconnaissance phase, as it involves identifying potential targets and resources.
   - The related TTPs T1595.001 and T1613 support this sequence of actions.
