### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where CVE-2015-5119 is exploited to execute a first stage downloader. This downloader retrieves a second stage PlugX file, which then connects to several C2 domains starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will use steganography to hide its C2 communications with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves using steganography to hide C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography:** This technique involves using steganography to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from a C2 server to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Steganography in C2 Communications:**
     - The related TTPs T1001.002 and T1027.003 both involve the use of steganography, which is a technique used to hide data within other data. This can be used to evade detection and maintain stealth in C2 communications.
     - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of Sakula malware using steganography to hide its C2 communications with certain domains.
   - **Context of the Attack:**
     - The attack sequence described involves multiple stages, including the exploitation of a vulnerability, the use of a downloader, and the connection to C2 domains.
     - Given the sophistication of the attack, it is plausible that the attackers would use advanced techniques like steganography to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the attack, it is likely that the Sakula malware would use steganography to hide its C2 communications with the specified domains.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
