### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor Earth Lusca would use BITS jobs for defense evasion only after abusing elevation control mechanisms and employing obfuscation techniques during privilege escalation, following the use of tools like procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process for credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves using tools like procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process to extract user credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     1. **Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory):**
        - The threat actor uses procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process to obtain user credentials.
     2. **Privilege Escalation:**
        - After obtaining credentials, the threat actor might attempt to escalate privileges. This could involve abusing elevation control mechanisms and employing obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.
     3. **Defense Evasion:**
        - Once privileges are escalated, the threat actor might use BITS jobs to evade defenses. BITS jobs can be used to transfer files in the background, which can be a stealthy way to exfiltrate data or download additional malware.

   - **Likelihood of the Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question (BITS jobs only after abusing elevation control mechanisms and employing obfuscation techniques during privilege escalation) is plausible. However, it is not necessarily the only sequence. Threat actors often have multiple techniques and can adapt their methods based on the environment and their objectives.
     - The use of BITS jobs for defense evasion is a common technique, but it does not strictly require the prior steps of abusing elevation control mechanisms and employing obfuscation techniques during privilege escalation. These steps can be independent or occur in different orders.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the flexibility and adaptability of threat actors, it is not strictly necessary for Earth Lusca to follow the exact sequence described. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
