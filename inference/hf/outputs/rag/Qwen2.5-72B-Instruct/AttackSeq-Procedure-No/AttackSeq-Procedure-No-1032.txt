### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement after using tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1606.002-SAML Tokens:** This technique involves attackers using SAML tokens to gain access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternate authentication material (like SAML tokens) to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternate authentication material to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - After gathering Active Directory and network information, attackers often look for ways to move laterally within the network. SAML tokens, which are used for authentication, can be a valuable resource for this purpose.
     - The related TTPs indicate that SAML tokens can be used for credential access, defense evasion, and lateral movement. This aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that it is unlikely for attackers to use SAML tokens for lateral movement after the discovery phase. However, the related TTPs and the nature of SAML tokens make this less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, it is likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
