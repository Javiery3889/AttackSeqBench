### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a script named 'stopedge.bat' is used to delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means of defense evasion.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that persistence will be established using kernel modules, similar to techniques employed by Drovorub or Skidmap.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attacker's presence, which aligns with the described action of 'stopedge.bat' deleting 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions:**
     - This technique involves using kernel modules or extensions to maintain persistence. This is a method used by advanced malware like Drovorub and Skidmap to ensure that the malware remains active even after system reboots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the defense evasion step (file deletion), the attacker is likely to establish persistence using kernel modules.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is a plausible sequence. After evading detection by deleting files, the attacker would likely want to ensure that the malware remains on the system, which can be achieved by using kernel modules.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attacker is unlikely to establish persistence using kernel modules after the defense evasion step.
     - This is less plausible because it would be unusual for an attacker to perform defense evasion without also ensuring persistence, especially in advanced attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical attack, the most plausible answer is that the attacker will establish persistence using kernel modules after performing defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
