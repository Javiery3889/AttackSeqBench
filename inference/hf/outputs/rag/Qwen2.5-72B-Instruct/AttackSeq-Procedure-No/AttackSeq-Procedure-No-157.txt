### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to use shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement after gaining initial access through spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spear phishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This specific technique involves using spear phishing with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT10 is known to use spear phishing with malicious attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access to a target network. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - APT10 has been observed leveraging shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between different MSPs and their clients. This is a known tactic used by APT10 to expand their access and maintain persistence.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining access and moving laterally, APT10 typically conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network and identify valuable assets. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment and plan further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of APT10, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible. APT10 is likely to use spear phishing to gain initial access, leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement, and then conduct internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
