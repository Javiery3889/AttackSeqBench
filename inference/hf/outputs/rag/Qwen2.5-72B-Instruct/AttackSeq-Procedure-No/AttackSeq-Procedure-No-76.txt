### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malware, after gathering information about the infected computer (system and user names), will extract emails from archived Outlook .pst files and transmit the data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.003 - Email Account:**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering email account information, which can include usernames, email addresses, and other details.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting emails from local email clients, such as Outlook, which can include extracting emails from .pst files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed extract emails from .pst files and transmit them through encrypted emails to the attackers.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is capable of discovering email account information (T1087.003) and collecting emails from local email clients (T1114.001).
       - After gathering system and user names, it is plausible that the malware would proceed to collect emails from .pst files, as this is a common method for exfiltrating sensitive information.
       - Encrypting the emails before transmission is a common technique to avoid detection and ensure the data remains confidential during transit.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not extract emails from .pst files and transmit them through encrypted emails to the attackers.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice contradicts the related TTPs, which clearly indicate that the malware is capable of both discovering email account information and collecting emails from local email clients.
       - Given the context, it is less likely that the malware would gather system and user names but not proceed to collect and exfiltrate emails, which are valuable pieces of information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the malware will extract emails from .pst files and transmit them through encrypted emails to the attackers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
