### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 is likely to enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups during the Discovery phase after deploying a password dumper to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS during the Credential Access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries enumerating permission groups to understand the permissions and access levels of different users and groups within the system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves adversaries accessing credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to obtain user credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory):** APT28 has already deployed a password dumper (run.exe) to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS. This is a common technique used to gain access to user credentials.
   - **Discovery (T1069-Permission Groups Discovery):** After gaining access to credentials, it is logical for APT28 to enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups to understand the access levels and privileges of the obtained credentials. This information can help them move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, or identify high-value targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that APT28 has already obtained credentials through LSASS memory, it is highly likely that they would proceed to enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups to further their objectives. This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, which often perform thorough reconnaissance to maximize their access and control within a network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
