### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary would encrypt data with the 3DES algorithm and a hardcoded key prior to exfiltration after identifying privileged users during the discovery phase using the PsLogList tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This sub-technique involves using a custom method to archive data, which could include encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PsLogList Tool:** This tool is used to list event logs, which is part of the discovery phase to identify privileged users and their activities.
   - **Encryption with 3DES and a Hardcoded Key:** Encrypting data with a hardcoded key is a method to protect data during exfiltration, but it is not a common or recommended practice due to security risks. Hardcoding a key can make the encryption vulnerable to reverse engineering and key recovery.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique is about compressing or archiving data, which is a common step before exfiltration to reduce the size and make the data easier to transfer.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This sub-technique suggests that the adversary might use a custom method to archive data, which could include encryption, but it does not specify the use of 3DES with a hardcoded key.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is possible that an adversary might use encryption as part of their data exfiltration process, using 3DES with a hardcoded key is not a typical or secure method. More secure and common methods include using strong encryption algorithms with dynamically generated keys or other secure key management practices.
   - The related TTPs do not specifically mention 3DES or hardcoded keys, and the use of such a method would be unusual and risky for the adversary.

### Final Answer:
B: No
