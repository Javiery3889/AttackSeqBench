### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer is likely to communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using ports that are not commonly used for the protocol they are communicating with. For example, using port 6999 for UDP or port 55556 for TCP, which are not standard ports for common protocols.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the type of communication they are performing. For example, using a raw socket or a custom protocol instead of HTTP, HTTPS, or other standard application-layer protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will use non-standard ports for C2 communication before stealing information and encrypting it.
     - The related TTP T1571 (Non-Standard Port) directly supports the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
     - The sequence described in the question (C2 communication, followed by information theft and encryption) is a common attack pattern.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will not use non-standard ports for C2 communication.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1571, which specifically mentions the use of non-standard ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP T1571 (Non-Standard Port) and the common attack pattern described in the question, the most plausible answer is that WinDealer will use non-standard ports for C2 communication before stealing information and encrypting it.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
