### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that Seaduke might take after communicating with the C&C server. The actions include retrieving detailed bot/system information, updating configurations, uploading/downloading files, securely deleting itself, archiving sensitive information, and exfiltrating data via legitimate cloud services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data from the compromised system to the attacker's C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Seaduke will indeed perform the actions described in the question.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This aligns with the step of archiving sensitive information.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This aligns with the step of exfiltrating data via legitimate cloud services.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Seaduke will not perform the actions described in the question.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as the TTPs clearly indicate that archiving and exfiltration are part of the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
