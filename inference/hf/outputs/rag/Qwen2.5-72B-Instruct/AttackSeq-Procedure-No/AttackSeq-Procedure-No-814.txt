### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer is likely to prompt the user for their credentials after discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration and encrypting it with AES.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to extract credentials.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files:** This technique involves stealing credentials from files on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If WinDealer were to prompt the user for their credentials, it would align with the T1589.001 technique, which involves collecting credentials during reconnaissance. However, this technique typically involves passive collection rather than active prompting.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - The related TTPs suggest that WinDealer is more likely to use techniques like network sniffing (T1040) and stealing credentials from files (T1552.001) rather than actively prompting the user. These techniques are more stealthy and less likely to alert the user to the presence of malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the nature of the techniques involved, it is more plausible that WinDealer would use passive methods to collect credentials rather than actively prompting the user.

**Final Answer: B: No**
