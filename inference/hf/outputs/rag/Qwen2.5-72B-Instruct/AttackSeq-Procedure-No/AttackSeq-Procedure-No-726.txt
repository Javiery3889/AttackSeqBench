### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Stuxnet, after exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement, is likely to use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication to send system information and receive commands or updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network. The MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities are examples of such exploits.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for C2 communication. This can include sending system information and receiving commands or updates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Lateral Movement:**
     - Stuxnet is known to use the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement. This aligns with the T1210 technique.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The question specifically asks about the use of FTP for C2 communication. The T1071.002 technique mentions the use of file transfer protocols for C2, which includes FTP.
   - **Stuxnet's Known C2 Methods:**
     - Stuxnet is known to use a variety of C2 methods, including HTTP and HTTPS, but not typically FTP. Stuxnet's primary C2 mechanisms involve more sophisticated and less detectable methods to avoid detection and maintain stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that Stuxnet is known to use more sophisticated C2 methods and not typically FTP, the most plausible answer is that it is unlikely to use FTP for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
