### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where the adversary sends emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server (VPS):** This technique involves the adversary using VPSs to host infrastructure, which can include C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server (VPS):** This technique is similar to T1583.003 and involves the adversary using VPSs to host infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves the adversary using spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001):** The adversary uses spearphishing emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT to gain initial access. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Resource Development (T1583.003 and T1584.003):** After gaining initial access, it is common for adversaries to develop additional infrastructure to support their operations. Using VPSs to host C2 servers is a typical next step.
   - **Compromised Webservers:** While the question mentions using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts, this is not directly related to the VPS techniques listed. However, it is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as adversaries often use a combination of VPSs and compromised webservers to host their infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common sequence of actions in cyber attacks, it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s. This aligns with the resource development techniques T1583.003 and T1584.003.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
