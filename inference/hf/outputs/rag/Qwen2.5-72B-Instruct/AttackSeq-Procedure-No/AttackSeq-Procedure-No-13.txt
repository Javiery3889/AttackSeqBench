### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT42 is likely to conduct internal reconnaissance (accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information) only after moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts, following the initial spear-phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using internal spear-phishing to move laterally within a network. It suggests that the attacker uses social engineering to trick internal users into providing access or credentials.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves the development of resources, specifically email accounts, which can be used for various purposes, including initial access and lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Spear-Phishing:**
     - APT42 sends spear-phishing emails to additional targets, leveraging the victimâ€™s trusted relationships. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT42 is likely to use the compromised personal email accounts to move laterally within the network. This aligns with the T1534-Internal Spearphishing technique.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - Once lateral movement is achieved, APT42 would likely conduct internal reconnaissance to gather more information about the network and systems. This includes accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question (spear-phishing, lateral movement, internal reconnaissance) is a logical and common attack pattern. It aligns with the related TTPs and the typical behavior of APT groups.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs and typical APT behavior.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
