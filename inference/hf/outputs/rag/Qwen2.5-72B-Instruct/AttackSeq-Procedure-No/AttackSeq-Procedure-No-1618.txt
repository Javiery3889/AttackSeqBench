### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin, after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase, is likely to set auto-forward rules on the victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up rules to automatically forward emails to an attacker-controlled account.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question mentions that Regin has already gathered information on processes and memory utilization and scanned for deleted files. These activities align with the Discovery tactic, which is aimed at understanding the environment and identifying potential targets.
   - **Network Sniffing (T1040):**
     - Network sniffing is a technique used to capture and analyze network traffic. This can be part of the Discovery phase to understand the network topology and identify valuable data.
   - **Email Forwarding Rule (T1114.003):**
     - Setting up email forwarding rules is a technique used in the Collection tactic to gather specific types of data, such as emails. This is a logical next step after the initial discovery phase, as the attacker would want to collect and exfiltrate valuable information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that Regin has already performed discovery activities and network sniffing, it is plausible that the next step would be to set up email forwarding rules to monitor and collect network traffic, especially emails, which can contain sensitive information.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
