### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an attack group would send spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files to gain a foothold into victim networks after attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious files or websites.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The question mentions that the attack group has already attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gather information and potential credentials.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - After gathering credentials, the next logical step is to use those credentials to gain initial access to the victim's network. One common method is to send spearphishing emails.
   - **Spearphishing Techniques:**
     - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique aligns with the question's description of sending emails with hyperlinks to malicious files.
     - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, which is another common method but not specifically mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question specifically mentions sending spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files, which aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique.
   - Given that the attack group has already gathered credentials, it is logical to use these credentials to craft more targeted and convincing spearphishing emails to gain initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
