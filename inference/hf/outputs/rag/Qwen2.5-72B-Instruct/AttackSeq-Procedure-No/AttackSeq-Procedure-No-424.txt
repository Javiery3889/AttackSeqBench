### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware, following initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, such as Word documents, to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - The question states that initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Execution of COM Object:**
     - Once the malicious Word document is opened, it can execute a COM (Component Object Model) object. COM objects are often used in malware to perform various tasks, including gathering system information.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - Malware often gathers system information to determine the environment and to tailor its actions. This is a common post-exploitation technique.
   - **Downloading Payloads:**
     - After gathering system information, malware may download additional payloads. Ursnif and GandCrab are known to be distributed in this manner. Ursnif is a banking trojan, and GandCrab is a ransomware variant.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access through a phishing email with a malicious Word document, the malware can use a COM object to gather system information and then download additional payloads, such as Ursnif and GandCrab.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
