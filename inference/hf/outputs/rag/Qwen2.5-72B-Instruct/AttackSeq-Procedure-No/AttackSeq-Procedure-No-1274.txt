### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers researched software code (as part of the Reconnaissance phase) to enable supply-chain operations before using the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592.002-Software:** This technique involves adversaries researching and collecting information about software, which can be used to identify vulnerabilities or to understand the software's architecture and dependencies. This is a common step in the Reconnaissance phase to enable supply-chain attacks.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves adversaries using JavaScript to execute malicious code. This is often used in web-based attacks to deliver payloads, such as in the case of the SocGholish framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did research software code to enable supply-chain operations before using the SocGholish framework.
     - The related TTP T1592.002-Software supports the idea that attackers would research software to understand its vulnerabilities and dependencies, which is a crucial step in enabling supply-chain attacks.
     - The T1059.007-JavaScript TTP aligns with the use of the SocGholish framework to deliver malicious JavaScript, which is a common method for compromising legitimate websites and delivering payloads.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not research software code to enable supply-chain operations before using the SocGholish framework.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1592.002-Software, which indicates that researching software is a common step in the Reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is more plausible that the attackers did research software code to enable supply-chain operations before using the SocGholish framework to deliver malicious JavaScript.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
