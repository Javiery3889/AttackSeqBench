### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication during the command and control (C2) phase only after exfiltrating data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which can include web shells and JSP tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567):**
     - This technique is specifically mentioned in the question, indicating that FIN13 is using web shells and JSP tools to exfiltrate data over web services.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - This technique suggests that the exfiltration is happening over the same channel used for C2 communications. This implies that the C2 channel is already established and being used for exfiltration.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question states that the exfiltration over web services has already occurred.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that FIN13 would transfer tools and encode data for C2 communication only after this exfiltration step.
     - Given that the C2 channel is already established and being used for exfiltration (T1041), it is less likely that FIN13 would wait until after the exfiltration to transfer tools and encode data for C2 communication. Typically, the C2 channel and the necessary tools would be set up before or during the exfiltration process to ensure continuous control and data transfer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is less likely that FIN13 would transfer tools and encode data for C2 communication only after the exfiltration step. The C2 channel and tools are typically established and used concurrently with exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
