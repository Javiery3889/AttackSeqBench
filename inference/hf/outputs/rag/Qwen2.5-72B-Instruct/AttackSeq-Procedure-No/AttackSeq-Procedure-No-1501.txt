### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Anunak malware will leverage Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation during lateral movement after connecting to backends using backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to tunnel command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate domain accounts to gain higher-level privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backconnect SSL and DNS Tunneling (T1572):** The question mentions that Anunak uses backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities. This aligns with the T1572 technique.
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1068 and T1078.002):** The question also mentions privilege escalation, which aligns with the T1068 and T1078.002 techniques.
   - **Metasploit for Port Scanning, System Reconnaissance, and Privilege Escalation:** The question specifically asks if Anunak will leverage Metasploit for these activities. Metasploit is a well-known tool used for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation. However, the related TTPs do not explicitly mention Metasploit.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the related TTPs confirm that Anunak uses backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for C2 and performs privilege escalation, they do not specifically mention the use of Metasploit. However, given that Metasploit is a common tool for these activities and the question is asking about a plausible sequence, it is reasonable to assume that Anunak could leverage Metasploit for these tasks.
