### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that RIG EK (Exploit Kit) will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic after using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using a proxy server to route network traffic through an intermediary server to hide the true destination or source of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting:**
     - This sub-technique involves using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic by making it appear as if the traffic is destined for a different, benign domain. This is often used to bypass network filters and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using domain fronting after setting up proxy servers would be a logical step to further obfuscate the command and control (C2) communications. Domain fronting can make it appear as if the traffic is going to a legitimate, trusted domain, which can help evade detection by network security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that RIG EK would not use domain fronting. However, given the context of using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, it would be less likely that RIG EK would stop at just using proxies without employing additional obfuscation techniques like domain fronting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of obfuscation techniques, it is more plausible that RIG EK would use domain fronting to further disguise its C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
