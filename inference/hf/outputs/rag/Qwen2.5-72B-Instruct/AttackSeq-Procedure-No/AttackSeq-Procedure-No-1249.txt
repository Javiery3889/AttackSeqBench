### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after BlueBravo employs defense evasion techniques (DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling), their malware will attempt encrypted HTTPS communication with its C2 server before gathering system information like username and computer name.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system files or directories to avoid detection.
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves smuggling malicious code or data within HTML content to bypass security controls.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery (Discovery):** This technique involves identifying the system's owner or user, which can be useful for further actions like privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques (T1036.005 and T1027.006):** These techniques are used to avoid detection and ensure the malware can operate undetected. They are typically employed early in the attack sequence to establish a foothold.
   - **Encrypted HTTPS Communication with C2 Server:** This is a common next step after initial evasion techniques. The malware needs to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. Encrypted communication (HTTPS) is used to avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **System Information Gathering (T1033):** This is a discovery technique that is often performed after the malware has established communication with the C2 server. The malware needs to gather information about the system to determine the next steps in the attack, such as identifying the user and system name.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that after employing defense evasion techniques, the malware is likely to establish a secure communication channel with its C2 server before gathering system information. This is because:
     - **Initial Evasion:** The malware needs to avoid detection to operate.
     - **C2 Communication:** Establishing a secure C2 channel is crucial for receiving further instructions and maintaining control.
     - **System Information Gathering:** Once the C2 communication is established, the malware can then gather system information to tailor its actions.
