### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
     - Initial Access is achieved through malicious documents.
     - Macros are enabled, leading to file execution in randomly named directories.
     - The question asks if it is likely that campaigns disable driver signing verification by tampering with Registry keys before loading a rootkit driver as part of Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1553.006 - Code Signing Policy Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying the code signing policy to allow unsigned or improperly signed code to run.
   - **T1553.002 - Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using valid code signing certificates to sign malicious code.
   - **T1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools:**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying security tools to prevent detection or analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1553.006 - Code Signing Policy Modification:**
     - This technique is directly related to disabling driver signing verification by tampering with Registry keys. It is a common method used to load unsigned drivers, which is a key step in deploying rootkits.
   - **T1553.002 - Code Signing:**
     - While this technique involves using valid certificates, it is not directly related to disabling driver signing verification. It is more about making the malicious code appear legitimate.
   - **T1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools:**
     - This technique is about disabling security tools, which is a broader category and not specifically about driver signing verification.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the question is T1553.006 - Code Signing Policy Modification. This technique directly involves tampering with Registry keys to disable driver signing verification, which is a crucial step in loading a rootkit driver.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
