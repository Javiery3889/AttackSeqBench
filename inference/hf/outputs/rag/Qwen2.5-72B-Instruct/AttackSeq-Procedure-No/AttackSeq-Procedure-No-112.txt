### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers are likely to taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data.
     - **Tainting Shared Content:** This is a technique used to manipulate shared resources to facilitate lateral movement.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Moving from one system to another within a network.
     - **Persistence:** Ensuring continued access to a system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:**
     - This technique involves modifying shared resources (e.g., files, scripts) to include malicious content, which can then be used to compromise other systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1080-Taint Shared Content:**
     - This technique is often used to spread malware or malicious scripts across a network. By tainting shared content, attackers can ensure that when other users or systems access these resources, they become compromised.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique is used to move tools or files to a remote system to facilitate further actions, such as executing commands or deploying additional malware.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Discovery Phase:** Attackers gather information about the network.
     - **Tainting Shared Content (T1080):** Attackers modify shared resources to include malicious content.
     - **Lateral Movement (T1570):** Attackers use the tainted content to move to other systems.
     - **Persistence:** Once on new systems, attackers may install additional persistence mechanisms to maintain access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that attackers would taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
