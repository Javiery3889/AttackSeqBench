### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to use compromised Managed Service Provider (MSP) credentials to gain higher-level permissions, such as domain administrator, after deploying tools like mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping via DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to escalate privileges within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1078.002-Domain Accounts):** APT10 often uses valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network. This can include compromised credentials from MSPs, which are often trusted and have elevated privileges.
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1078.002-Domain Accounts):** Once initial access is gained, APT10 can use the same domain accounts to escalate privileges. This is particularly relevant if the compromised credentials are from an MSP, as these accounts often have higher-level permissions, including domain administrator rights.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - APT10 is known for its sophisticated and methodical approach to cyber attacks. They often leverage compromised credentials to gain initial access and then use these credentials to escalate privileges.
   - Given that the question mentions the use of tools like mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping, it is highly likely that APT10 would use the compromised credentials (such as those from an MSP) to gain higher-level permissions, including domain administrator rights.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, as both initial access and privilege escalation can be achieved using valid domain accounts.
