### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sunburst backdoor, which was delivered through a supply-chain attack, would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the backdoor uses web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with its C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This indicates that the initial access was achieved through a supply-chain attack, specifically by compromising the SolarWinds software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1195.002):** The Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack, which means the initial access was achieved by compromising the SolarWinds software and distributing it to victims.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001):** Once the initial access is achieved, the backdoor would need to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Sunburst backdoor is designed to communicate with its C2 server after the initial access is achieved. The backdoor is embedded in the compromised software and is activated when the software is installed and run on the victim's system.
   - The communication with the C2 server is a post-compromise activity, not a pre-compromise activity. The backdoor cannot communicate with the C2 server before it is installed and activated on the victim's system.

### Final Answer:
B: No
