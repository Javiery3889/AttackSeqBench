### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Exploiting a VBScript engine vulnerability to gain initial access through a watering hole attack.
     2. Disabling security tools by modifying EDR-related services to prevent auto-start on system reboot.
     3. Downloading and executing a backdoor for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors, which aligns with the initial access through a watering hole attack.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools:**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying security tools, which aligns with the step of disabling EDR-related services to prevent auto-start on system reboot.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through a watering hole attack, which is a common method for drive-by compromises. This aligns with the related TTP.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools):**
     - The question mentions disabling security tools by modifying EDR-related services to prevent auto-start on system reboot. This is a common defense evasion technique to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Further Operations:**
     - The question mentions downloading and executing a backdoor for further operations, which is a logical next step after gaining initial access and evading defenses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers would attempt to disable security tools by modifying EDR-related services to disable auto-start on system reboot before downloading and executing a backdoor for further operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
