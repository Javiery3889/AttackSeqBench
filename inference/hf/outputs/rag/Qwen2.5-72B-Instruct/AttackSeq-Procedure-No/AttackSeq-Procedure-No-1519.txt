### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool to initiate a multi-stage infection chain only after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents employing the remote template technique, and after creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents employing the remote template technique. This is a common initial access method used by attackers to deliver malware.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - The question then mentions exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool. This is a specific exploitation technique that can be used to deliver a payload.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question states that a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' is created to maintain persistence. This aligns with the related TTP T1053.005-Scheduled Task, which is a common technique for maintaining persistence.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question is:
       1. Gain initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
       2. Exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool.
       3. Create a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence is plausible because it follows a logical progression of an attack:
       - Initial access is gained through a common method (spear-phishing).
       - The exploit (Equation Editor) is used to deliver a payload.
       - Persistence is established using a scheduled task.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
