### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Trickbot, after targeting applications like Filezilla and Microsoft Outlook to steal credentials and information, is likely to check the total number of running processes to evade detection and avoid execution in virtual or sandbox environments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves the adversary checking the system for signs of a virtual or sandbox environment.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique is also about checking the system for signs of a virtual or sandbox environment, but it is specifically aimed at evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Trickbot is known for its sophisticated capabilities, including evasion techniques. Checking the total number of running processes is a common method to detect virtual or sandbox environments, which are often used by security researchers to analyze malware.
     - The related TTPs (T1497.001-System Checks) indicate that this is a plausible step in the attack sequence. The technique is used both for discovery and defense evasion, which aligns with Trickbot's behavior.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Trickbot would not perform such checks. However, given Trickbot's known evasion techniques and the related TTPs, this choice is less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and Trickbot's known behavior, it is likely that Trickbot would check the total number of running processes to evade detection and avoid execution in virtual or sandbox environments.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
