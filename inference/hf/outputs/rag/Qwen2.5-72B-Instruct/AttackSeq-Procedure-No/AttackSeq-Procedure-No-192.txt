### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor DRAGONFISH:
     - Achieving persistence using the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
     - Injecting hidden DLLs into the Internet Explorer process.
     - The question then asks if DRAGONFISH is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections and query Active Directory for computers to gather directory information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves an adversary discovering systems on a network to identify potential targets for lateral movement or other actions.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves an adversary querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - Using the Run Registry key (T1060) is a common method for achieving persistence, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Injecting Hidden DLLs:**
     - Injecting hidden DLLs into the Internet Explorer process (T1055) is a technique used to execute code in the context of another process, often for the purpose of evading detection or performing additional actions.
   - **Remote System Discovery:**
     - The related TTP T1018 (Remote System Discovery) directly aligns with the question's query about remotely discovering systems over LAN connections.
   - **Querying Active Directory:**
     - While T1012 (Query Registry) is mentioned, it is more about gathering information from the local system. However, querying Active Directory for computers to gather directory information is a common next step after discovering remote systems, which is part of the broader Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that DRAGONFISH would proceed to remotely discover systems over LAN connections and query Active Directory for computers to gather directory information. This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors who use a combination of persistence, process injection, and discovery techniques to move laterally within a network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
