### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a PDF attachment is sent, passes through security filters, and appears benign. The attack then abuses the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and elevate privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves methods to bypass UAC, which is a security feature in Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to the system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves abusing mechanisms that are designed to control elevation of privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique is listed under the Defense Evasion tactic, indicating that it is used to evade detection and maintain persistence by bypassing UAC.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The question describes a scenario where a PDF attachment is used to initiate the attack. This is a common method for delivering malware, often through phishing emails.
     - The PDF passes through security filters and appears benign, which suggests that the malware is well-crafted to avoid detection.
     - The attack then abuses the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC and elevate privileges. This aligns with the T1548.002 and T1548 techniques, which are specifically about bypassing UAC and abusing elevation control mechanisms.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the described sequence of events is not likely. However, the related TTPs and the common use of PDFs in phishing attacks make this sequence plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question. The attack uses a PDF to bypass initial security filters and then abuses the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC and elevate privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
