### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 (a known threat actor) is likely to use geographically distributed scan bots to probe potential victims' identity information only after discovering the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems with bots that report back to a central server.
   - The sequence of actions described includes:
     1. Using crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
     2. Scanning IP ranges to discover the environment.
     3. Identifying vulnerable systems.
     4. Using geographically distributed scan bots to probe identity information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:**
     - This technique involves collecting credentials through various means, which can be part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments (like Word and Excel documents) to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 is known to use spear phishing with attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access to a target network. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT28 would likely perform reconnaissance to understand the environment. This can include scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems (T1589.001).
   - **Geographically Distributed Scan Bots:**
     - The use of geographically distributed scan bots to probe identity information is a more advanced and specific technique. While APT28 is known for sophisticated operations, the question implies a very specific sequence of actions that may not be typical for their operations.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question is quite detailed and specific. While APT28 might use some of these techniques, the exact sequence of using geographically distributed scan bots only after discovering the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems is not a commonly documented or typical behavior for APT28.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible for APT28. While they use spear phishing and reconnaissance, the specific sequence involving geographically distributed scan bots is not a typical or well-documented behavior for this group.

**Final Answer: B: No**
