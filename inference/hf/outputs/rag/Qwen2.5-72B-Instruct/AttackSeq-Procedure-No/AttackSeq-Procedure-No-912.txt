### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Gamaredon group is likely to collect files from various information repositories after using backdoors to list interesting files (such as Office documents) and then automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data to a remote system, typically a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the use of automated tools to gather data from various sources on the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering file and directory paths on the system to identify potential targets for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon is likely to collect files from various information repositories and then automatically upload them to the C&C server.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** Gamaredon uses backdoors to list interesting files, which aligns with discovering file and directory paths.
       - **T1119-Automated Collection:** After discovering the files, Gamaredon would use automated tools to collect these files from various repositories.
       - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** Finally, the collected files would be automatically uploaded to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon is not likely to collect files from various information repositories and automatically upload them to the C&C server.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate a sequence of discovery, collection, and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that Gamaredon is likely to collect files from various information repositories and then automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
