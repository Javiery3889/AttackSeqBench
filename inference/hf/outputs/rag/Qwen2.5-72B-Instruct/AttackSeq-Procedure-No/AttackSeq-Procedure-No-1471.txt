### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT after establishing a Command and Control (C2) connection through a malicious VBA script.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C2 through Malicious VBA Script:**
     - The initial step involves executing a malicious VBA script, which is likely to establish a C2 connection. This aligns with the **T1204.002-Malicious File** and **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange** techniques.
   - **Phishing Campaign to Deliver BlackEnergy 3 RAT:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will then perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT. The **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** technique is relevant here, as it describes a method for delivering malicious payloads via email attachments.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Step 1:** The adversaries use a malicious VBA script to establish a C2 connection. This is a common initial step in many attacks.
     - **Step 2:** After establishing the C2 connection, the adversaries might use the C2 channel to further compromise the network or to deliver additional payloads.
     - **Step 3:** Delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT via a phishing campaign is a plausible next step. The **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** technique supports this, as it is a common method for delivering RATs and other malware.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack, it is plausible that the adversaries would perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT after establishing a C2 connection through a malicious VBA script.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
