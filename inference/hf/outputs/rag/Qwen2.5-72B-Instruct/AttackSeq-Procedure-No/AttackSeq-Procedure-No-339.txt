### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Nemesis bootkit, after evading detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads, will achieve persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR) only afterward.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
     - This technique involves loading malicious code before the operating system (OS) starts, which can help in evading detection and achieving persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - A bootkit is a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a hard drive or other bootable media, allowing it to load before the OS and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique is specifically about using a bootkit to achieve persistence by infecting the boot sector.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the bootkit will infect the VBR only after it has evaded detection and executed before the OS fully loads.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the bootkit will not infect the VBR only afterward but rather as part of its initial infection process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that a bootkit like Nemesis is designed to load before the OS and achieve persistence by infecting the boot sector (which includes the VBR). The evasion and persistence are part of the same initial infection process.
   - The question implies a sequence where the bootkit first evades detection and then infects the VBR. However, in the context of bootkits, the infection of the VBR is typically part of the initial infection process, not a separate step that occurs afterward.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
