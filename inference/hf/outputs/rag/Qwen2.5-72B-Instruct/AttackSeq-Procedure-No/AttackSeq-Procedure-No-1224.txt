### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000, after evading detection, is likely to use LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to gather NetNTLM credentials before exfiltrating data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves an attacker responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS queries to redirect traffic and capture NetNTLM credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique is also listed under the Collection tactic, indicating that it can be used to gather information, such as credentials, for further use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evasion:**
     - The question mentions that T9000 has already evaded detection by customizing its installation. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences to avoid being detected by security products and researchers.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay are techniques used to gather NetNTLM credentials. This aligns with the Credential Access tactic, which is a logical next step after evading detection.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The question also mentions exfiltrating data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic. This is a common final step in many attack sequences, where the attacker sends the collected data back to their command and control server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (evading detection, gathering credentials, and exfiltrating data) is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs.
   - The related TTPs confirm that LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay are used for both Credential Access and Collection, which fits well into the described attack sequence.
