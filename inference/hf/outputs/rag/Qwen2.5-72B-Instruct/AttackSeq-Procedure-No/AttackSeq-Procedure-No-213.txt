### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Milestone backdoor, including ensuring persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
   - It then asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) only after performing system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system files or directories to avoid detection.
   - **T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification:** This technique involves altering the code signing policies to allow the execution of unsigned or malicious code.
   - **T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to change system behavior, such as creating or modifying registry keys to ensure persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Registry Modification (T1112):** The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry. This aligns with the T1112 technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036.005 and T1553.006):** The question asks about the deployment of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using DKOM. The related TTPs include T1036.005 (Match Legitimate Name or Location) and T1553.006 (Code Signing Policy Modification), which are both techniques used for Defense Evasion but do not specifically mention DKOM.
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:** The question specifies that these functionalities must be performed before deploying the Fire Chili kernel rootkit. However, the related TTPs do not mention these specific actions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs focus on persistence and defense evasion techniques but do not provide specific information about system information discovery or screen capture functionalities.
   - The question implies a specific sequence of actions that is not fully supported by the provided TTPs.
   - Given the lack of specific TTPs related to system information discovery and screen capture, it is less likely that Deep Panda would deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit only after performing these actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
