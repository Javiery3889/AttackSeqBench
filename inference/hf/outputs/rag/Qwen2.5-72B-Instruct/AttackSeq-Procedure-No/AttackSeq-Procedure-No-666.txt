### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will display network connections using the `netstat` command before moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket `atexec`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, often using tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of using stolen credentials for authentication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory):** The threat actors use Mimikatz to dump credentials from LSASS memory.
     2. **Credential Access (T1550.002-Pass the Hash):** The threat actors use Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash to gain access to other systems.
     3. **Lateral Movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash):** The threat actors use the stolen credentials to move laterally.
     4. **Lateral Movement (AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec):** The threat actors use webshells and `atexec` to execute commands on remote systems.

   - **Network Connections (netstat):**
     - Displaying network connections using `netstat` is a common reconnaissance step to understand the network environment and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
     - However, it is not a necessary step in the sequence of TTPs described. The threat actors can move laterally without explicitly displaying network connections.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the typical flow of an attack, it is not necessary for the threat actors to display network connections using `netstat` before moving laterally. The sequence of actions described (dumping credentials, pass-the-hash, and lateral movement) can be performed without this step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
