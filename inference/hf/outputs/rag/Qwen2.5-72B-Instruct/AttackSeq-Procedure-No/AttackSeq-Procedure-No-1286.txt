### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla operators are likely to set auto-forward rules on victims' email accounts to collect data before updating command and control (C2) servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems.
   - The key points are:
     - Establishing a hidden foothold.
     - Searching other computers and storing stolen information.
     - Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts.
     - Updating C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting emails from the local email client on the victim's machine.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:**
     - This technique involves setting up rules to automatically forward emails to an attacker-controlled email account.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing a Hidden Foothold:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where the attacker gains and maintains access to the victim's network.
   - **Searching Other Computers and Storing Stolen Information:**
     - Once the foothold is established, attackers often search for valuable data and store it for exfiltration.
   - **Setting Auto-Forward Rules on Email Accounts:**
     - The related TTP T1114.003 (Email Forwarding Rule) directly supports this step. By setting up auto-forward rules, attackers can continuously collect emails without needing to maintain a constant presence on the victim's machine.
   - **Updating C2 Servers:**
     - Maintaining control of infected systems often involves updating C2 servers to ensure the attacker can continue to communicate with the compromised network.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. Turla operators are known for their sophisticated and persistent attack methods, which include setting up auto-forward rules to collect data and maintaining control through C2 servers.
   - The related TTPs T1114.001 and T1114.003 provide strong evidence that setting up auto-forward rules is a plausible and likely step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
