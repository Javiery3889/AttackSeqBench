### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after establishing communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols (like DNS and HTTP) to tunnel C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different, unencrypted protocol that is not used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS, which are different protocols from DNS and HTTP used for C2.
     - However, the related TTPs suggest that exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) is a common and efficient method for adversaries to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the SombRAT backdoor is unlikely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS, which are different protocols from DNS and HTTP used for C2.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is more likely that the SombRAT backdoor would use the same C2 channel (DNS and HTTP) for exfiltration to maintain stealth and efficiency.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practice of using the same C2 channel for exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that the SombRAT backdoor is unlikely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

**Final Answer: B: No**
