### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the email accounts collected from Microsoft Outlook MAPI will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data from local email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, by accessing the MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface).
   - **T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves creating or modifying email forwarding rules to automatically forward emails to an attacker-controlled email address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:** This technique focuses on collecting email data from the local client. It does not inherently involve exfiltration over FTP.
   - **T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up forwarding rules to send emails to an attacker-controlled address. It does not specify the use of FTP for exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about exfiltration over FTP. Neither of the related TTPs (T1114.001 and T1114.003) mention FTP as a method of exfiltration.
   - T1114.001 is about collecting email data locally, and T1114.003 is about forwarding emails to an attacker-controlled email address. Neither of these techniques inherently involve FTP exfiltration.
   - Therefore, based on the provided TTPs, the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

### Final Answer: B: No
