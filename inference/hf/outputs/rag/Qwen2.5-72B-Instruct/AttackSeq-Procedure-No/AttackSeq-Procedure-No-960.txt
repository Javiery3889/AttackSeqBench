### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus Group is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections after using tools like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance, and before escalating privileges by creating local administrator accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries using tools like `ipconfig.exe` to gather information about the network configuration of the system they have compromised.
   - **T1018 - Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries using tools to discover other systems on the network, which can be done after gathering network configuration information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance (T1016):** The use of `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` aligns with the System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016) technique. This is the first step in understanding the network environment.
   - **Remote System Discovery (T1018):** After gathering network configuration information, the next logical step is to discover other systems on the network. This is consistent with the Remote System Discovery (T1018) technique.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creating local administrator accounts is a form of privilege escalation, which typically occurs after the adversary has a good understanding of the network and has identified potential targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, the Lazarus Group is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections after using tools like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance and before escalating privileges by creating local administrator accounts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
