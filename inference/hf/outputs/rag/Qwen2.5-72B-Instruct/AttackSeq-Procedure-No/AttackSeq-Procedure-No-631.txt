### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether INOCNATION malware is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control (C2) communications only before employing defense evasion techniques like XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for C2 communications, which can include SSL/TLS.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that INOCNATION uses encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications only before employing defense evasion techniques.
     - This is unlikely because the use of SSL/TLS for C2 communications is a common technique used to evade network-based detection, and it is often used in conjunction with other defense evasion techniques, not before them.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that INOCNATION does not use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications only before employing defense evasion techniques.
     - This is more plausible because malware typically employs multiple defense evasion techniques simultaneously or in a sequence that is not strictly linear. The use of SSL/TLS for C2 communications is often part of the overall evasion strategy, not a separate phase before other techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that INOCNATION does not use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications only before employing defense evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: B: No**
