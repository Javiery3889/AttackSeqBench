### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document, dropping an HTA file, executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading, and checking for installed antivirus software using WMI.
   - The key point is whether the WMI check for installed antivirus software occurs only after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and leverages webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, CVE-2017-11882 in an RTF document) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves using WMI to discover security software installed on the system.
   - **T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using WMI for various purposes, including discovery and execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The RTF document exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop an HTA file.
   - **Execution of FinalBot with DLL Sideloading:** The HTA file is executed, and the FinalBot backdoor is loaded using DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:** The HTA file communicates with the C2 server using webserv-redir.net.
   - **Security Software Discovery (T1518.001):** The WMI check for installed antivirus software.

   The question asks if the WMI check for installed antivirus software (T1518.001) occurs only after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server. 

   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The exploitation and dropping of the HTA file (T1203) happen first.
     - The HTA file is executed, and the FinalBot backdoor is loaded (DLL sideloading).
     - The HTA file communicates with the C2 server (webserv-redir.net).
     - The WMI check for installed antivirus software can occur at any point, but the question specifies it should happen only after the C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and the related TTPs, the WMI check for installed antivirus software (T1518.001) does not necessarily have to occur only after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server. It can happen at any point in the attack sequence, but the question specifically asks if it happens only after the C2 communication.

   Therefore, the correct answer is:

   **Final Answer: B: No**
