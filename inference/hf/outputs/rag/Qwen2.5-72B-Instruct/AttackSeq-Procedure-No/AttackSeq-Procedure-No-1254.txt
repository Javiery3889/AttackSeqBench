### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlueBravo will perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.
   - The specific checks mentioned are identifying strings like "Virtual," "vmware," or "VirtualBox."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1497.001 - System Checks**
   - This technique involves adversaries checking for the presence of virtualized environments, which can help them avoid analysis or detection by security researchers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that BlueBravo will perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.
     - This aligns with the related TTP T1497.001, which specifically mentions checking for virtualized environments.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that BlueBravo will not perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.
     - This does not align with the related TTP T1497.001, which indicates that such checks are a common technique used by adversaries.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP T1497.001, it is likely that BlueBravo will perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
