### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the attacker using various methods to identify remote systems on a network. The `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView is a specific tool that can be used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves the attacker compromising legitimate websites to deliver malicious content to victims when they visit the site. The SocGholish framework is a tool that can be used for this purpose.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** This is typically the first step in an attack where the attacker gains an initial foothold in the victim's environment. The SocGholish framework is used to deliver the initial payload via a compromised website.
     - **Discovery (T1018-Remote System Discovery):** Once the attacker has gained initial access, they will often perform reconnaissance to understand the network and identify other systems of interest. The `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView is a tool that can be used for this purpose.

   - **Logical Order:**
     - It is logical for the attacker to first gain initial access to the victim's system before performing any discovery activities. The discovery phase typically follows the initial access phase to gather information about the compromised environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of events in a typical attack, it is unlikely that the attackers will use the `Get-NetComputer` command for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.

**Final Answer: B: No**
