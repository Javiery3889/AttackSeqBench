### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server after establishing contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using protocols that are not the primary C2 protocol.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This sub-technique specifically involves using unencrypted protocols (like FTP or SMTP) that are not the primary C2 protocol for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that attackers will use FTP or SMTP protocols for exfiltration.
     - The related TTPs (T1048 and T1048.003) support this by indicating that attackers can use alternative and unencrypted protocols for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that attackers will use FTP or SMTP protocols for exfiltration.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that using alternative and unencrypted protocols is a known technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is likely that attackers will use FTP or SMTP protocols for exfiltration as part of their attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
