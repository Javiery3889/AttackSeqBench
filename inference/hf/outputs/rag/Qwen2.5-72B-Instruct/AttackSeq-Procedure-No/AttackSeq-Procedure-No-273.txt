### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant collects system information (uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate) only after establishing persistence by creating a scheduled task or registry entry to run the executable from a hidden system directory.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
     - Establishing persistence.
     - Collecting system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using a custom TCP-based protocol for communication with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Korplug variant collects system information only after establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Korplug variant does not necessarily collect system information only after establishing persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Korplug variant uses a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communication and can create a scheduled task for persistence.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of actions: whether system information is collected only after establishing persistence.
   - In many malware variants, the collection of system information often occurs early in the infection process to gather initial data about the compromised system. This data can be used to determine the next steps, such as whether to establish persistence or to exfiltrate data.
   - Establishing persistence (e.g., creating a scheduled task) is typically a subsequent step after initial reconnaissance and data collection.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the Korplug variant collects system information before or during the initial stages of the infection, rather than only after establishing persistence.

### Final Answer: B: No
