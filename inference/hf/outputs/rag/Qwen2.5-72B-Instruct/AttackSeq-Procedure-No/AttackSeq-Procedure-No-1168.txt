### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM actors, after conducting reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains, are likely to have collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring or registering domains to support operations.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:** This technique involves determining the physical locations of targets.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique involves searching open websites and domains to gather information about targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:** This technique aligns with the idea of collecting location information.
       - **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase of identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did not collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
     - The related TTPs do not support this:
       - **T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:** This technique is specifically about collecting location information, which contradicts this choice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of the attack, it is more plausible that ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
