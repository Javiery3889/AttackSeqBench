### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM actors identified network topologies before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
   - The key points to consider are the sequence of actions: developing a custom toolset, registering domains, and then gaining initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise (Watering Hole Attacks):** This technique involves compromising a website that the target is likely to visit, to deliver malware or other malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves registering domains to use in various stages of an attack, such as for hosting malicious content or for command and control (C2) infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content to gain initial access to a target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Developing Custom Toolset and Registering Domains:**
     - These actions are part of the resource development phase, where the attackers prepare the necessary tools and infrastructure for their campaign.
   - **Identifying Network Topologies:**
     - Identifying network topologies is typically a reconnaissance activity that occurs after gaining initial access to a network. It involves mapping the network to understand its structure and identify potential targets.
   - **Gaining Initial Access:**
     - The related TTPs (T1189 and T1566.002) indicate that the initial access is gained through drive-by compromises (watering hole attacks) and spear-phishing emails with links.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The logical sequence would be: 
       1. Develop custom toolset.
       2. Register domains.
       3. Gain initial access through spear-phishing emails or watering hole attacks.
       4. Identify network topologies after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is unlikely that ProjectM actors identified network topologies before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

**Final Answer: B: No**
