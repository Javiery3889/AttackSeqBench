### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Yellow Garuda will maintain persistence by configuring a Systemd service with the `WantedBy=multi-user.target` configuration after using macro-enabled template files for initial access via phishing and remote template injection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1137.001-Office Template Macros:** This technique involves using macro-enabled templates to execute malicious code when a document is opened.
   - **T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into templates that are used by applications, such as Microsoft Word, to execute code when the template is loaded.
   - **T1543.002-Systemd Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying Systemd service files to achieve persistence on Linux systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through macro-enabled template files and remote template injection. This aligns with the T1137.001 and T1221 techniques.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question asks if Yellow Garuda will maintain persistence by configuring a Systemd service with the `WantedBy=multi-user.target` configuration.
     - The T1543.002 technique describes creating or modifying Systemd service files to achieve persistence, which is relevant to the question.
   - **Context:**
     - The question specifies that the persistence method involves configuring a Systemd service, which is a Linux-specific technique.
     - The initial access methods (macro-enabled templates and template injection) are typically used on Windows systems, but the persistence method (Systemd service) is used on Linux systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question implies a transition from a Windows-based initial access method to a Linux-based persistence method. This is plausible if the attacker has moved from a Windows environment to a Linux environment.
   - However, the question does not provide explicit information about such a transition, and the persistence method (Systemd service) is specific to Linux.

### Final Answer
Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**

The initial access methods (macro-enabled templates and template injection) are typically used on Windows systems, and the persistence method (Systemd service) is specific to Linux systems. Without explicit information about a transition to a Linux environment, it is less likely that Yellow Garuda would use a Systemd service for persistence in this scenario.
