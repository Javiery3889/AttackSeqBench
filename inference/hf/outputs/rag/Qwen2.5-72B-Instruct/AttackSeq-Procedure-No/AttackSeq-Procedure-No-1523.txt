### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a loader that collects a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the loader will gather detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information via WMI queries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - T1082-System Information Discovery involves adversaries collecting information about the system and its configuration, which can include the hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The loader is already collecting a wide range of data, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
   - The specific information mentioned in the question (hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information) is a subset of the broader data collection described.
   - WMI queries are a common method used to gather this type of detailed system information, which is consistent with the T1082 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the loader is already collecting a wide range of data and the specific information mentioned is a subset of the broader data collection, it is highly likely that the loader will gather detailed information about the victim's computer via WMI queries.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
