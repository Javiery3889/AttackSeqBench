### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the NewPass implant is likely to initiate a download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
   - The key points are:
     - The implant uses a loader library to decode the configuration file and evade detection.
     - The question is about the sequence of actions: download via FTP and then exfiltration using encrypted POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can include encrypted POST requests.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the loader library decoding the configuration file.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted, non-C2 protocol, which could include FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Loader Library and Decoding:**
     - The use of a loader library to decode the configuration file is a defense evasion technique (T1140).
   - **FTP Download:**
     - The question mentions initiating a download via FTP. FTP is an unencrypted protocol, which aligns with T1048.003 (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol). However, this technique is specifically about exfiltration, not downloading.
   - **Exfiltration Using Encrypted POST Requests:**
     - Exfiltration over a C2 channel using encrypted POST requests aligns with T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to initiate a download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware is more likely to focus on exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041) rather than using FTP for downloading.
   - FTP is typically used for exfiltration over an unencrypted protocol (T1048.003), not for downloading.

### Final Answer:
Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a malware attack, it is less likely that the NewPass implant will initiate a download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests. The focus is more on exfiltration over a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: No**
