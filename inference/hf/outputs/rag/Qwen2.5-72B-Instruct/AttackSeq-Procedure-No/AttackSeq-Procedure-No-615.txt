### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Hidden Cobra group would target financial organizations with spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents only after executing the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Flash) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with attachments (e.g., Microsoft Word documents) that contain malicious content to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Step 1: Hosting Bankshot Implants:**
       - Hidden Cobra uses domains impersonating cryptocurrency platforms to host Bankshot implants.
     - **Step 2: Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
       - The Bankshot implant is executed through a Flash exploit.
     - **Step 3: Spear Phishing with Malicious Attachments (T1566.001):**
       - After the Bankshot implant is executed, the group targets financial organizations with spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
       - **Initial Compromise:**
         - The use of a Flash exploit to execute the Bankshot implant is a common method for initial access and execution.
       - **Follow-Up Attack:**
         - Once the initial compromise is successful, it is common for attackers to use additional methods to maintain persistence and expand their foothold. Spear phishing with malicious attachments is a common follow-up technique to gain additional access or to spread the infection to other systems within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible. Therefore, the answer is:

   **Final Answer: A: Yes**
