### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the collected email accounts will be exfiltrated to a specific domain (dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net) before being sent through a POST web request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email accounts and messages from email clients.
   - **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection:** This sub-technique involves collecting email from remote email servers.
   - **T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This sub-technique involves collecting email from local email clients.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions the exfiltration of collected email accounts to a domain (dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net) before sending them through a POST web request.
   - The related TTPs focus on the collection of email accounts but do not provide information about the exfiltration process or the specific domain used for exfiltration.
   - The TTPs do not specify any particular method of exfiltration or the use of a specific domain for exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs only cover the collection of email accounts and do not provide details about the exfiltration process or the use of a specific domain.
   - The question asks about a specific exfiltration method that is not covered by the provided TTPs.
   - Therefore, based on the information given, it is not accurate to say that the collected email accounts will be exfiltrated to the domain dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net before being sent through a POST web request.
