### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether threat actors, after bypassing AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions, will use AtomBombing to leverage Windows operating system mechanisms for malicious code injection and execute it via legitimate programs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools:** This technique involves disabling or modifying security tools to prevent them from functioning correctly, which aligns with the initial part of the question about bypassing AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.
   - **T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process, which is a common method for executing malicious code in a way that evades detection. AtomBombing is a specific type of process injection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that threat actors will use AtomBombing after bypassing the security solutions.
     - AtomBombing is a sophisticated method of process injection that leverages the Windows API to execute code in the context of a legitimate process, which aligns with the T1055-Process Injection technique.
     - Given that the threat actors have already bypassed the security solutions (T1562.001), it is plausible that they would use a sophisticated method like AtomBombing to further evade detection and execute their malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that threat actors will not use AtomBombing after bypassing the security solutions.
     - While it is possible that threat actors might use other methods, the related TTPs (T1055-Process Injection) indicate that process injection is a common and effective technique for executing malicious code in a stealthy manner.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of using AtomBombing for process injection after bypassing security solutions, the most plausible answer is:
   - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
