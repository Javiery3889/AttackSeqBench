### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to steal data from the victim's clipboard after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery, and before compressing collected files and sending them to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering the network configuration of the victim's system, which includes information like the local IP address.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting data from the local system, which can include various types of data such as files, credentials, and other sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1016):**
     - The backdoor has already obtained the local IP address and system time, which aligns with the discovery phase.
   - **Collection (T1005):**
     - The backdoor is collecting data from the local system, which is a common step in the collection phase. However, the question specifically asks about stealing data from the clipboard.
   - **Clipboard Data Collection:**
     - The related TTPs do not explicitly mention clipboard data collection (T1115-Input Capture: Clipboard Data). This suggests that while the backdoor is collecting data, it is not specifically mentioned that it is stealing clipboard data.
   - **Compression and Exfiltration:**
     - The question mentions compressing collected files and sending them to the C&C server, which is a common step in the exfiltration phase. However, the related TTPs do not provide specific information about this step.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs do not provide evidence that the backdoor specifically steals data from the clipboard. The backdoor is performing discovery and collection, but the clipboard data collection is not explicitly mentioned.

### Final Answer:
B: No
