### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SparrowDoor (likely a malware or tool used by the threat actor FamousSparrow) is likely to exfiltrate files to their C&C server before reading file contents from the compromised systems after the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as usernames, computer names, and file attributes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system's owner and user information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves reading data from the local system, such as file contents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The related TTPs T1082 and T1033 are part of the Discovery phase, where the malware collects system information and user details.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The related TTP T1005 is part of the Collection phase, where the malware reads data from the local system, such as file contents.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The question specifically asks about the sequence of exfiltration (sending files to the C&C server) and reading file contents.
     - Typically, in a logical attack sequence, an attacker would first read the file contents (T1005) to determine what data is valuable before exfiltrating it to the C&C server. Exfiltration is usually the final step in the Collection phase, after the data has been identified and read.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical attack flow, it is more plausible that FamousSparrow would read file contents from the compromised systems before exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
