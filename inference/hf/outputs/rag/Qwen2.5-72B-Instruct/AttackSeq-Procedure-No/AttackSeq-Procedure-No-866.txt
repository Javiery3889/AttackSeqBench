### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group's malware is likely to stage archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server before preparing the staged data for exfiltration by creating a file containing paths of all files to be exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration.
   - **T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Local Data Staging (T1074.001):** This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system. This means the data is stored on the victim's local machine before it is exfiltrated.
   - **Remote Data Staging (T1074.002):** This technique involves collecting and staging data on a remote system. This means the data is transferred to a remote server (in this case, the OWA server) before it is exfiltrated.

   - The question specifically mentions staging data on a target's OWA server, which aligns with the **Remote Data Staging (T1074.002)** technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question describes a scenario where data is staged on a remote OWA server, which aligns with the **Remote Data Staging (T1074.002)** technique, the most plausible answer is:

   **Final Answer: A: Yes**
