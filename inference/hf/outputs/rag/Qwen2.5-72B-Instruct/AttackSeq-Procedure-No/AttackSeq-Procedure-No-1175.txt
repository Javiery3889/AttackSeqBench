### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Taidoor malware.
   - It starts with spear-phishing emails (Reconnaissance) and then asks if it is likely that the malware will use beaconing communications (HTTP GET requests) before exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop itself onto the target's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing (T1566.001):** The question starts with spear-phishing emails, which aligns with the related TTPs.
   - **Beaconing Communications:** The question mentions that the malware will use beaconing communications (HTTP GET requests) before exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - **Exploiting a Vulnerability in Microsoft Office:** The question then states that the malware will exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop itself onto the target's system.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Initial Access (Spear-Phishing):** The spear-phishing email is used to deliver the malware, which is a common initial access technique.
   - **Beaconing Communications:** After gaining initial access, malware often establishes a communication channel with the command and control (C2) server. This is typically done through beaconing, which can use HTTP GET requests.
   - **Exploiting a Vulnerability in Microsoft Office:** Once the malware is on the system, it may exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to further its presence or to drop additional payloads.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access through spear-phishing, the malware can establish beaconing communications to maintain control and then exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop itself onto the system.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
