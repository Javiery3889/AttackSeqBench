### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that WinDealer will maintain persistence through the registry's RUN key only after using an IP generation algorithm for Command and Control (C2).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):** This technique involves using an algorithm to generate a large number of domain names that the malware can use to communicate with its C2 server. This is a common method to evade detection and ensure reliable communication.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a registry key or a file to the startup folder to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DGA (T1568.002):** This technique is used for C2 communication and is typically employed to maintain a connection with the C2 server. It does not inherently involve persistence mechanisms.
   - **Registry Run Keys (T1547.001):** This technique is used to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts, which is a form of persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of DGA for C2 communication is a separate and distinct step from maintaining persistence. While DGA helps the malware communicate with the C2 server, it does not automatically imply that the malware will use the registry's RUN key for persistence.
   - Persistence through the registry's RUN key is a specific technique that the malware must explicitly implement. It is not a byproduct of using DGA for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that WinDealer will maintain persistence through the registry's RUN key only after using DGA for C2 communication. The two techniques serve different purposes and are not inherently linked in such a way that one automatically follows the other.

### Final Answer: B: No
