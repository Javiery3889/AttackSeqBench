### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Charming Kitten is likely to develop phishing sites only after gaining initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.
   - The sequence of events described involves reconnaissance, spear-phishing, and then the development of phishing sites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using spear-phishing to gather information, often through services like email or SMS.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which can be used for further attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1598.001 and T1598):** These techniques are used to gather information, which is a crucial first step in any attack. Charming Kitten would likely use spear-phishing and phishing to gather sensitive information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication.
   - **Initial Access (T1566):** After gathering the necessary information, Charming Kitten would use phishing to gain initial access to the target system. This is a logical next step after reconnaissance.
   - **Developing Phishing Sites:** The question suggests that Charming Kitten would develop phishing sites only after gaining initial access. However, developing phishing sites is often a preparatory step that can be done before or during the reconnaissance phase to facilitate the initial access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While it is possible that Charming Kitten might develop phishing sites after gaining initial access, it is more likely that they would develop these sites as part of their reconnaissance and initial access efforts. Phishing sites are often used to facilitate the initial access by providing a platform to deliver the phishing content.
   - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance, initial access, then developing phishing sites) is less common and less efficient compared to the more typical sequence of developing phishing sites as part of the reconnaissance and initial access phases.

### Final Answer:
B: No
