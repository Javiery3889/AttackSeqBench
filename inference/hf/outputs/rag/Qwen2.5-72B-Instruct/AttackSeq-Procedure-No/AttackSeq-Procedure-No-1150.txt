### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Raccoon stealer is likely to have embedded a base64-encoded payload within a LNK file to bypass blocking and ensure Defense Evasion before communicating with C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.
   - Key points:
     - Collection of system and account information, including crypto wallet data.
     - Execution phase.
     - Defense Evasion using a base64-encoded payload in a LNK file.
     - Communication with C&C servers using Telegram features.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves using encoded or encrypted files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Base64 Encoding (T1027.013):**
     - Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode data to make it appear less suspicious and to bypass security measures. This aligns with the idea of embedding a payload within a LNK file to evade detection.
   - **Deobfuscation (T1140):**
     - Once the encoded payload is delivered, it needs to be deobfuscated or decoded to execute the malicious code. This is a logical next step after the payload is delivered.
   - **LNK File:**
     - LNK files (shortcuts) are often used to execute malicious payloads because they can be crafted to look benign and can be used to trigger the execution of the encoded payload.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Using Telegram features for C&C communication is a known technique to maintain stealth and avoid detection by traditional network monitoring tools.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Raccoon stealer is known to use sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. Embedding a base64-encoded payload within a LNK file and using Telegram for C&C communication are consistent with the tactics of advanced malware.
