### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the Tuyul malware might use after exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 for initial access.
     - Leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
     - Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. In this case, the vulnerability is CVE-2017-9841 in PHPUnit.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate credentials to maintain access to a system. This can include logging into external remote services.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:**
     - This technique involves using cron jobs to maintain persistence by scheduling tasks to run at regular intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 (T1190):**
     - This is the initial step in the sequence, which is clearly described in the question.
   - **Leveraging legitimate credentials (T1078):**
     - The question mentions that the malware will use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. This aligns with the T1078 technique.
   - **Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' (T1053.003):**
     - The question states that the malware will periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence. This aligns with the T1053.003 technique, which involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs. The malware exploits a vulnerability to gain initial access, uses legitimate credentials to log into external services, and sets up a cron job to maintain persistence by periodically downloading a script.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
