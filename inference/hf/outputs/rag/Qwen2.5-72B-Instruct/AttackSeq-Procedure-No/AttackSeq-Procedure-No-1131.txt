### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CVE-2015-5119 is exploited to execute a first stage downloader.
   - The malware then connects to several C2 domains, starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will communicate with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` only before retrieving the second stage PlugX file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the malware. The initial C2 domain is used to establish a foothold, and subsequent C2 domains are used for further stages of the attack.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the transfer of additional tools or malware to the compromised system. In this context, it refers to the retrieval of the second stage PlugX file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This suggests that the malware will use multiple C2 domains in a sequence. The initial C2 domain (`cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`) is likely used to establish the initial connection and download the first stage of the malware.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This indicates that the second stage of the malware (PlugX) will be downloaded from a different C2 domain after the initial connection is established.
   - Given the multi-stage nature of the attack, it is unlikely that the malware will communicate with only `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` before retrieving the second stage PlugX file. The initial C2 domain (`cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`) is likely to be used for the initial communication, and subsequent C2 domains will be used for the second stage.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the multi-stage nature of the attack and the related TTPs, it is unlikely that the Sakula malware will communicate with only `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` before retrieving the second stage PlugX file.

**Final Answer: B: No**
