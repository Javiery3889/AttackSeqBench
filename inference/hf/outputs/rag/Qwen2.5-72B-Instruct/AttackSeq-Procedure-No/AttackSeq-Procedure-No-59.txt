### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro is likely to collect information about the victim's computer (operating system details and installed security products) only before employing techniques to evade detection and emulation.
   - The key points are:
     - Collection of information about the victim's computer.
     - Use of techniques to evade detection and emulation.
     - The sequence of these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:**
     - This technique involves the attacker checking for virtualization or sandbox environments to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001 - System Checks:**
     - This sub-technique involves the attacker performing system checks to determine if the environment is a virtual machine or sandbox.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection of Information:**
     - The question mentions collecting information about the victim's computer, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - The question also mentions using techniques to evade detection and emulation, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The question asks if the collection of information happens only before the evasion techniques.
     - The related TTPs suggest that the evasion techniques (T1497 and T1497.001) are part of the initial checks to determine if the environment is safe for the malware to operate.
     - It is common for malware to perform these checks early in the infection process to avoid detection and to gather necessary information about the environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer before employing evasion techniques. However, the question specifically asks if this collection happens **only** before the evasion techniques, which is not necessarily the case. Malware often performs multiple checks and collects information throughout the infection process, not just at the beginning.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
