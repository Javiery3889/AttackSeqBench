### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in an attack:
     - Leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
     - Executing shellcode to make memory executable.
     - Bypassing EAF (Enhanced Address Space Layout Randomization) mitigation.
     - Bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) protections.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to bypass security mechanisms, such as ASLR and DEP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access:**
     - This is part of the initial exploitation phase, where the attacker uses a vulnerability in Flash to gain control over the memory.
   - **Executing shellcode to make memory executable:**
     - This is also part of the exploitation phase, where the attacker executes shellcode to manipulate memory and make it executable.
   - **Bypassing EAF:**
     - EAF is a mitigation technique that randomizes the address space to make it harder for an attacker to predict memory locations. Bypassing EAF is a step in defense evasion.
   - **Bypassing ASLR and DEP:**
     - ASLR and DEP are also defense mechanisms. ASLR randomizes the memory layout, and DEP prevents the execution of code in certain memory regions. Bypassing these is also part of defense evasion.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The initial steps (exploiting Flash and executing shellcode) are necessary to gain control over the memory and execute arbitrary code.
     - Bypassing EAF, ASLR, and DEP are subsequent steps to ensure that the exploit can run successfully despite these defenses.
     - Typically, an attacker would first bypass EAF to gain a foothold in the memory space before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP, as EAF is a more fundamental mitigation that affects the initial memory access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the typical order of operations in an exploit, it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
