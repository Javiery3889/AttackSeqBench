### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sayad malware will collect keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media only after gathering system information, open ports, and browser data during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the system, such as system information, open ports, and browser data. This is often done to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The collection phase involves gathering specific data, such as keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media. This phase is usually executed after the discovery phase to ensure that the malware has a clear understanding of what data to collect and how to collect it.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The exfiltration phase involves sending the collected data to a remote server. The data is often encrypted and compressed (T1560) to make the exfiltration process more efficient and less detectable.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a sequence where the malware first gathers system information, open ports, and browser data (discovery phase) and then collects keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media (collection phase).
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with the typical attack lifecycle. The discovery phase helps the malware understand the environment, and the collection phase follows to gather specific data.
   - The related TTPs (T1560 and T1005) support this sequence, as T1005 involves collecting data from the local system, which is a part of the collection phase.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
