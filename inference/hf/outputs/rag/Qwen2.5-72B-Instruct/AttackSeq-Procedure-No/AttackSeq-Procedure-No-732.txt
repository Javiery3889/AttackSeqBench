### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities performed by the Pierogi backdoor.
   - First, it conducts discovery activities to collect system information.
   - Then, it establishes a multi-stage channel by connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy before communicating with a second C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the backdoor collecting system information such as computer name, username, and operating system version.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves the use of multiple stages of communication, often involving a proxy or relay server, to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor is likely to establish a multi-stage channel by first connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy before communicating with a second C2 server.
     - This aligns with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique, which describes the use of multiple stages of communication, including the use of proxies.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor is not likely to establish a multi-stage channel by first connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy before communicating with a second C2 server.
     - This does not align with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique, which is relevant to the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of activities described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor is likely to establish a multi-stage channel by first connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy before communicating with a second C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
