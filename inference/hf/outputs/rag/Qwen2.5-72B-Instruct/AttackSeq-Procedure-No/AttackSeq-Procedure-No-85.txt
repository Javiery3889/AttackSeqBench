### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor will collect files from the computer only after obtaining system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and the local IP address, after compressing files with zlib for transmission to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, documents, and other data of interest to the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information such as the computer name, OS version, architecture, and IP address. This information is often used to understand the environment and tailor the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will collect files only after obtaining system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will collect files without necessarily obtaining system information first.

   - **Reasoning:**
     - The T1082 technique (System Information Discovery) is typically performed early in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the target system. This information is crucial for the attacker to understand the environment and plan subsequent actions.
     - The T1005 technique (Data from Local System) involves collecting files and data from the local system, which is a later step in the attack lifecycle.
     - Given that the question mentions compressing files with zlib for transmission to the C&C server, it is logical that the backdoor would first gather system information to understand the environment before collecting and compressing files for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor will collect files only after obtaining system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
