### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CozyDuke, after being executed by a dropper using `rundll32.exe` and performing tasks like establishing persistence, is likely to disable MFA for a specified user using the `AADInternals Set-AADIntUserMFA` command before communicating with its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique involves modifying or disabling MFA to maintain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using `rundll32.exe` to execute code, often for the purpose of evading defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution and Persistence:**
     - The question states that CozyDuke is executed by a dropper using `rundll32.exe`, which aligns with the T1218.011 technique.
     - CozyDuke then performs tasks such as establishing persistence, which could involve creating a scheduled task (T1053.005).

   - **Disabling MFA:**
     - The question asks if CozyDuke is likely to disable MFA using the `AADInternals Set-AADIntUserMFA` command.
     - The T1556.006 technique involves modifying or disabling MFA, which is relevant to the question.

   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The question mentions that CozyDuke communicates with its C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter. This is a common behavior for malware to exfiltrate data and receive commands.

4. **Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is plausible that after establishing persistence, CozyDuke would attempt to disable MFA to maintain access and reduce the risk of detection or account lockout.
     - Disabling MFA would be a logical step to ensure continued access to the compromised system and to facilitate further malicious activities.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is reasonable to conclude that CozyDuke would disable MFA before communicating with its C&C server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
