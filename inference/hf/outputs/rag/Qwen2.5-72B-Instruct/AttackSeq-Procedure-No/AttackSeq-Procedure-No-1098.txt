### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke, after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection, is likely to compress output data using a custom implementation of the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm before exfiltrating the data via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves using built-in or third-party libraries to compress data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves using custom code to compress data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke does use a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm to compress the data.
     - The related TTP T1560.003 (Archive via Custom Method) supports the idea that the malware uses a custom method for compression.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke does not use a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm to compress the data.
     - The related TTP T1560.002 (Archive via Library) suggests that the malware might use a built-in or third-party library for compression, which contradicts the use of a custom method.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm.
   - The related TTP T1560.003 (Archive via Custom Method) aligns with the use of a custom method for compression.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke does use a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm to compress the data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
