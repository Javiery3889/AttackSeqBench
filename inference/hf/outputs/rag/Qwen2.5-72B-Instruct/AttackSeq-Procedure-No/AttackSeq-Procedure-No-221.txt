### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Shellbot, after establishing C&C communication via an IRC channel, is likely to gather information about the infected host, including details like the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the adversary is likely to gather information about the system to understand its environment better. This can include details such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the TTP T1082-System Information Discovery. After establishing C&C communication, it is common for malware like Shellbot to gather detailed information about the infected host to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the TTP T1082-System Information Discovery. It suggests that Shellbot would not gather such information, which is less likely given the typical behavior of malware in the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the typical behavior of malware in the discovery phase, the most plausible answer is that Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
