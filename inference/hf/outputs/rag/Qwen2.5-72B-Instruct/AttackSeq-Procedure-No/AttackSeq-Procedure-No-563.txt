### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors used T1057 Process Discovery to gain knowledge about the systems and internal networks only after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol, following the use of T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a remote system for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls to evade defenses, such as modifying security software configurations or exploiting trusted relationships.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically using DNS for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:** This is typically used early in the attack to gain initial access or to evade detection. It helps the threat actors maintain persistence and avoid being detected by security measures.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol:** This is used for command and control (C2) communication. After gaining initial access and evading defenses, threat actors often set up C2 channels to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system. It is typically used to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Step 1: T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:** The threat actors subvert trust controls to evade defenses and gain initial access.
   - **Step 2: T1071 Application Layer Protocol:** After gaining access, they set up command and control communication using standard application layer protocols.
   - **Step 3: T1057 Process Discovery:** Once the C2 channel is established, the threat actors can then use process discovery to gather information about the systems and internal networks.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (T1553 -> T1071 -> T1057) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks. Threat actors typically need to establish a C2 channel before they can perform detailed reconnaissance and process discovery.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
