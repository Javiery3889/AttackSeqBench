### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the PowerLess Backdoor is likely to use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access after capturing user credentials and performing OS credential dumping.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1219-Remote Access Software:** This technique involves the use of legitimate remote access software to maintain persistence and command and control (C2) over the victim's environment.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which can be used to gain further access or move laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor will use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The T1219 technique (Remote Access Software) aligns with the use of legitimate utilities for maintaining remote access.
       - After capturing credentials and performing OS credential dumping, it is common for attackers to use these credentials to establish persistent access using legitimate tools to avoid detection.
       - AnyDesk and PuTTy are legitimate utilities that can be used to establish remote connections, making them suitable for maintaining C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor will not use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While it is possible that the attacker might use other methods, the use of legitimate utilities is a common and effective technique for maintaining C2.
       - The related TTPs (T1219 and T1003) support the use of legitimate tools for remote access and credential dumping, respectively.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in cyber attacks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerLess Backdoor will use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
