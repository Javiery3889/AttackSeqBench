### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will query the registry for installed applications as part of software discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system, including installed applications.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding entries to the registry run keys to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):** The malware has already achieved persistence by adding Intel-related files to the registry run keys.
   - **Defense Evasion (Impersonating Symantec Executable):** The malware is impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery (T1012-Query Registry):** After achieving persistence and evading defenses, it is common for malware to gather more information about the system to understand its environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware has already achieved persistence and evaded defenses, it is highly likely that the next step in the attack sequence would be to gather more information about the system. Querying the registry for installed applications (T1012-Query Registry) is a common technique used for software discovery and can help the malware identify additional targets or vulnerabilities to exploit.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
