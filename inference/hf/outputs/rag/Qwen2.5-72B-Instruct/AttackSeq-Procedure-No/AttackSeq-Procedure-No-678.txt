### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use Process Doppelgänging to inject into a target process while escalating privileges on the underlying host after gaining persistence by creating new user accounts with RSA keys for backdoor access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging:** This is a specific type of process injection where the attacker creates a new process in a suspended state, replaces its memory with the target process's memory, and then resumes it, effectively making the new process appear as the target process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging:** This technique is also used for defense evasion, where the attacker uses Process Doppelgänging to evade detection by security software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Creating New User Accounts with RSA Keys for Backdoor Access:**
     - This is a method of gaining persistence, where the attacker creates new user accounts with RSA keys to maintain access to the system.
   - **Process Doppelgänging:**
     - This technique is used for both privilege escalation and defense evasion. It involves injecting code into a process to execute arbitrary code and to evade detection.
   - **Escalating Privileges:**
     - After gaining persistence, attackers often attempt to escalate privileges to gain higher-level access to the system.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:**
     - After gaining persistence, it is common for attackers to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system.
   - **Process Doppelgänging for Privilege Escalation:**
     - Process Doppelgänging is a sophisticated technique that can be used to escalate privileges by injecting code into a higher-privileged process.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Process Doppelgänging is also used for defense evasion, which is a common goal for attackers to avoid detection by security software.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that Process Doppelgänging is a technique used for both privilege escalation and defense evasion, it is plausible that attackers would use this technique after gaining persistence to further their attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
