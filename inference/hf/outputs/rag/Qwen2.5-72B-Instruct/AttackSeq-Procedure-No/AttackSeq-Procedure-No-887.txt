### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor is likely to perform high-level collection tasks (like file searching or metadata gathering) before gathering information from the victim's machine, including usernames, as part of its system reconnaissance activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is used to establish persistence by adding a reference to the malware in the 'Run' registry key or the 'Startup' folder.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This is the same technique as above, reinforcing the method of persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves the backdoor searching for files and directories on the victim's machine, which is a form of high-level collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will perform high-level collection tasks before gathering information from the victim's machine.
     - The related TTP T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) supports this, as it involves searching for files and directories, which is a form of high-level collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will not perform high-level collection tasks before gathering information from the victim's machine.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1083, which indicates that file and directory discovery is a common step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, particularly T1083 (File and Directory Discovery), it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor will perform high-level collection tasks before gathering information from the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
