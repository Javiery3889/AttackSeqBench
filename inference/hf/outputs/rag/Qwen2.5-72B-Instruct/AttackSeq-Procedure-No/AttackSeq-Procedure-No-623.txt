### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the CostaRicto Campaign is likely to use tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning after employing PowerShell injection techniques via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module, and before using the SombRAT backdoor for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries using tools to discover network services and open ports on remote hosts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves adversaries injecting code into legitimate processes to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Injection (T1055-Process Injection):** The question mentions the use of PowerShell injection techniques via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module. This aligns with the T1055 technique, which is used for defense evasion.
   - **Network Service Scanning (T1046-Network Service Discovery):** The question asks if tools like pscan and nmap are used for network service scanning. This aligns with the T1046 technique, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **SombRAT Backdoor:** The SombRAT backdoor is used for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, which are all part of the Discovery tactic.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Initial Step: PowerShell Injection (T1055-Process Injection):** The campaign starts with using PowerShell injection to execute the payload.
   - **Intermediate Step: Network Service Scanning (T1046-Network Service Discovery):** After gaining initial access and executing the payload, it is logical for the attackers to perform network service scanning to understand the network environment.
   - **Final Step: SombRAT Backdoor (Discovery TTPs):** Once the network is mapped, the SombRAT backdoor is used to perform further discovery activities like process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.

### Final Answer
Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, the most plausible sequence is that the CostaRicto Campaign would use tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning after employing PowerShell injection techniques and before using the SombRAT backdoor for further discovery.

Final Answer: A: Yes
