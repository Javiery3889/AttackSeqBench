### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ShadowPad is likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER, specifically by setting the `WantedBy=multi-user.target` configuration.
   - This configuration ensures that the service (GOGETTER) runs when the system begins accepting user logins.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.002-Systemd Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying Systemd service files to achieve persistence. Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.002-Systemd Service:**
     - This technique involves using Systemd services to escalate privileges, often by ensuring that a service runs with higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ShadowPad is likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that ShadowPad would use Systemd to ensure that GOGETTER runs when the system begins accepting user logins. The `WantedBy=multi-user.target` configuration is a common way to achieve this.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ShadowPad is not likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER.
     - This choice is less plausible given the related TTPs, which indicate that Systemd services are a common method for achieving persistence and privilege escalation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of Systemd for persistence, the most plausible answer is that ShadowPad is likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
