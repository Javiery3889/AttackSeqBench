### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware after monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.
   - The key points are:
     - Monitoring running processes (Discovery tactic, T1057-Process Discovery).
     - Engaging in double-extortion ransomware (Impact tactic, T1657-Financial Theft).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries monitoring running processes to understand the system's environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:**
     - This technique involves adversaries stealing financial data or funds, which is a form of financial impact.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that after discovering running processes, SUNSPOT is likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them.
     - However, the related TTPs do not directly support this sequence. T1657-Financial Theft is more about stealing financial data or funds, not necessarily exfiltrating and encrypting files.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that after discovering running processes, SUNSPOT is not likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware.
     - This aligns better with the related TTPs. T1057-Process Discovery is about understanding the system, and T1657-Financial Theft is about financial impact, which does not necessarily involve the double-extortion ransomware technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible answer is that SUNSPOT is not likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware after monitoring running processes.

**Final Answer: B: No**
