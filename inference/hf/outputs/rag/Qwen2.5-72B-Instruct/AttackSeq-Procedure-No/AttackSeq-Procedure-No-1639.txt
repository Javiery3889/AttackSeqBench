### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying the results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:**
     - This technique involves the adversary using cloud storage services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) to exfiltrate data from the compromised network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves the adversary using automated tools to collect data from the network, such as file and directory lists.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying the results of the discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the adversary will not exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying the results of the discovery phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Typically, an adversary will first perform the discovery phase to identify target systems and data of interest. This involves techniques like T1119-Automated Collection, where the adversary collects file and directory lists from network shared drives.
     - After identifying the data of interest, the adversary will then exfiltrate the data. This is where T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage comes into play.
   - **Logical Order:**
     - It is more logical for the adversary to first collect the data (discovery phase) and then exfiltrate it. Exfiltration to cloud storage would be the final step in the attack sequence, not a step that occurs before the data is collected.
   - **Practical Considerations:**
     - Exfiltrating data without first identifying and collecting it would be inefficient and less likely to achieve the adversary's goals.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
