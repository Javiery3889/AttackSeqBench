### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant, after performing initial reconnaissance, is likely to have communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Command and Control**
     - **Technique: T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**
   - This TTP indicates that the adversary is using a method to communicate with the C2 server in both directions (sending and receiving data).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant did use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.
     - The T1102.002 technique (Bidirectional Communication) is relevant here, as it describes a method for maintaining communication with the C2 server.
     - Blogs and WordPress are known to be used by adversaries for C2 communication because they are publicly accessible and can be used to hide malicious traffic within legitimate traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant did not use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.
     - While this is possible, it does not align with the known TTPs and the context provided by the question and the related TTP.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTP, it is more plausible that the Rising Sun implant used blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
