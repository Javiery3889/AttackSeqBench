### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 only after exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding, and then perform initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using standard encoding schemes like Base64 to obfuscate data.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Base64 Encoding (T1132.001):** The question mentions that data is exfiltrated using Base64 encoding, which aligns with this TTP.
   - **Encrypted/Encoded File (T1027.013):** The question also mentions that the implant will communicate via an encrypted channel using RC4, which aligns with this TTP.
   - **Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140):** This TTP is relevant to the process of making the encoded or encrypted data usable, but it is not directly mentioned in the question.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Exfiltration with Base64 Encoding:** The implant exfiltrates data using Base64 encoding, which is a standard encoding technique.
   - **Communication via RC4:** The implant then communicates with the control server using RC4 encryption, which is a form of encryption.
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:** After establishing communication, the implant performs initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The use of Base64 encoding for exfiltration, followed by communication via RC4 encryption, and then performing initial reconnaissance is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks.
