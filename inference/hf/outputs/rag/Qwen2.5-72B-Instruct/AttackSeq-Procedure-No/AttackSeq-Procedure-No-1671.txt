### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attackers first conduct reconnaissance to gather various types of system information.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access only after completing the initial access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question states that the reconnaissance phase was completed before the initial access phase. This implies that the attackers had already gained some level of access to the system to gather the necessary information.
   - The related TTPs suggest that spear-phishing is a common method for initial access. However, the question specifically asks if the spear-phishing was used only after the initial access phase.
   - If the reconnaissance phase was completed before the initial access phase, it is unlikely that the attackers would use spear-phishing to gain initial access after they have already gained some level of access through reconnaissance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the attackers did not use spear-phishing to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access only after completing the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
