### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the SLUB backdoor:
     - **Discovery:** Downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.
     - **Exfiltration:** Creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders, posting download links to a Slack channel, and then building CAB files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files from the user's Desktop.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can include posting download links to a Slack channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders, posting download links to the Slack channel, and then building CAB files.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique aligns with creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders.
       - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique aligns with collecting data from the user's Desktop.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique aligns with posting download links to a Slack channel.
       - However, the question also mentions building CAB files, which is not explicitly covered by the related TTPs. Building CAB files is a specific form of archiving, but it is not a standard technique listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is not likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While the related TTPs cover archiving and exfiltration, the specific step of building CAB files is not a standard technique and is not mentioned in the related TTPs.
       - The sequence described in the question is more detailed and specific than what is typically covered by the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the described sequence, including building CAB files, is not likely to be a standard part of the attack sequence described by the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
