### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Black Energy 2 is likely to inject a DLL into the `svchost.exe` process to maintain persistence only after the botnet's command-and-control (C2) center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This is a specific type of process injection where a DLL is injected into a process to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Injection into `svchost.exe`:** `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. Injecting a DLL into `svchost.exe` can help the malware maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **C2 Communication:** The question specifies that the DLL injection occurs only after the C2 center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests. This implies that the malware waits for a specific command from the C2 before performing the injection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Black Energy 2 Malware Behavior:** Black Energy 2 is known for its modular architecture and its ability to perform various malicious activities, including process injection and communication with C2 servers.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     1. The malware is initially installed on the victim's system.
     2. The malware establishes a connection with the C2 server.
     3. The C2 server sends a command to the malware.
     4. The malware receives the command and performs the DLL injection into `svchost.exe` to maintain persistence.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that Black Energy 2 would wait for a command from the C2 server before performing the DLL injection. This behavior can help the malware avoid detection and ensure that the injection is performed at a strategic time.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Black Energy 2 injects a DLL into the `svchost.exe` process to maintain persistence only after the botnet's C2 center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
