### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the callCam app.
   - The app collects information during the Discovery phase.
   - It then sends the collected data to the C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - The data is sent using a customized encoding routine during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The data is encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data from a compromised system to a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving data using a custom method before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - This technique is relevant to the Exfiltration phase, where data is sent to the C&C server.
   - **Archive via Custom Method (T1560.003):**
     - This technique is relevant to the Collection phase, where data is compressed or archived before exfiltration.
   - The question states that the data is sent using a customized encoding routine during the Exfiltration phase, which aligns with T1041.
   - The question also mentions that the data is encrypted using RSA and AES during the Collection phase, which aligns with T1560.003 (custom method).

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Discovery Phase:** Collect information.
     2. **Collection Phase:** Encrypt data using RSA and AES.
     3. **Exfiltration Phase:** Send data to C&C server using a customized encoding routine.
   - The related TTPs support the Exfiltration and Collection phases as described.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The data is collected, encrypted, and then exfiltrated using a customized encoding routine, which is a common sequence in cyber attacks.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
