### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a group is likely to deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses, given that they have already used stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002 - Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems and services to identify potential targets for exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046 - Network Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations to understand the network topology and potential entry points.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the group will conduct vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses before deploying public exploits.
     - Given that the group has already used stolen credentials to maintain persistent access, it is logical that they might want to further expand their access or move laterally within the network. Conducting vulnerability scanning is a common next step to identify additional targets for exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the group will not conduct vulnerability scanning before deploying public exploits.
     - This is less likely because, without conducting vulnerability scanning, the group might not have the necessary information to identify and target vulnerable services effectively. This could lead to less successful exploitation attempts and potentially alert the defenders.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, the most plausible sequence is that the group will conduct vulnerability scanning before deploying public exploits.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
