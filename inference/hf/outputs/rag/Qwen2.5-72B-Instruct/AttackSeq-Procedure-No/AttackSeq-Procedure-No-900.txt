### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by an attacker using the CARBANAK RAT to establish connections with a C2 server and deploy secondary malware through obfuscated scripts.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attacker will configure a systemd service to maintain persistence before deploying reconnaissance tools like Cobalt Strike for network discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain command and control.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.002-Systemd Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a systemd service to achieve persistence on Linux systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - The attacker has already executed the CARBANAK RAT to establish connections with the C2 server.
     - Secondary malware has been deployed through obfuscated scripts.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Configuring a systemd service (T1543.002) is a common technique for maintaining persistence on Linux systems.
     - Configuring a Windows service (T1543.003) is a common technique for maintaining persistence on Windows systems.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Deploying reconnaissance tools like Cobalt Strike for network discovery is a common next step after establishing persistence to gather information about the network and identify further targets.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attacker has already established a connection with the C2 server and deployed secondary malware, it is logical to assume that the next step would be to ensure persistence.
   - Configuring a systemd service (if the target is a Linux system) or a Windows service (if the target is a Windows system) is a common and effective way to maintain persistence.
   - After ensuring persistence, the attacker would likely deploy reconnaissance tools like Cobalt Strike to gather more information about the network.
