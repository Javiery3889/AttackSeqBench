### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries manipulate memory and processes to evade detection using functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` only after they have packaged and transmitted data over HTTP/HTTPS to a command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into processes to evade detection. Functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` are often used in process injection to manipulate memory and processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Step 1: Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
       - The adversaries first package and transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS to the C2 server. This is a common initial step in maintaining control over the compromised system.
     - **Step 2: Defense Evasion (Process Injection):**
       - After establishing C2 communication, adversaries might then use techniques like process injection to evade detection. This is because once they have established a foothold and can communicate with the C2 server, they can execute additional malicious activities, such as injecting code into other processes to hide their presence or maintain persistence.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that adversaries would perform process injection and memory manipulation after establishing C2 communication. This is because the C2 communication is often the first step in maintaining control, and subsequent steps like process injection are used to evade detection and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the plausibility of the described actions, the most likely answer is that adversaries would manipulate memory and processes to evade detection only after they have established C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
