### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that victims would leverage the Microsoft Graph API to perform various actions across Azure and M365 environments after gaining initial access through malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails, and before disabling security controls.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate cloud accounts to evade detection and perform malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate cloud accounts to gain higher privileges within the cloud environment.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate cloud accounts to gain initial access to the target environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents. This is a common method for initial access.
   - **Leveraging Microsoft Graph API:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use legitimate cloud accounts to perform various actions. The Microsoft Graph API is a powerful tool that can be used to interact with Azure and M365 environments, allowing attackers to perform a wide range of actions.
   - **Disabling Security Controls:**
     - Before performing more extensive actions, attackers often disable security controls to avoid detection and maintain persistence. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access through phishing, attackers can use legitimate cloud accounts to leverage the Microsoft Graph API for various actions across Azure and M365 environments. This is consistent with the related TTPs, particularly T1078.004-Cloud Accounts, which is listed under Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation, and Initial Access.
