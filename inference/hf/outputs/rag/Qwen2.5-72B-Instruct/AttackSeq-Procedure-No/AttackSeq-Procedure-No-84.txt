### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva, after compressing files with zlib during the Collection tactic, will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library:**
     - This technique involves compressing files using a library, such as zlib, to reduce their size for easier collection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:**
     - This technique involves setting limits on the size of data transferred to avoid detection. If the data exceeds a certain size, it may be divided into smaller chunks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Vyveva will divide files if they are 16 MB or more during the Exfiltration tactic.
     - Given the related TTP T1030 (Data Transfer Size Limits), it is plausible that Vyveva would implement size limits to avoid detection. Dividing files into smaller chunks is a common method to manage large data transfers and reduce the risk of being noticed by network monitoring tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Vyveva will not divide files if they are 16 MB or more during the Exfiltration tactic.
     - This is less likely given the context of T1030, which specifically mentions setting size limits and dividing data to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that Vyveva will divide files if they are 16 MB or more during the Exfiltration tactic to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
