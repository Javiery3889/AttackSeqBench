### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FIN13.
   - They use JSPRAT for local command execution and BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution.
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to persist via startup options for Login Items before using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump to escalate privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.015-Login Items:** This technique involves adding a program to the list of items that are executed when a user logs in.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.015-Login Items:** This technique is listed again, emphasizing the use of Login Items for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Login Items (T1547.015):** This technique is used to ensure that the malware or tools are executed every time a user logs in, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1068):** This technique involves using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump to exploit vulnerabilities and gain higher-level privileges.
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to persist via Login Items before escalating privileges. Given the related TTPs, it is logical to assume that FIN13 would first ensure persistence to maintain a foothold in the system before attempting to escalate privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that FIN13 would persist via Login Items before using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump to escalate privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
