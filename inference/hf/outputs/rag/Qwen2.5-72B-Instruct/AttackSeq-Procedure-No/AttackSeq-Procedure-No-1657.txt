### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the FHAPPI campaign is likely to use fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing a connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15.
   - The key points are:
     - Execution of encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads.
     - Establishing a connection with the C2 server.
     - Use of fileless techniques to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication with the C2 server to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, often for downloading and executing payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Execution (T1059.001):**
     - The use of encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads is a common initial step in many campaigns, including FHAPPI.
   - **Multi-Stage Channels (T1104):**
     - This technique suggests that the campaign uses multiple stages of communication with the C2 server. This can include initial communication to download additional tools or payloads, and subsequent communication to maintain control and execute further actions.
   - **Fileless Techniques:**
     - Fileless techniques are often used to avoid detection by traditional file-based security solutions. They involve executing code directly in memory without writing to the disk.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the initial PowerShell commands are used to download and execute payloads, and then the campaign establishes a connection with the C2 server.
     - After establishing the connection, it is plausible that the campaign would use fileless techniques to avoid detection, as this would help maintain persistence and evade security measures.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the use of multi-stage channels and the common practice of using fileless techniques to avoid detection, it is likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques after establishing a connection with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
