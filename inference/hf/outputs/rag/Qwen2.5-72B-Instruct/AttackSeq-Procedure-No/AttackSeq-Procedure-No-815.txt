### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer, after communicating with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA, will process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography (RSA) to encrypt communication keys (AES) for secure communication with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting and staging data locally before exfiltration, often in a temporary directory like %TEMP%.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique confirms that WinDealer uses RSA to encrypt the AES key for secure communication with C2 servers. This is consistent with the initial part of the question.
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique indicates that WinDealer collects and stages data locally before exfiltration, which aligns with the idea of processing and encrypting stolen data in the %TEMP% directory.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The question specifically asks about the exfiltration phase, where data is prepared for transfer. Staging data in the %TEMP% directory and encrypting it as ".a" files is a plausible step in this phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that WinDealer will process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
