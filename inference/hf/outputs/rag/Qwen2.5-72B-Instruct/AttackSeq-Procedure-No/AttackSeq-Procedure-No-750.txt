### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Rising Sun implant:
     - Initial reconnaissance to collect system and network details.
     - Communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository, such as GitHub.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The implant has already established a communication channel with the control servers using HTTP POST requests. This channel is used for both command and control and potentially for exfiltration (T1041).
     - Additionally, the related TTPs include T1567.001, which specifically mentions exfiltration to code repositories like GitHub.
     - Given that the implant has already demonstrated sophisticated techniques for communication and data handling, it is plausible that it could use GitHub for data exfiltration as an additional or alternative method.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the implant would not use GitHub for data exfiltration.
     - However, the presence of T1567.001 in the related TTPs indicates that exfiltration to code repositories is a known technique and could be used by the implant.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sophisticated nature of the Rising Sun implant, it is likely that the implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
