### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Suckfly scans the internal network for specific open ports (8080, 5900, and 40) to identify potential expansion points.
   - It then asks if Suckfly is likely to gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services (such as Azure AD Connect) from a local machine before using hacktools to move laterally within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves scanning the network to identify active hosts, open ports, and services. This aligns with the initial scanning activity described in the question.
   - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within the network. This aligns with the lateral movement described in the question.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement. This also aligns with the lateral movement described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Scanning (T1046):** The question mentions scanning for open ports 8080, 5900, and 40. This is a clear example of network service discovery (T1046).
   - **Gathering Credentials:** The question asks if Suckfly is likely to gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services from a local machine. This is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a common step in the attack chain before lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1021.002 and T1570):** The question mentions using hacktools to move laterally within the network, which aligns with both T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) and T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer).

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical attack path: scanning the network to identify targets, gathering credentials, and then using those credentials to move laterally.
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention gathering credentials for Azure AD services, it is a common and logical step in the attack chain before lateral movement.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Suckfly would gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services from a local machine before moving laterally.
