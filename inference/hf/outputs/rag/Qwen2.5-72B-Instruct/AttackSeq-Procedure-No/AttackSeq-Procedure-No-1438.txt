### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities in the StellarParticle campaign:
     - Discovery activities using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
     - Accessing files from victims' OneDrive environments.
     - Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using existing domain accounts to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information is a common discovery technique. This helps the threat actor understand the network structure and identify potential targets.
   - **Accessing OneDrive Files:**
     - Accessing files from victims' OneDrive environments is a plausible next step after discovery. OneDrive is often used for file storage and sharing, making it a valuable target for exfiltration of sensitive information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally is a common technique for spreading through the network. Privileged accounts can provide access to more critical systems, while non-privileged accounts can be used to maintain a low profile and avoid detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. The threat actor first performs discovery to understand the environment, then accesses valuable files, and finally uses RDP to move laterally, potentially using both types of accounts to achieve their goals.

### Final Answer
