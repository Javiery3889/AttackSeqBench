### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions as part of its data destruction activities after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion of data to disrupt availability or conceal other actions.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe:** This technique involves wiping the structure of disks to render them unusable, which is a more severe form of data destruction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files and disk structures.
     - The related TTPs T1485 (Data Destruction) and T1561.002 (Disk Structure Wipe) align with the described activities of CaddyWiper, which is known for its data destruction capabilities.
     - The sequence of events described in the question (awaiting commands from C2 servers, then deploying CaddyWiper) is consistent with the typical behavior of advanced malware that performs data destruction as part of its impact phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Agrius is not likely to deploy CaddyWiper.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that data destruction and disk structure wiping are part of the impact phase of the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described sequence of events, the most plausible answer is that Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper to perform data destruction activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
