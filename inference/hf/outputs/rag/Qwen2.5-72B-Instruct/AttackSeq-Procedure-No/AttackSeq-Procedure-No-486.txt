### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FamousSparrow is likely to perform specific actions during the Discovery phase after dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.
   - The actions in question are:
     - Retrieving metadata for files on disk.
     - Listing the current working directory.
     - Reading file contents.
     - Exfiltrating files to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data on a system, which is not directly relevant to the Discovery phase or the actions described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths, which is directly relevant to the actions of listing the current working directory and retrieving metadata for files on disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow is likely to perform the described actions during the Discovery phase.
     - The related TTP T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) supports the idea that an adversary would list the current working directory and retrieve metadata for files on disk as part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow is not likely to perform the described actions during the Discovery phase.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTP T1083, which indicates that such actions are part of the Discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP T1083 (File and Directory Discovery), it is plausible that FamousSparrow would perform the described actions during the Discovery phase after dumping credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
