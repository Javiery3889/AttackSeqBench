### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement only after deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office for Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.001-Office Template Macros:**
     - This technique involves inserting malicious macros into Office templates to ensure that the malware persists across system reboots or user sessions.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into templates or documents to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1137.001-Office Template Macros):**
     - This technique is used to ensure that the malicious macros are loaded every time a user opens a document, which helps in maintaining persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1221-Template Injection):**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into templates or documents to evade detection. It can be used to modify existing documents or templates to include malicious macros.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. While injecting malicious macros into documents on other systems can be a form of lateral movement, the question specifically asks about the sequence of actions.
   - **Defense Evasion (Deactivating Security Mechanisms):**
     - Deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office (e.g., disabling macro warnings) is a common technique used to ensure that the malicious macros can run without user intervention or detection.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This would mean that Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement only after deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This would mean that Gamaredon will not necessarily inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement only after deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that Gamaredon uses both persistence and defense evasion techniques. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of actions for lateral movement.
   - While deactivating security mechanisms is a common step in defense evasion, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for injecting malicious macros into documents for lateral movement. The injection of macros can occur independently of deactivating security mechanisms, especially if the attacker has already gained sufficient access to the system.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement only after deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.

### Final Answer: B: No
