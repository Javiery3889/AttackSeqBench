### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SkinnyBoy will obfuscate C2 traffic with an altered version of base64 before communicating with the C2 server using an HTTP POST request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding methods (e.g., base64) to obfuscate C2 traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SkinnyBoy is likely to use an altered version of base64 to obfuscate C2 traffic.
     - The related TTP T1132.001-Standard Encoding indicates that standard encoding methods, including base64, are commonly used to obfuscate C2 traffic.
     - However, the question specifically asks about an "altered version" of base64, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SkinnyBoy is not likely to use an altered version of base64 to obfuscate C2 traffic.
     - The related TTP T1132.001-Standard Encoding only mentions standard encoding methods, not altered versions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While the related TTPs indicate that standard encoding methods like base64 are commonly used, they do not specifically mention altered versions of base64.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided, it is more plausible to conclude that SkinnyBoy is not likely to use an altered version of base64 to obfuscate C2 traffic.

### Final Answer: B: No
