### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dexphot, after using fileless techniques for defense evasion, is likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This indicates that process hollowing is a technique used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This indicates that process hollowing is also used for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Fileless Techniques for Defense Evasion:** Fileless techniques are used to avoid detection by operating in memory and without writing files to disk. This is a common tactic for malware to evade traditional file-based detection mechanisms.
   - **Process Hollowing:** Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is started in a suspended state, its memory is replaced with malicious code, and then the process is resumed. This technique is used to run malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process, which can help in both defense evasion and privilege escalation.
   - **Dexphot Malware:** Dexphot is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, including fileless execution and process injection. Given its focus on evading detection, it is plausible that Dexphot would use process hollowing to further obfuscate its activities and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known behavior of Dexphot, it is likely that Dexphot would use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
