### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use `verclsid.exe` to download and execute a malicious script after disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names, and then use command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming malware files to match legitimate files or placing them in legitimate locations to avoid detection.
   - **T1036 - Masquerading:** This is a broader technique that includes T1036.005 and involves making malware appear legitimate to evade detection.
   - **T1218.012 - Verclsid:** This technique involves using `verclsid.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility, to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Disguising Executable Malware Files:**
     - The T1036.005 and T1036 techniques align with the first part of the question, where attackers disguise malware files with legitimate names.
   - **Using `verclsid.exe` to Download and Execute a Malicious Script:**
     - The T1218.012 technique aligns with the use of `verclsid.exe` to execute malicious code. However, the question specifically mentions downloading and executing a script, which is not explicitly covered by T1218.012. `verclsid.exe` is typically used to execute code, but not necessarily to download it.
   - **Using C2 Infrastructure with Changing and Static IPs on DynDNS:**
     - This part of the question is not directly covered by the provided TTPs. However, it is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios to use dynamic DNS (DynDNS) services to maintain C2 communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The first part of the question (disguising malware files) is well-supported by the T1036.005 and T1036 techniques.
   - The use of `verclsid.exe` to execute malicious code is supported by T1218.012, but the specific mention of downloading a script is not explicitly covered.
   - The C2 infrastructure part is a common tactic but not directly supported by the provided TTPs.

Given the alignment of the first two parts with the provided TTPs and the commonality of the C2 infrastructure part, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
