### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that operators would use the `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` function to detect the presence of a debugger after using registry queries for system information collection, before proceeding to command and control (C2) activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1012-Query Registry (Discovery):** This technique involves querying the registry to gather system information, which can include details about the operating system, installed software, and other configuration settings.
   - **T1622-Debugger Evasion (Discovery):** This technique involves using methods to detect the presence of a debugger, which can help the attacker avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Queries (T1012):** The use of functions like `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` to query the registry is a common method for gathering system information. This is part of the discovery phase where the attacker collects data about the target system.
   - **Debugger Evasion (T1622):** The `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` function is used to detect if a debugger is attached to the process. This is a defensive measure to ensure that the malware is not being analyzed or monitored, which is crucial for maintaining stealth and avoiding detection.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Activities:** After gathering system information and ensuring that the environment is safe (i.e., no debugger is present), the attacker would likely proceed to establish C2 communication using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - It is logical for an attacker to perform debugger evasion before engaging in C2 activities. This is because C2 communication is a critical phase where the malware communicates with the attacker's server, and any detection during this phase could lead to the compromise of the attack.
   - The sequence of TTPs (T1012 followed by T1622) aligns with the typical attack flow where the attacker first gathers information, then ensures the environment is safe, and finally establishes C2 communication.
