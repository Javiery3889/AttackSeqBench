### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Smooth Operator malware establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation after exfiltrating data via a HTTP GET request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP GET Request for Exfiltration:**
     - The question states that the malware has already exfiltrated data using a HTTP GET request. This aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves exfiltration over the C2 channel.
   - **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers Over HTTPS:**
     - The T1071.001 technique mentions the use of web protocols, including HTTPS, for C2 communication. It is common for malware to switch to HTTPS for secure communication after initial exfiltration to avoid detection.
   - **Custom Data Encoding Algorithm for Obfuscation:**
     - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention custom data encoding, it is a common practice in malware to use obfuscation techniques to evade detection. This is often part of the C2 communication to ensure that the data being transmitted is not easily readable by network security tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the common practices in malware, it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
