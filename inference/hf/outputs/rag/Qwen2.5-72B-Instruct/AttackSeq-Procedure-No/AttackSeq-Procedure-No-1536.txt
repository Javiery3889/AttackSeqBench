### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a UEFI rootkit like LoJax would manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection after these scripts have collected system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.001-System Firmware:**
     - This technique involves modifying system firmware, such as UEFI, to maintain persistence. UEFI rootkits like LoJax can persist across system reboots and OS reinstalls.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of an attack and evade detection. This can include cleaning up scripts and other artifacts used during the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - UEFI rootkits like LoJax are designed to maintain persistence and evade detection. After the initial reconnaissance and information collection (using scripts like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'), it is plausible that the rootkit would delete these files to cover its tracks and avoid leaving evidence that could be detected by security tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the UEFI rootkit would not manage the deletion of these files. However, given the nature of UEFI rootkits and their focus on persistence and evasion, this seems less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the nature of UEFI rootkits, it is more plausible that the rootkit would manage the deletion of files to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
