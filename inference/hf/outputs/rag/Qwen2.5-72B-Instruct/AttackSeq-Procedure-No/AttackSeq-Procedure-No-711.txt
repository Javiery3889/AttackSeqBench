### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gallmaker will use specific tools (WindowsRoamingToolsTask and reverse_tcp payload) for execution only after exploiting the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to gain initial access.
   - The key points are:
     - Living off the land (LotL) tactics for defense evasion.
     - Use of WindowsRoamingToolsTask and reverse_tcp payload for execution.
     - Exploiting the DDE protocol for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:**
     - This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute code, which is a common method for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using the DDE protocol in Microsoft Office to execute commands or open files, which can be used for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Living off the Land (LotL) Tactics:**
     - LotL tactics involve using legitimate system tools to perform malicious activities, which aligns with the use of rundll32.exe for defense evasion.
   - **Exploiting DDE Protocol:**
     - The DDE protocol can be used to execute commands or open files, which is a common method for gaining initial access.
   - **Use of WindowsRoamingToolsTask and reverse_tcp Payload:**
     - These tools are typically used for execution and maintaining persistence or establishing a reverse shell, which would logically follow after gaining initial access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     - **Step 1:** Gallmaker uses LotL tactics, which aligns with the use of rundll32.exe for defense evasion.
     - **Step 2:** Gallmaker exploits the DDE protocol in Microsoft Office to gain initial access.
     - **Step 3:** After gaining initial access, Gallmaker uses tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask and the reverse_tcp payload for execution and maintaining control.
