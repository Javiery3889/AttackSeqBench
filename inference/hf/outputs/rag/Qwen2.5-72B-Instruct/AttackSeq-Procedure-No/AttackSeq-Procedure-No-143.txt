### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack group gathered user credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains only after leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into the victim networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves using a drive-by compromise to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials as part of reconnaissance activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** The question mentions leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into the victim networks. This aligns with the T1189 technique, which involves using a drive-by compromise to gain initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):** After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to gather credentials. This aligns with the T1589.001 technique, which involves gathering credentials as part of reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1534-Internal Spearphishing):** Once the attackers have the credentials, they might use internal spearphishing to move laterally within the network. However, the question specifically asks about gathering credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains, which is more aligned with the initial access phase rather than lateral movement.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (gaining initial access through an unpatched vulnerability and then gathering credentials through phishing domains) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - However, the question specifically asks if the phishing domains were used only after gaining initial access. Given that phishing is often used as an initial access technique, it is less likely that the phishing domains were used only after gaining initial access through the unpatched vulnerability.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
