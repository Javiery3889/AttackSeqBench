### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers will ensure persistence within the target network only after executing malicious code on a local or remote system, following the use of increased privileges to spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network. It is often used to gain access to additional systems or to escalate privileges.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using local accounts to maintain persistence on a system. Local accounts can be used to ensure that the attacker can regain access to the system even if the initial access method is discovered and mitigated.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account:**
     - This technique is similar to T1078.003 and involves creating or modifying local accounts to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that attackers will ensure persistence only after executing malicious code on a local or remote system.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Lateral movement (T1534) is often a precursor to persistence. Once the attacker has moved laterally and gained access to additional systems, they may then execute malicious code to establish persistence.
       - The related TTPs (T1078.003 and T1136.001) both involve using local accounts to maintain persistence, which typically requires the execution of some form of malicious code to create or modify these accounts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that attackers will ensure persistence without necessarily executing malicious code on a local or remote system.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While it is possible for attackers to use other methods to ensure persistence (e.g., social engineering, exploiting existing vulnerabilities), the related TTPs (T1078.003 and T1136.001) strongly indicate that the creation or modification of local accounts, which typically involves executing malicious code, is a common method for ensuring persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack stages, the most plausible answer is that attackers will ensure persistence within the target network only after executing malicious code on a local or remote system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
