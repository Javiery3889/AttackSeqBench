### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware first queries the registry to identify victim machines (Discovery phase).
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to achieve persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system, which aligns with the initial discovery phase described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This technique involves removing or clearing existing persistence mechanisms, which is not directly relevant to the question.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding entries to the registry run keys or startup folder to ensure the malware runs at system startup, which aligns with the persistence phase described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the malware will add Intel-related files to registry run keys, which is a form of persistence (T1547.001).
   - The question also mentions that the malware will impersonate a legitimate Symantec executable, which is a form of defense evasion. However, the specific technique T1070.009 (Clear Persistence) is not directly relevant to this part of the question.
   - The sequence described in the question (querying the registry, achieving persistence, and impersonating a legitimate executable) is a plausible and common attack pattern.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence, the most plausible answer is that the malware will indeed achieve persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
