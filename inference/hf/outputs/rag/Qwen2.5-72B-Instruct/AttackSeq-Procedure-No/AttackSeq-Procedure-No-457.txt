### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use a specific sequence of TTPs:
     - Target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.
     - Exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.
     - Use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves making a file or program appear legitimate or benign to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - This technique is commonly used to deliver malicious files, such as HWP files, to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading):**
     - This technique is used to make the malicious files appear legitimate to avoid detection by security systems.
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The question suggests a sequence where attackers first target specific groups with impersonated documents, then use a Ghostscript vulnerability in HWP files for initial access, and finally use simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion.
     - The sequence is plausible because:
       - **Targeting specific groups with impersonated documents** aligns with the initial step of spearphishing.
       - **Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files** is a common method for initial access.
       - **Using simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion** can be a subsequent step to avoid detection after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
