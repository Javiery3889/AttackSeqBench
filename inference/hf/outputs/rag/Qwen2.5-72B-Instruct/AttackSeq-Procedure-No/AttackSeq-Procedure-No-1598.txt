### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether MuddyWater is likely to use asymmetric cryptography (RSA) to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic after gaining initial access through a decoy document exploiting CVE-2017-0199.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1573.002 - Asymmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography (such as RSA) to encrypt C2 traffic, which can help in evading detection and ensuring secure communication between the attacker and the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - MuddyWater uses a decoy document exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access. This is a known technique used by the group to deliver malware and establish a foothold in the target network.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The related TTP (T1573.002) indicates that asymmetric cryptography is a technique used for securing C2 communications. This is a common practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to ensure that their C2 traffic is not easily intercepted or analyzed by defenders.
   - **MuddyWater's TTPs:**
     - MuddyWater is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection. Using asymmetric cryptography for C2 traffic aligns with their advanced capabilities and operational security practices.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTP and the known practices of MuddyWater, it is likely that the group would use asymmetric cryptography such as RSA to encrypt C2 traffic after gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
