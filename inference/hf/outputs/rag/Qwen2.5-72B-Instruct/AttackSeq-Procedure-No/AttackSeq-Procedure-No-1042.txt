### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether POWERSHOWER, after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server, is likely to use external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic, as part of maintaining Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic through intermediate systems, often to obfuscate the true source of the traffic or to bypass network defenses.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This is a broader category that includes various proxy techniques, including external proxies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that POWERSHOWER is likely to use external proxy techniques to maintain Command and Control.
     - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1090.002-External Proxy, it is plausible that POWERSHOWER would use external proxies to relay command traffic. This technique is commonly used to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that POWERSHOWER is not likely to use external proxy techniques.
     - However, the related TTPs indicate that external proxy techniques are a known method for maintaining Command and Control, which makes this choice less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of external proxies in maintaining Command and Control, the most plausible answer is that POWERSHOWER is likely to use external proxy techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
