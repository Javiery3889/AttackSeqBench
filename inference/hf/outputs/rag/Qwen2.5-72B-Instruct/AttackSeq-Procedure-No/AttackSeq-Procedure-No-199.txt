### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement before using Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves accessing credentials stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer):** The use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe is a common method for lateral movement. These tools allow attackers to execute commands on remote systems, which is a key step in moving laterally within a network.
   - **Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory):** The use of Mimikatz to access credentials from LSASS memory is a common technique for credential access. This is typically done after gaining initial access and possibly after lateral movement to gather more credentials.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** The question states that the initial compromise is done using GreyEnergy mini.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After the initial compromise, the next logical step is to move laterally within the network. Using tools like PsExec and WinExe aligns with the T1570 technique.
   - **Network Mapping and Credential Collection:** Once the attackers have moved laterally, they would likely use tools like Nmap to map the network and Mimikatz to collect credentials. This aligns with the T1003.001 technique.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (lateral movement using PsExec and WinExe, followed by network mapping and credential collection using Nmap and Mimikatz) is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs based on the related TTPs provided.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
