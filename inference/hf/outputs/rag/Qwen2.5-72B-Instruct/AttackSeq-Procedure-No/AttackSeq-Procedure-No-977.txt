### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages, given that persistence is established via a scheduled task named "SystemFailureReporter."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Microsoft Word document, which can execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves an adversary creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence, ensuring that the malicious code runs at specific intervals or under certain conditions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Malicious Document:**
     - The T1204.002 technique (Malicious File) aligns with the scenario where a user is tricked into opening a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages. This is a common initial access vector.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - The T1053.005 technique (Scheduled Task) aligns with the scenario where a scheduled task named "SystemFailureReporter" is used to maintain persistence. This is a common method for ensuring that the malicious code continues to run even after the initial access.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the initial access is gained via the malicious document, and then persistence is established via the scheduled task. This sequence is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages, and then establish persistence via a scheduled task.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
