### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000, after capturing audio from Skype users, is likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for constant execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1123-Audio Capture:** This technique involves capturing audio data, which aligns with the initial part of the question where T9000 captures audio from Skype users.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying registry keys to ensure that certain programs run at startup, which is a method of establishing persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is also about modifying registry keys to ensure that certain programs run at startup, which is another method of establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 is likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
     - The related TTPs indicate that modifying registry keys (T1547.001) is a common method for establishing persistence.
     - Injecting a DLL into explorer.exe is a common technique to ensure that a malicious payload runs continuously.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 is not likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that modifying registry keys is a common method for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common methods of establishing persistence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T9000 would indeed modify registry keys and inject ResN32.dll into explorer.exe to ensure constant execution.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
