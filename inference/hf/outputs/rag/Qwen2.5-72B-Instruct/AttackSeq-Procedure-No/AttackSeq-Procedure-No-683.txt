### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers:
     - Deploy worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     - Exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - Use command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     - Achieve their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - The question asks whether the attackers will execute cryptocurrency mining scripts only after achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003 - Malicious Image:**
     - This technique involves using malicious images, such as container images, to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001 - Compute Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking compute resources, such as using them for cryptocurrency mining.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Initial Access:**
       - Deploy worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
       - Exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - **Execution:**
       - Use command interpreters to execute malicious code, such as cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     - **Impact:**
       - Achieve resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - The attackers need to gain initial access and execute malicious code (cryptocurrency mining scripts) to achieve their ultimate objective of resource hijacking.
     - The execution of cryptocurrency mining scripts is a step in the process of achieving resource hijacking, not a separate action that occurs only after the objective is achieved.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical flow and the sequence of TTPs, the attackers will execute cryptocurrency mining scripts as part of the process of achieving resource hijacking, not only after achieving it.

**Final Answer: B: No**
