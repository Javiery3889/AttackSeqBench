### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion only after disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names for execution.
   - The sequence of actions described is:
     1. Utilize command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.
     2. Disguise executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names.
     3. Use untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1553.002 - Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using digital signatures to make malware appear legitimate and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: C2 Infrastructure with DynDNS:**
     - This is a common tactic for maintaining communication with compromised systems. It is not directly related to the question but sets the context for the attack.
   - **Step 2: Disguise Executable Malware Files:**
     - This aligns with T1036.005, where attackers name or place files to appear legitimate.
   - **Step 3: Use Untrusted and Faked Digital Signatures:**
     - This aligns with T1553.002, where attackers use digital signatures to make malware appear legitimate.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Attackers often use a combination of techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. Disguising malware with legitimate names (T1036.005) and using faked digital signatures (T1553.002) are both common tactics in the defense evasion phase of an attack.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
