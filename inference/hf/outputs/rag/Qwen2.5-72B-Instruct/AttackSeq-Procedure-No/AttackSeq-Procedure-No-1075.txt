### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Tropic Trooper after gaining initial access through CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - Specifically, it asks if the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) was used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe before the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to gain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tropic Trooper gains initial access through CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - **DLL Side-Loading:**
     - The malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) is used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. This aligns with the T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading technique for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **Backdoor Installer:**
     - The system configuration file drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe). This step is typically performed after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Step 1: Initial Access:**
     - Tropic Trooper exploits CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain initial access.
   - **Step 2: DLL Side-Loading:**
     - The malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) is used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to establish persistence and evade detection.
   - **Step 3: Backdoor Installer:**
     - The system configuration file drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) to further entrench the malware.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) is likely used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe before the system configuration file drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).
