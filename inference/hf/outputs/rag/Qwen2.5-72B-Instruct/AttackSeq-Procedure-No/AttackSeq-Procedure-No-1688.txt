### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials after persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to intercept and collect network traffic, which can include credentials.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for later use, which can be part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique is also listed under the Collection tactic, indicating that it can be used to collect data, including credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Configuring applications to run batch files every hour):** This is a common method to ensure that the attacker's tools or malware continue to run on the victim's system.
   - **ARP Cache Poisoning (T1557.002):** This technique is used to intercept network traffic, which can include credentials. It is a method to collect credentials, which aligns with the Credential Access and Collection tactics.
   - **Uploading credentials to an external FTP server:** This is a common exfiltration technique where collected credentials are sent to a server controlled by the attacker.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves persistence, followed by credential collection, and then exfiltration.
   - ARP cache poisoning is a plausible method for collecting credentials, especially in a networked environment.
   - The related TTPs support the use of ARP cache poisoning for both credential access and collection.
   - Uploading collected credentials to an external FTP server is a logical next step after collecting them.
