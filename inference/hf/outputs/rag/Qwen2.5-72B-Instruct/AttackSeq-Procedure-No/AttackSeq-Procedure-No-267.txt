### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug malware, after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media, is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol before gathering data from network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, etc.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, such as files, registry entries, and other local resources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question implies a sequence of actions:
     1. Collect data from local systems.
     2. Collect data from removable media.
     3. Exfiltrate the collected data via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
     4. Gather data from network shared drives.
   - The related TTPs only cover the first two steps (T1005 and T1025) and do not mention data exfiltration or gathering data from network shared drives.
   - The question specifically asks if the malware is likely to exfiltrate data before gathering data from network shared drives. However, the related TTPs do not provide information about the exfiltration method or the sequence of gathering data from network shared drives.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the provided TTPs, there is no information to support the claim that Korplug malware will exfiltrate data via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol before gathering data from network shared drives. The TTPs only cover the collection of data from local systems and removable media.

### Final Answer: B: No
