### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SLUB malware, after collecting system information and capturing screenshots during the Discovery phase, will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique describes the method by which an adversary exfiltrates data from a victim network to a C2 server over a command and control channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.
     - Given the related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), it is plausible that the malware would use this technique to exfiltrate the data. The Discovery phase (collecting system information and capturing screenshots) is often followed by the Exfiltration phase, where the collected data is sent to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.
     - This would imply that the malware either does not have the capability to exfiltrate data or that the exfiltration is not part of its automated process, which is less likely given the context of the related TTP.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) and the typical sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack, it is more plausible that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
