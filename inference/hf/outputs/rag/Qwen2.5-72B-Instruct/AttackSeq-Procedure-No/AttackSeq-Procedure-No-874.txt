### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Exploiting Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities for initial access.
     - Achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
     - Using a Stager module to encode C2 traffic using Base64.
     - Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate command and control (C2) traffic, often using Base64 encoding.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows, which aligns with T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application).
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question mentions using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 for privilege escalation, which aligns with T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation).
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question asks if the Stager module will encode C2 traffic using Base64. This aligns with T1132.001 (Standard Encoding).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The use of Base64 encoding for C2 traffic is a common technique to obfuscate communication and avoid detection.
