### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the use of scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and specific commands to scan a range of IP addresses for open ports (445, 3389, 1433, 3306, 80, 443).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actor, Earth Lusca, will use pass the ticket methods for lateral movement after the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems to facilitate movement.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and open ports on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of HUC Port Banner Scanner and the command `hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443` is clearly part of the discovery phase, where the threat actor is identifying open ports and services on the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The related TTPs include both Pass the Hash (T1550.002) and Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570). These techniques are commonly used for lateral movement.
     - Pass the Hash involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate to other systems, which is a common method for lateral movement.
     - Lateral Tool Transfer involves transferring tools to other systems, which can be used in conjunction with Pass the Hash to move laterally.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the threat actor has already performed network service discovery, it is likely that they will use the information gathered to facilitate lateral movement.
   - Pass the Hash (T1550.002) is a common and effective method for lateral movement, especially after discovering open ports and services that may be vulnerable to credential reuse.
