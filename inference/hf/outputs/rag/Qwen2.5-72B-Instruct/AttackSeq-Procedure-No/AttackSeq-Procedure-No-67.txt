### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CCleaner binary will execute malicious code by calling a specific function (`CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`) and decrypting a malicious payload only after being downloaded as part of a compromised CCleaner 5.33 installation package signed with a valid digital certificate.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
     - This technique involves using a valid digital certificate to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate to security systems and users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the CCleaner binary will execute malicious code by calling the specified function and decrypting the payload after being downloaded as part of a compromised installation package signed with a valid digital certificate.
     - This aligns with the T1553.002-Code Signing technique, where the attackers use a valid digital certificate to sign the malicious code, making it appear legitimate.
     - The sequence described in the question is consistent with known attack patterns where attackers compromise legitimate software and sign it with valid certificates to evade detection.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence is not likely.
     - However, this does not align with the T1553.002-Code Signing technique, which is a common method used by attackers to evade defenses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
