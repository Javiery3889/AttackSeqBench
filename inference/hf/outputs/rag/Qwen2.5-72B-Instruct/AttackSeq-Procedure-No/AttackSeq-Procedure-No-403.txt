### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete is likely to copy files to a special USB device only before achieving persistence.
   - The context is that Machete has already achieved persistence by creating a task named 'Microsoft_up' and storing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves copying files to removable media to spread the malware.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating a scheduled task to achieve persistence.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying registry run keys or startup folders to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question states that Machete has already achieved persistence by creating a scheduled task and storing the malware in a specific directory.
   - The related TTPs confirm that Machete uses scheduled tasks (T1053.005) and potentially registry run keys (T1547.001) for persistence.
   - The T1091 technique (Replication Through Removable Media) is a method for spreading the malware, but it is not necessarily tied to the timing of achieving persistence.
   - Given that Machete has already achieved persistence, it is unlikely that it would copy files to a special USB device only before achieving persistence. Instead, it is more plausible that the malware would use removable media for further propagation after establishing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that Machete would not copy files to a special USB device only before achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
