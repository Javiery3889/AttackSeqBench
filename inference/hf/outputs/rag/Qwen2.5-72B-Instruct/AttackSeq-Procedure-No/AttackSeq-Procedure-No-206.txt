### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BLACKGEARâ€™s malware tools will use the AppDomainManager injection technique for Persistence before retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs for Command and Control.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access through Japanese language fake documents.
     - Use of AppDomainManager injection for Persistence.
     - Retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**
     - This technique involves using the AppDomainManager to inject code into a .NET application, which can be used for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614.001-System Language Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the system language, which can be relevant for targeting specific language users.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**
     - This technique is listed again, emphasizing the use of AppDomainManager for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through Japanese language fake documents. This aligns with the T1614.001-System Language Discovery technique, as the attackers are likely targeting Japanese-speaking users.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question asks if the malware will use AppDomainManager injection for persistence. The T1574.014-AppDomainManager technique is listed under both Persistence and Defense Evasion, indicating that it is a plausible method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question mentions retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs. While this specific technique is not listed in the related TTPs, it is a common method for C&C communication and is consistent with the behavior of many malware families.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     - **Initial Access:** Through Japanese language fake documents (T1614.001-System Language Discovery).
     - **Persistence:** Using AppDomainManager injection (T1574.014-AppDomainManager).
     - **Command and Control:** Retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs (common C&C technique).
