### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the Pupy backdoor communicates with a command and control (C2) server using the obfs3 protocol for masking Tor communications.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the NewsBeef APT used improved JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communications.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to mask the true destination of C2 traffic.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This is relevant to the initial communication with the C2 server using web protocols, which aligns with the use of the obfs3 protocol for Tor communications.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This is also relevant to the initial communication, as it describes a method to further mask the C2 traffic.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This is relevant to the second part of the question, which asks about the use of improved JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques for defense evasion.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of the obfs3 protocol for Tor communications (T1071.001 and T1090.003) is a method to evade detection and maintain C2 communications.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the NewsBeef APT used improved JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques for defense evasion. The T1027 technique (Obfuscated Files or Information) directly supports this.
   - Given that the APT group is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection, it is plausible that they would use improved JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques to further evade defenses.
