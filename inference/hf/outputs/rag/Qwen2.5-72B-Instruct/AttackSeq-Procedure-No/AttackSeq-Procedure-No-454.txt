### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT-TOCS is likely to use removable media for command and control (C2) operations after it has performed lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to spread malware or move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media to communicate with a command and control server or to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media):**
     - This technique is used to spread malware or move laterally within a network. It is a common method for APTs to move from one system to another within an internal network.
   - **Command and Control (T1092-Communication Through Removable Media):**
     - This technique is used to communicate with a command and control server or to exfiltrate data. It is a method for maintaining control over compromised systems and for sending data back to the attacker.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question states that APT-TOCS has already performed lateral movement through network projection. This suggests that the APT has already spread within the internal network.
   - Given that the APT has already moved laterally, it is plausible that it might use removable media for command and control operations. This is because:
     - Removable media can be used to bypass network security measures and maintain communication in environments where network-based C2 is restricted or monitored.
     - Removable media can be physically transported between systems, allowing the APT to maintain control over compromised systems even if network communication is limited.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the reasoning above, it is plausible that APT-TOCS would use removable media for command and control operations after lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
