### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase after distributing it via a malicious domain during the resource development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves the acquisition of domains to support malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves the registration of domains to support malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Hidden Cobra used a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform to distribute the Bankshot implant. This aligns with the T1583.001 and T1584.001 techniques, which involve the acquisition and registration of domains to support malicious activities.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Once the Bankshot implant is distributed, it is common for attackers to use the malware to collect information on the victim organization. This is a typical next step in the attack lifecycle, where the malware is used to gather intelligence about the target environment.
   - **Bankshot Malware:**
     - Bankshot is a malware implant known for its capabilities to perform various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and reconnaissance. It is designed to help the attackers understand the victim's network and systems better.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the capabilities of the Bankshot malware, it is highly likely that Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
