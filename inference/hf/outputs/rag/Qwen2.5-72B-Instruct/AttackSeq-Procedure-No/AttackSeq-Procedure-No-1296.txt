### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CozyDuke, after establishing persistence through methods like registry modifications or COM-object hijacking, is likely to communicate with its C&C server using the Jabber/XMPP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) for command and control (C&C) communication.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking Component Object Model (COM) objects to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking):**
     - The question mentions that CozyDuke establishes persistence using methods like registry modifications or COM-object hijacking. This aligns with the T1546.015 technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):**
     - The related TTPs indicate that CozyDuke uses web protocols for C&C communication. This suggests that CozyDuke is more likely to use web-based protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) rather than Jabber/XMPP for C&C communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, CozyDuke is more likely to use web protocols for C&C communication rather than Jabber/XMPP. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
