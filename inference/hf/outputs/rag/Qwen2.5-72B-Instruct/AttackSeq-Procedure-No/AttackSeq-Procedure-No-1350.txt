### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the callCam app is likely to facilitate ARP cache poisoning during the Collection phase before exfiltrating data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique is listed under the Collection phase, which involves gathering data from the compromised device.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ARP Cache Poisoning in the Collection Phase:**
     - ARP cache poisoning is typically used to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it can be used during the Collection phase to gather data, it is more commonly associated with the Command and Control (C2) phase to maintain control over the compromised device or to facilitate data exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - Exfiltration over a C2 channel is a common technique used to send collected data to a C&C server. This is typically done after the data has been collected and processed.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The question suggests a sequence where ARP cache poisoning is used during the Collection phase, followed by exfiltration. However, ARP cache poisoning is more likely to be used to facilitate the exfiltration process rather than as a primary collection method.
     - The related TTPs list ARP cache poisoning under both the Collection and Exfiltration phases, but the primary use case for ARP cache poisoning in the context of exfiltration is to intercept and manipulate network traffic to send data to the C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the typical use of ARP cache poisoning, it is more plausible that ARP cache poisoning would be used during the Exfiltration phase to facilitate the sending of data to the C&C server rather than during the Collection phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
