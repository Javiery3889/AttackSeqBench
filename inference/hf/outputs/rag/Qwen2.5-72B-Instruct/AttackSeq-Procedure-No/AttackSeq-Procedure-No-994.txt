### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives during the Collection phase.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data to a remote system without requiring additional interaction from the attacker.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the transfer of data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique suggests that the exfiltration process is automated, which means it can be set to occur at regular intervals.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique indicates that the data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communications, which is common in many malware operations to maintain stealth and efficiency.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The combination of T1020 and T1041 suggests that the exfiltration process is both automated and occurs over the C2 channel.
   - Automated exfiltration can be configured to occur at regular intervals, such as every 10 minutes, to ensure that the data is consistently and efficiently transferred to the attacker's server.
   - However, the frequency of exfiltration (every 10 minutes) is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. It is a plausible configuration, but it is not a standard or required interval for automated exfiltration.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - While automated exfiltration is a common and plausible technique, the specific interval of every 10 minutes is not a standard or required configuration. It is possible, but not necessarily the most likely scenario without additional context.

### Final Answer: B: No
