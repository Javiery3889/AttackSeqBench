### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.
   - The key points are:
     - Recipients are initially presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report.
     - They then receive spear phishing emails.
     - These emails contain links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750.
     - The goal is to deliver QuasarRAT.
     - The question specifically asks if this happens only after the recipients are already infected with QuasarRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a document reader) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - The initial access is typically the first step in an attack, where the attacker sends spear phishing emails to gain a foothold in the target's system.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - Once the initial access is gained, the attacker can use this technique to exploit a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code, such as delivering a payload like QuasarRAT.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The typical sequence would be:
       1. Initial Access: Recipients receive spear phishing emails with attachments.
       2. Exploitation: The attachments exploit a vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2017-8750) to execute code.
       3. Payload Delivery: The exploit delivers QuasarRAT.
   - **Question Context:**
     - The question asks if the spear phishing emails containing the RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 are sent only after the recipients are already infected with QuasarRAT.
     - This is unlikely because the spear phishing emails are typically the initial vector for infection, not a follow-up after infection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical attack sequence and the related TTPs, it is unlikely that recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Final Answer: B: No**
