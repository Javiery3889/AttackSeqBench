### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Earth Lusca is likely to schedule tasks for persistence only after executing a command that created a service disguised as a system update to launch a Cobalt Strike loader.
   - The key points are:
     - Privilege escalation techniques (UAC bypass, hijacking execution flow).
     - Creating a service disguised as a system update.
     - Scheduling tasks for persistence.
     - Launching a Cobalt Strike loader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control (UAC):** This technique is used to gain higher privileges on a system.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique is used to create scheduled tasks for persistence, ensuring that the malware runs at specific intervals or under certain conditions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1548.002):** Earth Lusca would likely use UAC bypass or similar techniques to gain higher privileges on the system. This is a common first step in many attack sequences.
   - **Creating a Service Disguised as a System Update:** After gaining higher privileges, the attacker might create a service that appears legitimate to avoid detection. This service could be used to launch the Cobalt Strike loader.
   - **Scheduling Tasks for Persistence (T1053.005):** Once the service is created and the Cobalt Strike loader is in place, the attacker would likely schedule tasks to ensure the persistence of the malware. This ensures that the malware runs even if the system is restarted.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (privilege escalation, creating a service, scheduling tasks) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks.
   - The creation of a service disguised as a system update and the scheduling of tasks for persistence are both techniques that would be used to maintain control over the compromised system.
