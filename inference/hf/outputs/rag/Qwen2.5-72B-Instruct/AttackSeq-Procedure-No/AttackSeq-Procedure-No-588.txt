### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Gholee malware will clear mailbox data to evade detection before establishing a secure command-and-control (C2) connection using an expired digital certificate.
   - The sequence of actions mentioned includes:
     - Execution of a concatenated PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
     - Clearing mailbox data to evade detection.
     - Establishing a secure C2 connection using an expired digital certificate.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique involves using a digital certificate to sign malicious code, which can help the malware evade detection by security software.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the legitimate Windows utility `Rundll32` to execute malicious code, which can also help evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution of the PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`:**
     - This aligns with the T1218.011-Rundll32 technique, which is a common method for executing malicious code in a way that evades detection.
   - **Clearing mailbox data to evade detection:**
     - This is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, clearing mailbox data could be a form of defense evasion, but it is not a standard technique listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Establishing a secure C2 connection using an expired digital certificate:**
     - This aligns with the T1553.002-Code Signing technique, where the malware might use an expired digital certificate to establish a C2 connection, which can still help in evading detection to some extent.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if the malware will clear mailbox data before establishing a C2 connection. The related TTPs do not mention clearing mailbox data, and it is not a standard technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The execution of the PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32` and the use of an expired digital certificate for C2 are both supported by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The related TTPs do not support the claim that the malware will clear mailbox data to evade detection before establishing a C2 connection. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware will not clear mailbox data.
