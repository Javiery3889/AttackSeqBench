### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use spear phishing to initially compromise victims before mapping the network and collecting passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.
   - The context is that the attackers have already used spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question states that the attackers have already used spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini. This indicates that the initial access has already been achieved.
   - The next steps in the attack sequence would typically involve further actions to establish a foothold, such as mapping the network and collecting credentials.
   - The related TTPs confirm that spearphishing is a common method for initial access, but they do not provide information about subsequent steps.
   - Given that the initial access has already been achieved, it is not necessary for the attackers to use spear phishing again to initially compromise victims. Instead, they would move on to the next stages of the attack, such as network mapping and credential collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers have already used spear phishing for initial access and will proceed to map the network and collect passwords.

**Final Answer: B: No**
