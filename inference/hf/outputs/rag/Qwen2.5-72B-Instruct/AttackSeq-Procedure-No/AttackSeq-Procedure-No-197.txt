### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. It then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement before mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using existing domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to escalate privileges within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1078.002-Domain Accounts technique, as the attackers might use the credentials obtained from the spearphishing to log into the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement. These tools are commonly used for lateral movement in Windows environments.
   - **Network Mapping and Password Collection:**
     - After gaining initial access and performing lateral movement, it is common for attackers to map the network and collect passwords to further their access and privileges.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The final step in the question involves obtaining domain administrator privileges. This aligns with the T1078.002-Domain Accounts technique under the Privilege Escalation tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, it is indeed likely that the attackers will use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement before mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
