### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Black Energy 2 is likely to mount and bind to the `/proc/` filepath, enable subsequent in-memory operations, remove on-disk artifacts, and evade defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1055.009-Proc Memory:** This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a running process, which can be used to execute code in the context of that process.
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection by security tools.
   - **T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique involves storing data in memory or other non-persistent locations to avoid leaving traces on the disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mounting and Binding to `/proc/` Filepath:**
     - The `/proc/` directory in Linux systems is a pseudo-filesystem that provides an interface to kernel data structures. Mounting and binding to this directory is not a common technique for malware to use, especially for in-memory operations. This is more likely to be used for system-level operations or to access process information.
   - **Enabling Subsequent In-Memory Operations:**
     - This aligns with the T1055.009-Proc Memory technique, which involves injecting code into the memory of a running process.
   - **Removing On-Disk Artifacts:**
     - This aligns with the T1027.011-Fileless Storage technique, which involves storing data in memory to avoid leaving traces on the disk.
   - **Evading Defenses by Encrypting Payload:**
     - This aligns with the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique, which involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Loading Plugins Directly onto the Infected Machine:**
     - This is a common technique for malware to extend its functionality by loading additional modules or plugins.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the techniques of enabling in-memory operations, removing on-disk artifacts, and evading defenses by encrypting the payload are all plausible and align with the related TTPs, the specific action of mounting and binding to the `/proc/` filepath is not a typical or necessary step for these operations.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question, which includes mounting and binding to the `/proc/` filepath, is less likely to be the exact sequence used by Black Energy 2.
