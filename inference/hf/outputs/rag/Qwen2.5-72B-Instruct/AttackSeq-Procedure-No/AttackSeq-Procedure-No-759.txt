### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers, after verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for a 2-step verification code, will use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to trick victims into providing credentials.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves creating or acquiring email accounts to use in phishing campaigns.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves gathering information about the target to create more convincing spearphishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using images instead of text in phishing emails can be a tactic to evade detection by security systems, as many email filters and security systems are more adept at analyzing text content. However, this is not a common next step after verifying credentials and prompting for 2-step verification codes.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - After verifying credentials and prompting for 2-step verification codes, the attackers are likely to focus on using the obtained credentials to gain access to the victim's accounts or to perform further actions within the network. Switching to using images in phishing emails is not a typical next step in this sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a phishing campaign, the most plausible answer is that the attackers will not use images instead of text in phishing emails after verifying credentials and prompting for 2-step verification codes.

**Final Answer: B: No**
