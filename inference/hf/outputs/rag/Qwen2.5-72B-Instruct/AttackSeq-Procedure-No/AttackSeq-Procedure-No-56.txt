### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Lazarus (a known threat actor) ensures that web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to it, specifically in the context of conducting discovery activities like system network connections discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active network connections on a system, which can help the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This sub-technique involves determining whether a system has an active Internet connection, which can be crucial for exfiltration or for downloading additional tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If Lazarus ensures that web servers are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware, it would align with the T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery technique. Ensuring Internet access is a logical step before deploying tools or malware, as it allows for better control and communication with the compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If Lazarus does not ensure Internet access before copying tools or malware, it would be less strategic. Without Internet access, the attacker might face difficulties in controlling the compromised system or downloading additional tools.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs, it is logical for Lazarus to ensure that web servers are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware. This ensures that the attacker can maintain control and communication with the compromised system, which is crucial for further operations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
