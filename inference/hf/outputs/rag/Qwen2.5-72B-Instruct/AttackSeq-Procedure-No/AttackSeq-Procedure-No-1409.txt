### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to replace KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to ensure persistence only after using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump to escalate privileges, and then employ JSPRAT for local command execution and leverage BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process:** This technique involves modifying the authentication process to maintain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Escalation of Privileges:**
     - Tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump are commonly used for privilege escalation by extracting credentials and manipulating processes.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Replacing KeePass binaries with trojanized versions is a method of persistence, but it is not the only method. The related TTP (T1556-Modify Authentication Process) suggests that FIN13 might use other methods to ensure persistence, such as modifying the authentication process.
   - **Local Command Execution:**
     - JSPRAT is a tool that can be used for local command execution, which aligns with the T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell) and T1059.001 (PowerShell) techniques.
   - **HTTP-based Command Execution:**
     - BLUEAGAVE is a tool that can be used for HTTP-based command execution, which is a method of maintaining command and control (C2) over a compromised system.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Privilege escalation using Mimikatz and ProcDump.
     2. Ensuring persistence by replacing KeePass binaries with trojanized versions.
     3. Employing JSPRAT for local command execution.
     4. Leveraging BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution.
   - The related TTPs support the use of command execution and persistence techniques, but they do not specifically mention the use of trojanized KeePass binaries. The T1556 technique (Modify Authentication Process) suggests a different method of persistence.

### Final Answer
Given the related TTPs and the typical attack patterns, it is less likely that FIN13 would replace KeePass binaries with trojanized versions as the primary method of persistence. Instead, they might use other methods like modifying the authentication process.

Final Answer: B: No
