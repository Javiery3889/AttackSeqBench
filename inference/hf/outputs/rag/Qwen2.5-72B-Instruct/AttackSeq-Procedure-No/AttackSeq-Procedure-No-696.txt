### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gamaredon, after gaining initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures, is likely to use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the group uses scheduled tasks for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the group uses scheduled tasks for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The group gains initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Scheduled Task for Execution:** The group is known to use the `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute tasks. This aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique under the Execution tactic.
   - **Persistence via RUN Key:** The group is also known to achieve persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry. This is a common persistence technique.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Step 1: Initial Access:** The group gains initial access through the malicious document.
   - **Step 2: Execution:** The group uses the `at` command to schedule and execute a task. This is a logical next step to ensure that the malicious payload is executed.
   - **Step 3: Persistence:** The group then registers a RUN key in the Windows registry to ensure that the malicious payload persists across system reboots.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is likely that the group will use the `at` command to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
