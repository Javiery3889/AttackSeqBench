### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Konni APT Group is likely to exfiltrate the collected information to the C2 server using 'unactivate.vbs' before preparing the collected information for exfiltration as part of the data staging process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated tools to exfiltrate data.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a command and control (C2) server.
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration by moving it to a remote location.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Konni APT Group will exfiltrate the collected information to the C2 server using 'unactivate.vbs' before preparing the collected information for exfiltration.
     - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** supports the idea of exfiltrating data to a C2 server.
     - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging** supports the idea of preparing data for exfiltration.
     - However, the sequence described in the question implies that exfiltration happens before data staging, which is not typical. Usually, data is staged (prepared) before it is exfiltrated.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Konni APT Group will not exfiltrate the collected information to the C2 server using 'unactivate.vbs' before preparing the collected information for exfiltration.
     - This aligns better with the typical sequence of operations in cyber attacks, where data is usually staged (prepared) before it is exfiltrated.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of operations and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the Konni APT Group will not exfiltrate the collected information to the C2 server using 'unactivate.vbs' before preparing the collected information for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
