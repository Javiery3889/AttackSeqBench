### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Packrat is likely to collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites during the reconnaissance phase after using fake organizations in resource development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:** This technique involves collecting information about the physical locations of targets.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target:** This technique involves setting up a website or other online resource to attract and target specific individuals.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.001-Social Media:** This technique involves using social media to gather information about targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (T1608.004-Drive-by Target):** Packrat uses fake organizations to set up phishing sites to attract and target individuals. This is a common initial step in many cyber operations to gather potential victims.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations):** After setting up the phishing sites, it is plausible that Packrat would collect location information from visitors to these sites. This information can be used to refine their targeting and tailor their attacks more effectively.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1593.001-Social Media):** While social media can be used for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to collecting location information from visitors to phishing sites.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs. Packrat would likely use fake organizations to set up phishing sites (T1608.004-Drive-by Target) and then collect location information from visitors to these sites (T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations) as part of their reconnaissance phase.
