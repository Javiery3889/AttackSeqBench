### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an attack evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations, and that the attack was initiated by sending a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1036 - Masquerading**
     - **Description:** Adversaries may masquerade their malicious files and programs to blend in with legitimate files and programs. This can be done by using names that appear to be, or are often confused with, legitimate or benign files or programs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attack used legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection and was initiated by a benign-looking PDF attachment.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Masquerading (T1036):** This technique aligns with the use of legitimate tools and scripts to blend in with normal system activity, making it harder for security systems to detect the malicious activity.
       - **PDF Attachment:** Sending a PDF attachment that appears benign is a common initial attack vector. If the PDF contains a malicious payload or a link to a malicious site, it can bypass security filters and initiate the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attack did not use legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection or was not initiated by a benign-looking PDF attachment.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the provided TTPs, particularly T1036, which specifically mentions the use of masquerading to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attack used legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection and was initiated by a benign-looking PDF attachment.
   - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
