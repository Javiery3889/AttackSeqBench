### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug, after performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages, is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports only after collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which can help evade detection by network security systems.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the application layer, which can also help evade detection.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending stolen data back to the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration via Compressed and Encrypted TCP Messages:**
     - This aligns with T1041, as it involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
   - **Communication with C&C Servers Using a Custom TCP-Based Protocol Over Non-Standard Ports:**
     - This aligns with T1571 and T1095, as it involves using non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Collecting Metadata and Content from All Mapped Drives, Removable Media, and Network Shared Drives:**
     - This is a common step in the data exfiltration process, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a logical step that would typically occur before exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports **only after** collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - The related TTPs support the use of non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols for communication, but they do not explicitly state the sequence of events.
   - However, it is a common practice in malware to collect data before exfiltration, and the use of non-standard ports and protocols is a common method to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs and common malware behavior.
