### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Konni APT Group is likely to upload collected data to dedicated per-victim folders in Dropbox before exfiltrating it via a POST request.
   - The key points are:
     - Collection of information using `versioninfo.bat`.
     - Uploading to dedicated per-victim folders in Dropbox.
     - Exfiltration via a POST request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
   - This TTP indicates that the group uses cloud storage services, such as Dropbox, to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Konni APT Group uploads the collected data to dedicated per-victim folders in Dropbox before exfiltrating it via a POST request.
     - This aligns with the T1567.002 technique, which involves exfiltration to cloud storage.
     - It is plausible that the group would use dedicated folders to organize and manage the exfiltrated data, especially for multiple victims.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Konni APT Group does not upload the collected data to dedicated per-victim folders in Dropbox before exfiltrating it via a POST request.
     - This does not align with the T1567.002 technique, which specifically mentions exfiltration to cloud storage.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the plausibility of using dedicated folders for organization, the most plausible answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
