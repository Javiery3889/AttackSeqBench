### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
   - The sequence of events described is:
     1. FIN13 employs passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
     2. They establish a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution.
     3. They use other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
     4. They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using web shells to maintain persistence on a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Employing Passive Backdoors (BLUEAGAVE):**
     - BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server for listening to incoming requests and command execution. This aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.
   - **Step 2: Establishing Persistence (SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries):**
     - SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are tools used to establish persistence. This aligns with the T1505.003-Web Shell technique, as web shells are a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Step 3: Exploiting External Servers for Initial Access:**
     - The question suggests that FIN13 would exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after establishing persistence. However, this sequence is less likely because:
       - Initial access typically occurs before establishing persistence.
       - Deploying web shells and custom malware for initial access is a common early-stage tactic, not a post-persistence activity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. It is more likely that FIN13 would use web shells and custom malware for initial access before establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

**Final Answer: B: No**
