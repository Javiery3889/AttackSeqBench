### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will use a sequence of TTPs: first, distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing, and then compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the supply chain of software to deliver malicious payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):** This is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails with links to malicious content. The question mentions distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Compromise Software Supply Chain (T1195.002):** This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, such as legitimate software updates, to deliver malware. The question mentions compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor, which aligns with this technique.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves two distinct stages:
     1. **Initial Access via Spearphishing:** The attackers use spear-phishing emails to distribute malicious LNK files.
     2. **Supply Chain Compromise:** After gaining initial access, the attackers compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.

   - While both techniques are valid and can be used by APT groups, the sequence described is less common. Typically, APT groups use spear-phishing to gain initial access and then use various post-exploitation techniques to maintain persistence and achieve their objectives. Compromising the software supply chain is a more advanced and sophisticated technique that is not always used in conjunction with initial spear-phishing attacks.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is possible for an APT group to use both techniques, the sequence described in the question is not the most common or likely scenario. APT groups often use spear-phishing to gain initial access and then use other techniques to maintain persistence and achieve their goals, rather than immediately compromising the software supply chain.

### Final Answer:
B: No
