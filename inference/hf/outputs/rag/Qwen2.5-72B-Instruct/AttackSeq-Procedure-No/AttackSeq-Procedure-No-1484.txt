### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Duke group, after using Seaduke to securely communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server, is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
   - This TTP indicates that exfiltration can occur over the same channel used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.
     - Given the related TTP (T1041), this is a plausible scenario. The technique T1041 specifically mentions that data exfiltration can occur over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group will not exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP, which indicates that exfiltration over the C2 channel is a common technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP (T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), it is likely that the Duke group will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
