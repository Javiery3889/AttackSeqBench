### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Deliver a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
     2. Use a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') to download a zip file containing components for the malware payload.
     3. Decode and execute a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including downloading files, executing scripts, and interacting with the operating system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the content of the file or script readable and executable. This is often used to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file is a common method for achieving initial access. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **PowerShell Script ('fmx.ps1'):**
     - The use of a PowerShell script to download a zip file containing components for the malware payload is consistent with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique. PowerShell is often used to download and execute additional components.
   - **Decoding and Executing Base64 Encoded Script:**
     - The step of decoding and executing a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' aligns with the T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information technique. This is a common method to evade detection and ensure that the script is only executed after it has been decoded.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload and then decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
