### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a backdoor (SLUB) that supports various commands for data collection, such as taking screenshots, copying files, and creating archives of the user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will perform discovery by downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet to retrieve lines marked with specific patterns.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system and preparing it for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, such as files and other information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The backdoor is already performing data collection (T1074.001 and T1005), which aligns with the described activities of taking screenshots, copying files, and creating archives.
     - The next logical step in an attack sequence would be to perform discovery to identify additional files and directories that might be of interest (T1083).
     - Downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet to retrieve lines marked with specific patterns is a method of dynamic command and control, which is a common technique used by backdoors to receive instructions and perform further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor would not perform discovery by downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet.
     - However, given the backdoor's capabilities and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the backdoor would perform such discovery to gather more information and execute additional commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor would perform discovery by downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet to retrieve lines marked with specific patterns.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
