### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through a malicious document.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that contain malicious content. The goal is to trick the recipient into opening the attachment, which then leads to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. In this case, the vulnerability is CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access through Phishing:**
     - The campaign starts with spearphishing emails containing a malicious document ('Richard_Johnson.doc'). This aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Exploiting CVE-2018-13379:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will then exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves gaining initial access through phishing and then exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. This is a plausible sequence because once the attacker gains initial access through the phishing email, they can then move laterally within the network or target specific public-facing applications to further their attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the sequence of events described, it is plausible that the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
