### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS initially gained access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that PowerShell scripts were used to run a credential harvesting tool in memory instead of the Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1059.001-PowerShell, which is part of the Execution tactic. This technique involves adversaries using PowerShell to execute code on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Remote Control:**
     - The initial access was gained using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts. Shellcode is often used for remote control because it can be small and efficient, and it can be executed directly in memory without writing to disk, which helps evade detection.
   - **Credential Harvesting:**
     - Credential harvesting tools can be executed in memory using PowerShell scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including credential harvesting.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that after gaining initial access and setting up remote control, the attackers would use PowerShell scripts to run a credential harvesting tool in memory. This is because PowerShell scripts can be used to perform complex tasks and can be executed in memory to evade defenses.
     - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts were used for credential harvesting instead of the Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory. This implies a choice between using PowerShell for credential harvesting or continuing to use Shellcode for other functionalities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context, it is more likely that the attackers would use PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting in memory, as it aligns with the capabilities and stealth of PowerShell. However, the question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts were used instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory. Since the initial access and remote control were established using Shellcode, it is less likely that the attackers would switch to PowerShell for the core step of the attack.

**Final Answer: B: No**
