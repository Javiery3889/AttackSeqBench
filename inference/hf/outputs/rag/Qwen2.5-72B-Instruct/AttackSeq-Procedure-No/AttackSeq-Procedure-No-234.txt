### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will establish persistence using Microsoft Outlook add-ins instead of creating a scheduled task after the .lnk file delivers its payload and the PowerShell script obfuscates its execution in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that the malware is likely to use scheduled tasks to establish persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This further reinforces the use of scheduled tasks for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will use Microsoft Outlook add-ins for persistence.
     - However, the related TTPs specifically mention the use of scheduled tasks (T1053.005) for both persistence and execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not use Microsoft Outlook add-ins for persistence and will instead use scheduled tasks.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs, which emphasize the use of scheduled tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, it is more likely that the malware will use scheduled tasks for persistence rather than Microsoft Outlook add-ins.

**Final Answer: B: No**
