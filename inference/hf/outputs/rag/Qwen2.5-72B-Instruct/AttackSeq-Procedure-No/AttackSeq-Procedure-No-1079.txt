### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence only after gaining initial access through a malicious Microsoft Word document with encoded PowerShell scripts executed via macro-triggered events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files and information to execute them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with encoded PowerShell scripts executed via macro-triggered events. This aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell and T1027.010-Command Obfuscation techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The obfuscation of the backdoor payload is part of the defense evasion strategy, which is consistent with T1027.010-Command Obfuscation.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, the campaign uses decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence. This aligns with T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, as the encoded scripts are deobfuscated to execute the persistence mechanism.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The campaign uses obfuscation for initial access and then deobfuscates scripts to establish persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
