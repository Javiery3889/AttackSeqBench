### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will purchase credentials and session tokens from criminal underground forums after using active discovery methods for reconnaissance and before establishing a command and control (C2) connection through malware on the targeted network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data:** This technique involves adversaries purchasing technical data, which can include credentials and session tokens, from criminal forums.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.001-Malware:** This technique involves adversaries developing or acquiring malware to use in their operations.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves adversaries gathering credentials as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data):** This technique aligns with the idea of purchasing credentials and session tokens from criminal forums. This is a common method for adversaries to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):** This technique also supports the idea of gathering credentials, which can be done through various means, including purchasing them.
   - **Resource Development (T1588.001-Malware):** This technique involves developing or acquiring malware, which is typically used after gaining initial access to establish a C2 connection.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Active Discovery Methods for Reconnaissance:** This is the initial step where adversaries gather information about potential targets.
   - **Purchase Credentials and Session Tokens:** After gathering initial information, adversaries might purchase credentials and session tokens to gain access to the network.
   - **Establish C2 Connection through Malware:** Once access is gained, adversaries use malware to establish a C2 connection.

### Final Answer:
Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that adversaries will purchase credentials and session tokens from criminal underground forums after using active discovery methods for reconnaissance and before establishing a command and control connection through malware on the targeted network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
