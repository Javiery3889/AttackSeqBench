### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts only after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
     - The focus is on the sequence of TTPs, specifically whether gathering victim identity information happened after domain registration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which can be used for various purposes, including social engineering and further attacks.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website that the victim is likely to visit, often through a watering hole attack.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.002 - WHOIS:**
     - This technique involves using WHOIS services to gather information about domain registrations, which can be used to understand the victim's infrastructure and potentially for social engineering.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks (T1189).
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The question asks about the sequence of gathering victim identity information (T1589) and domain registration (T1596.002).
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Domain Registration (T1596.002):**
       - Registering domains with or without WHOIS protection is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to set up infrastructure for further attacks.
     - **Gathering Victim Identity Information (T1589):**
       - This step is also part of the reconnaissance phase and can be performed before or after domain registration, depending on the attacker's strategy.
     - **Logical Sequence:**
       - It is plausible that ProjectM actors would register domains first to set up their infrastructure and then gather victim identity information to refine their attack strategy.
       - However, the question specifically asks if the gathering of victim identity information happened **only** after domain registration, which implies a strict sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the specific phrasing of the question, it is more likely that the gathering of victim identity information could happen both before and after domain registration, depending on the attacker's needs and the specific attack scenario.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that they gathered victim identity information **only** after registering domains.

**Final Answer: B: No**
