### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SLUB malware will collect system information and capture screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server under the Discovery phase, after it has already exfiltrated system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which in this case is the Mattermost server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is a form of data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The malware has already exfiltrated system information and screenshots via the Mattermost server. This indicates that the malware has already performed the Collection and Exfiltration phases.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the system and network to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. This phase usually precedes the Collection and Exfiltration phases.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the malware has already exfiltrated data (Exfiltration phase) and is now asking if it will collect more data (Discovery phase). This sequence is not typical because the Discovery phase usually comes before the Collection and Exfiltration phases.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - While it is possible for malware to re-enter the Discovery phase after Exfiltration, it is less likely because the primary goal of the Discovery phase is to gather information to plan further actions, which has already been done in this case.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs and the context provided, it is less likely that the malware will re-enter the Discovery phase to collect system information and capture screenshots after it has already exfiltrated this data.

**Final Answer: B: No**
