### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 malware will create mutexes and named events to avoid detection only after achieving persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into explorer.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting a DLL into a running process to execute code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:**
     - This technique involves modifying the AppInit DLLs registry key to ensure that a malicious DLL is loaded by all user applications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of DLL injection in evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1546.010-AppInit DLLs):**
     - Modifying the AppInit DLLs registry key is a common method for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malware is loaded every time a user application starts.
   - **DLL Injection (T1055.001):**
     - Injecting the ResN32.dll library into explorer.exe is a method to execute code in the context of a trusted process, which can help in maintaining persistence and evading detection.
   - **Mutexes and Named Events:**
     - Creating mutexes and named events is a technique used to avoid multiple instances of the malware running simultaneously, which can help in avoiding detection. However, this is typically done early in the infection process to ensure that the malware runs smoothly and does not conflict with itself.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question suggests a specific sequence where the malware creates mutexes and named events only after achieving persistence and injecting the DLL. However, in typical malware behavior, creating mutexes and named events is often done early to ensure that the malware runs correctly and avoids conflicts.
   - The related TTPs indicate that DLL injection and persistence are crucial steps, but they do not specify the exact order in which these steps are performed relative to the creation of mutexes and named events.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware, it is more likely that T9000 would create mutexes and named events early in the infection process, rather than only after achieving persistence and injecting the DLL.

### Final Answer: B: No
