### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a backdoor program, after establishing communication with a C2 server using DNS tunneling, is likely to parse the returned data, extract commands, and then gather host information during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.004-DNS** (DNS Tunneling)
   - DNS tunneling is a technique where attackers use the DNS protocol to exfiltrate data or establish a covert communication channel with a C2 server. This technique is often used to bypass network security measures.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DNS Tunneling (T1071.004):** Once the backdoor establishes communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling, the next logical step is to parse the data returned from the C2 server. This data often contains commands that the backdoor needs to execute.
   - **Command Execution:** After parsing the data, the backdoor will extract the commands and execute them. One of the common commands is to gather host information, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The discovery phase involves gathering information about the host and the network to understand the environment and plan further actions. This is a crucial step in many attack sequences.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events described, it is highly likely that the backdoor will parse the returned data, extract commands, and then proceed to gather host information during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
