### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 (a known advanced persistent threat group) is likely to divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more, after collecting data using crafted modules like pr.dll and uploading stolen information to the C&C server, specifically targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a compromised system to a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:**
     - This technique involves setting limits on the size of data that can be transferred in a single exfiltration attempt to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will divide files if they are 16 MB or more.
     - Given the related TTP T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, it is plausible that APT28 would implement such a mechanism to avoid detection. Large file transfers can trigger network monitoring and anomaly detection systems, so dividing files into smaller chunks is a common tactic to evade these systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will not divide files if they are 16 MB or more.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, which indicates that APT28 is known to set limits on data transfer sizes to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of APT28, the most plausible answer is that APT28 will divide files if the size is 16 MB or more to avoid detection during exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
