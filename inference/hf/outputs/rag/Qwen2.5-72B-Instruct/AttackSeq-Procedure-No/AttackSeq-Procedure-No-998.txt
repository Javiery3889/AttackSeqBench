### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Using a zero-day exploit in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
     - Longhorn's tools abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
     - Performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with espionage-focused malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1528-Steal Application Access Token:**
     - This technique involves stealing OAuth access tokens, which can be used to gain access to applications and services, including email accounts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves using a zero-day exploit in a document (like a Word document) to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting emails from the local system, which is a form of data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - The question mentions using a zero-day exploit in a Word document to infect the target with Plexor malware. This aligns with T1189.
   - **Credential Access (T1528-Steal Application Access Token):**
     - The question mentions Longhorn's tools abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts. This aligns with T1528.
   - **Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection):**
     - The question does not explicitly mention collecting emails from the local system, but it does mention gaining access to email accounts, which is a step that could lead to email collection.

4. **System Fingerprinting and Discovery:**
   - The question mentions performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with espionage-focused malware. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and credential access, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, it is plausible that after gaining initial access with a zero-day exploit and using OAuth access tokens to gain access to email accounts, the attacker would perform system fingerprinting and discovery. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
