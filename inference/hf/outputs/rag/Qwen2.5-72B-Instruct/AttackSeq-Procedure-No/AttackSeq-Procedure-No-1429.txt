### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Smooth Operator is likely to perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the 3CX file `config.json` during its collection stage.
   - The key points are:
     - Collecting OS version from `SystemVersion.plist` during discovery.
     - Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers.
     - Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from `config.json` during the collection stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the adversary is gathering information about the system, such as the OS version, which is consistent with the first part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Smooth Operator performs HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from `config.json`.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Smooth Operator does not perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from `config.json`.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a sequence of actions:
     1. **Discovery Stage:**
        - Collecting OS version from `SystemVersion.plist`.
     2. **Communication Stage:**
        - Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers.
     3. **Collection Stage:**
        - Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from `config.json`.

   - The related TTP (T1082-System Information Discovery) only confirms the discovery stage but does not provide information about the communication or collection stages.
   - However, it is common for adversaries to establish communication with C2 servers after gathering initial system information to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks, it is plausible that Smooth Operator would perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers after the discovery stage and before the collection stage.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
