### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Using a spear phishing document to exploit CVE-2012-0158.
     - Dropping malicious components such as wab.exe and wab32res.dll.
     - Targeting the ASEAN region with a decoy document.
     - Suspected reconnaissance only afterwards.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending a spear phishing email with a link that, when clicked, leads to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending a spear phishing email with an attachment that, when opened, leads to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - This aligns with the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, which is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):**
     - This technique involves sending a link, but the question specifically mentions a spear phishing document, which is more aligned with T1566.001.
   - **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):**
     - This technique involves sending an attachment, which aligns with the spear phishing document mentioned in the question.
   - **Targeting the ASEAN region:**
     - The question mentions targeting the ASEAN region, but the related TTPs do not provide specific information about the target region.
   - **Decoy document for reconnaissance:**
     - The question mentions a decoy document used for reconnaissance, but the related TTPs do not provide specific information about the use of a decoy document or the purpose of reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Sending a spear phishing document (T1566.001).
     2. Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 (T1203).
     3. Dropping malicious components (wab.exe and wab32res.dll).
     4. Targeting the ASEAN region.
     5. Using a decoy document for reconnaissance.
   - The related TTPs support the first three steps but do not provide specific information about the target region or the use of a decoy document for reconnaissance.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the first three steps, but the question's additional details about the ASEAN region and the decoy document for reconnaissance are not supported by the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
