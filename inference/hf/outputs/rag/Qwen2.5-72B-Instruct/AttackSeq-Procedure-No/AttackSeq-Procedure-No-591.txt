### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the OilRig group involving a Trojan that communicates with a C2 server using HTTP requests and DNS tunneling.
   - It then asks if it is likely that OilRig will create a scheduled task named 'OfficeServicesStatus' to ensure the persistence of the ISMAgent payload before executing the ISMAgent payload via a VBScript.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to ensure that a payload (in this case, ISMAgent) is executed at regular intervals or at specific times, which is a common method for maintaining persistence on a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels (HTTP requests and DNS tunneling) to maintain control over the compromised system, ensuring that the C2 server can still communicate with the Trojan even if one channel is blocked.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP Requests and DNS Tunneling:**
     - The use of HTTP requests and DNS tunneling for C2 communication is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors like OilRig to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Creating a Scheduled Task:**
     - Creating a scheduled task named 'OfficeServicesStatus' to ensure the persistence of the ISMAgent payload is a plausible step. Scheduled tasks are a well-known method for maintaining persistence, and the name 'OfficeServicesStatus' could be used to blend in with legitimate system processes.
   - **Executing the ISMAgent Payload via VBScript:**
     - Executing the ISMAgent payload via a VBScript located at `%PUBLIC%\Libraries\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs` is also a plausible step. Using a VBScript to execute the payload can help evade detection and make the execution appear more legitimate.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common tactics used by OilRig, it is likely that they would create a scheduled task to ensure the persistence of the ISMAgent payload before executing it via a VBScript.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
