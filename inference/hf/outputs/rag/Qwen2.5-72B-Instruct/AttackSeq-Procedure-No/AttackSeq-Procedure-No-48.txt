### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group will collect password policy information after using the Responder tool to harvest credentials and before achieving lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers to bypass network segmentation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.004-LSA Secrets:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which is a method for credential harvesting.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1201-Password Policy Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information about the password policies in the target environment, which can help in understanding the strength and complexity of passwords.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves using compromised routers to bypass network segmentation, which is a method for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If the Lazarus group is using the Responder tool to harvest credentials, they are already in the credential access phase.
     - Collecting password policy information (T1201) is a discovery technique that can be performed to understand the target environment better.
     - After harvesting credentials and understanding the password policies, the group can then use WMIC and compromised routers to achieve lateral movement (T1599).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the Lazarus group does not collect password policy information before achieving lateral movement.
     - However, collecting password policy information is a common step in the attack lifecycle to ensure that the harvested credentials are valid and to plan further actions effectively.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, it is more plausible that the Lazarus group would collect password policy information before achieving lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
