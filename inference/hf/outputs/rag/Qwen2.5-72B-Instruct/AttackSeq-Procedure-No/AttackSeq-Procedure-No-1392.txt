### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager using the `enum_secrets` module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries using native OS binaries to gather information about the network configuration of a system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores**
     - This technique involves adversaries retrieving secrets from cloud-based secret management stores, such as AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries using native OS binaries to gather information about files and directories on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that FIN13 will first retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and then gather network and host configuration information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that FIN13 will not follow the sequence described in the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores** (Credential Access) is a technique that involves retrieving secrets from cloud-based stores. This is a logical first step for an attacker who needs credentials to perform further actions.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** (Discovery) and **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** (Discovery) are techniques that involve gathering information about the system and network. These are typically performed after obtaining necessary credentials to understand the environment better.
   - The sequence described in the question (retrieving secrets first, then gathering network and host configuration information) aligns with a logical attack flow where an attacker first obtains the necessary credentials and then uses them to gather more detailed information about the environment.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
