### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Seaduke, after establishing communication with its C&C server and maintaining control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption, is likely to retrieve detailed bot/system information and securely delete itself using a 'seppuku' function.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the malware uses web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This suggests that the communication is encoded, likely to obfuscate the data being transmitted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Seaduke is known for its sophisticated capabilities, including communication with C&C servers using HTTP/HTTPS and encoding/encryption. It is also known to gather detailed system information and has a 'seppuku' function to securely delete itself to avoid detection and forensic analysis.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Seaduke does not perform these actions, which contradicts known behaviors of the malware.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the known capabilities of Seaduke, it is highly likely that Seaduke will retrieve detailed bot/system information and securely delete itself using a 'seppuku' function after establishing communication with the C&C server and maintaining control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
