### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions performed by the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether the app will hide its icon and run in the background only after sending the gathered information (including process data) to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting information about running processes on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Discovery (T1057):**
     - The XAgent app collects a list of processes, which aligns with the Process Discovery technique.
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):**
     - After collecting the process data, the app sends the information to the C2 server, which aligns with the Automated Exfiltration technique.
   - **Hiding and Running in the Background:**
     - The question asks if the app will hide its icon and run in the background only after sending the data.
     - This behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a common tactic for malware to hide its presence and run in the background to avoid detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (collecting process data, sending it to the C2 server, and then hiding and running in the background) is plausible and aligns with common malware behavior.
   - However, the specific detail of hiding and running in the background only after sending the data is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The provided TTPs do not explicitly support the sequence where the app hides its icon and runs in the background only after sending the data. While it is a plausible behavior, the question's specific sequence is not directly confirmed by the given TTPs.
