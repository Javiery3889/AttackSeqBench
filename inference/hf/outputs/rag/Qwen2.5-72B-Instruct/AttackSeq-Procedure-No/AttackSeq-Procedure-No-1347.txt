### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the callCam app, after evading detection through overlay screens, will encrypt data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration to the C&C server before collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make it harder to detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Encryption and Exfiltration:**
     - The question mentions encrypting data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration. This aligns with the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique, which is used to evade detection by encrypting or encoding files.
   - **Collection of Files and Screenshots:**
     - The question also mentions collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices. This aligns with the T1560-Archive Collected Data technique, which involves compressing or archiving collected data.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question asks if the encryption happens before collecting files and screenshots. However, the related TTPs do not specify the exact sequence of these actions. Typically, in a well-designed attack, data is collected first and then encrypted for exfiltration to ensure that all necessary data is gathered before it is secured and sent to the C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is more likely that the callCam app will collect files and screenshots first and then encrypt the data for exfiltration. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
