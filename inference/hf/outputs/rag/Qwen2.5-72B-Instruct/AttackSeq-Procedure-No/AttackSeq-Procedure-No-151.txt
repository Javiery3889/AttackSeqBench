### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021:
     - Accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
     - Dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.
     - Performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB to access and control remote systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to aid in lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares):**
     - The question mentions accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer):**
     - The question mentions dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery):**
     - The question mentions performing reconnaissance and gathering output files, which aligns with this technique.

   - **Reconnaissance and Gathering Output Files:**
     - The question specifically mentions using SharpHound and PowerSploit, which are tools commonly used for reconnaissance and gathering information about the network and system.
     - SharpHound is used for BloodHound data collection, which helps in mapping the network and identifying potential lateral movement paths.
     - PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts for various tasks, including reconnaissance and privilege escalation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs and the common use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, it is likely that TG1021 performed these actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
