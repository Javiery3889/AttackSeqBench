### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will distribute malicious LNK files via spear-phishing only after executing a JavaScript file to perform specific actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, such as a document or executable, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the download and execution of malicious code.
   - **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying shortcuts (LNK files) to execute malicious code when the user opens the shortcut.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Higaisa APT group will distribute malicious LNK files via spear-phishing only after executing a JavaScript file to perform specific actions.
     - The related TTPs indicate that the group can use malicious files (T1204.002) and malicious links (T1204.001) to trick users. However, the question specifically mentions the sequence of actions involving a JavaScript file and subsequent actions.
     - The TTPs do not explicitly mention the sequence of executing a JavaScript file before distributing LNK files. While it is possible, it is not directly supported by the given TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Higaisa APT group will not distribute malicious LNK files via spear-phishing only after executing a JavaScript file to perform specific actions.
     - The related TTPs indicate that the group can use malicious files and links to trick users, and they can modify shortcuts (T1547.009) to execute malicious code. However, the specific sequence of actions involving a JavaScript file is not directly supported by the given TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, the sequence of actions involving a JavaScript file before distributing LNK files is not explicitly supported. Therefore, it is less likely that the Higaisa APT group will follow this specific sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
