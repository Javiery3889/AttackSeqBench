### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dexphot is likely to use CVE-2015-4902 to bypass security features after ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks.
   - The key points are:
     - Ensuring persistence using techniques like Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.
     - The potential use of CVE-2015-4902 for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves adversaries creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute their code at a specified time or in response to certain events.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using software vulnerabilities to bypass security features or gain elevated privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):**
     - Dexphot is known to use scheduled tasks to ensure persistence. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion):**
     - The question specifically mentions CVE-2015-4902, which is a vulnerability in the Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers. This vulnerability can be exploited to bypass security features, which aligns with the defense evasion tactic.
   - **Dexphot's Behavior:**
     - Dexphot is known for its sophisticated persistence mechanisms and defense evasion techniques. While it primarily uses techniques like scheduled tasks and signed binary proxy execution, it is also known to exploit vulnerabilities to maintain its presence and evade detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that Dexphot is known for using advanced techniques for persistence and defense evasion, and considering the related TTPs, it is plausible that Dexphot could use CVE-2015-4902 to bypass security features as part of its defense evasion tactics.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
