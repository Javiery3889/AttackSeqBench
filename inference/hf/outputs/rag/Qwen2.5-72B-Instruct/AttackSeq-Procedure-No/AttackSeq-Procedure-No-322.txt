### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the app will use encryption for its C2 (Command and Control) channel before uploading files via FTP protocol.
   - The app collects sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) and performs routines on the iOS device.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is typically a secure and encrypted communication channel used by the attacker to control the compromised device and exfiltrate data.
   - **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted, non-C2 protocol, such as FTP, HTTP, or other unsecured protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If the app uses a C2 channel, it is likely to use encryption to protect the data and commands being transmitted. This is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the app uses an unencrypted non-C2 protocol like FTP, it would be less secure and more likely to be detected. However, the related TTP T1048.003 specifically mentions exfiltration over an unencrypted non-C2 protocol, which suggests that the app might use FTP without encryption.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP T1048.003 explicitly mentions exfiltration over an unencrypted non-C2 protocol, which aligns with the FTP protocol mentioned in the question.
   - While using encryption is a best practice, the specific mention of T1048.003 suggests that the app might not use encryption for the FTP exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: No
