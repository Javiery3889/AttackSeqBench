### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gholee malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection only after the execution of the concatenated PE file `NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll` using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:**
     - This technique involves using the `Rundll32` utility to execute code from a DLL. This is a common method for evading detection because `Rundll32` is a legitimate system utility.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:**
     - This technique involves renaming system utilities to make them less recognizable to security software. This can help in evading detection by sandbox software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Gholee malware will employ obfuscation and evasion mechanisms only after the execution of the concatenated PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after the initial execution using `Rundll32`, the malware might employ additional evasion techniques such as renaming system utilities to hide from sandbox software.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gholee malware will not employ obfuscation and evasion mechanisms only after the execution of the concatenated PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware uses `Rundll32` for execution and may rename system utilities to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is that Gholee malware will indeed employ obfuscation and evasion mechanisms after the execution of the concatenated PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
