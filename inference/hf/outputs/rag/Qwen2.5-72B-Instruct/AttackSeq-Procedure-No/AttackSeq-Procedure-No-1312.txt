### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Shuckworm is likely to use the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel after communicating with C&C servers via HTTP requests, and then use downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols (Command and Control):** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling (Command and Control):** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the communication and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP Communication (T1071.001):** Shuckworm uses HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers. This is a common initial step in establishing a C2 channel.
   - **Protocol Tunneling (T1572):** After establishing initial communication, it is plausible that Shuckworm would use a tunneler like GOGETTER to create a more secure and less detectable C2 channel. The "Yamux" TLS-based channel is a specific implementation of protocol tunneling that provides encrypted communication.
   - **Maintaining Control with Downloaded Payloads:** Once the secure C2 channel is established, it is common for malware to download additional payloads to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. Shuckworm starts with HTTP communication (T1071.001), then uses a tunneler like GOGETTER to establish a secure C2 channel (T1572), and finally uses downloaded payloads to maintain control.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
