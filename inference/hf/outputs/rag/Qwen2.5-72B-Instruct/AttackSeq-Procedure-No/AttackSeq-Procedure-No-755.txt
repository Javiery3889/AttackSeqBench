### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant, after communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, is likely to have performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries collecting information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This sub-technique involves adversaries checking for an active internet connection, which can help them determine if the system is connected to the internet and can communicate with external servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves adversaries exfiltrating data from a victim's network using the same channel that was used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs suggest that after establishing C2 communication, the implant is likely to perform discovery techniques to gather information about the system and network. T1016 and T1016.001 are directly related to collecting network and system information, which aligns with the question's description of initial reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice would imply that the implant did not perform any initial reconnaissance after establishing C2 communication, which is less likely given the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is more plausible that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information after communicating with control servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
