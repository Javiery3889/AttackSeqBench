### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol, after establishing persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the malware uses scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This suggests that the malware uses a custom TCP-based protocol for command and control or data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This reinforces the use of scheduled tasks for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will remotely discover systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data.
     - The related TTPs do not explicitly mention network discovery (T1046-Network Service Scanning or T1018-Remote System Discovery), but they do mention persistence and a custom TCP-based protocol for command and control or data exfiltration.
     - It is plausible that after establishing persistence and setting up command and control, the malware might perform network discovery to identify potential targets for further exploitation or data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not remotely discover systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data.
     - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention network discovery, they do not rule it out either. The focus is on persistence and command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware would perform network discovery to identify potential targets before exfiltrating data. This aligns with common attack patterns where malware often explores the network to find valuable data or additional targets.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
