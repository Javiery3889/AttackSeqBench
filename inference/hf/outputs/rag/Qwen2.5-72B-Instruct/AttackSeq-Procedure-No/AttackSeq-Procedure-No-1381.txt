### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process:** This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique is specifically mentioned in the question and is a common method for obtaining credentials. It is a logical step for an attacker to take before moving on to other activities that require elevated privileges or specific credentials.
   - **System Service Discovery:** This is a technique used to gather information about services running on a system. It is often performed after gaining initial access and obtaining necessary credentials to understand the environment better.
   - **Trojanized KeePass Binaries:** This is another method for obtaining credentials, where the attacker modifies a legitimate KeePass binary to steal stored credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access to the network.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** The attacker uses WMI and custom web shells to move laterally within the network.
     3. **Credential Access:** The attacker uses techniques like LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials.
     4. **Information Gathering:** The attacker then uses the obtained credentials to gather information on services using system service discovery.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
