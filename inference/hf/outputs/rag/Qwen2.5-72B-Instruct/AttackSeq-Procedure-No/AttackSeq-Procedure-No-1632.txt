### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether an adversary is likely to divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from Microsoft SharePoint Online, which is a cloud-based service for file sharing and collaboration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:**
     - This technique involves setting limits on the size of data transferred to avoid detection. Adversaries may divide large files into smaller chunks to exfiltrate data more discreetly.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will divide files if they are 16 MB or more.
     - Given the T1030 technique, it is plausible that an adversary would divide large files to avoid detection. Large file transfers can trigger alerts and raise suspicion, so dividing files into smaller chunks can help evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will not divide files if they are 16 MB or more.
     - This is less likely given the T1030 technique, which specifically mentions setting data transfer size limits to avoid detection. Not dividing large files would increase the risk of detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the adversary will divide files if they are 16 MB or more to avoid detection during exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
