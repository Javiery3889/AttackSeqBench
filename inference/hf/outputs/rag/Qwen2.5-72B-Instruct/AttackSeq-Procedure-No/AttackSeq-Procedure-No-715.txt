### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gallmaker would use tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks only after initiating their attack by exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.
   - The key points are:
     - Living off the land (LotL) tactics.
     - Exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE protocol.
     - Scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks using WindowsRoamingToolsTask.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol in Microsoft Office to execute commands in memory.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique is listed again, emphasizing the importance of scheduled tasks in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE Protocol:**
     - This is the initial step where the attacker uses the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Living off the Land (LotL) Tactics:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker uses native system tools to evade detection and remove traces of their activity.
   - **Scheduling PowerShell Scripts and Tasks:**
     - Once the attacker has established a foothold and evaded detection, they might use scheduled tasks to maintain persistence and execute further commands.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker exploits the Microsoft Office DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.
     2. **Living off the Land:** The attacker uses LotL tactics to evade detection and remove tools from the victim machines.
     3. **Persistence and Execution:** The attacker then uses tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask to schedule PowerShell scripts and tasks, maintaining persistence and ensuring continued access.
