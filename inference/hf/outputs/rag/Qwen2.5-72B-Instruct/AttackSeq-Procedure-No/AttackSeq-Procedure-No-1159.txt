### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether other macOS malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) would likely employ their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access only after CrateDepression has dropped its payloads.
   - The key point is the timing: whether these other malware would wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads before they attempt to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can be used to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves checking user activity to determine the best time to execute malicious actions.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding payloads within other files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CrateDepression and Poseidon Payloads:**
     - CrateDepression drops Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal.' This is an execution technique (T1204.002) where the malicious file is used to gain initial access.
   - **Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis:**
     - These are other macOS malware that have their own mechanisms for gaining initial access. For example, Alchimist might use a different malicious file or exploit a vulnerability.
   - **Timing and Coordination:**
     - The question implies a coordinated effort where other malware would wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads before they act. However, in most real-world scenarios, different malware families operate independently and do not coordinate their actions.
     - The related TTPs suggest that each malware can independently use techniques like malicious files (T1204.002) and embedded payloads (T1027.009) to gain initial access and evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Each malware (CrateDepression, Alchimist, ChromeLoader, CloudMensis) has its own methods for gaining initial access. These methods are typically designed to be independent and do not rely on the actions of other malware.
   - **Coordination:**
     - There is no evidence or common practice in the cybersecurity field that suggests different malware families coordinate their initial access attempts based on the actions of another malware.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is more plausible that each malware would attempt to gain initial access independently, rather than waiting for another malware to drop its payloads.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
