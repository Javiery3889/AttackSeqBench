### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls only after gaining initial access by embedding malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access is gained via phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.
     - After gaining initial access, the macro downloads malicious payloads from the C2 infrastructure.
     - The question is about the likelihood of instructing victims to disable security controls at this stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that contain malicious code, which can be used to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through spearphishing emails with malicious MS Office documents (T1566.001).
   - **Execution:**
     - Once the user opens the malicious document, a macro is executed, which downloads additional payloads from the C2 infrastructure (T1204.002).
   - **Disabling Security Controls:**
     - Disabling security controls is typically a post-exploitation activity. It is more likely that the attacker would instruct the victim to disable security controls after gaining a foothold in the system and establishing a more persistent presence.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question (phishing email -> macro execution -> payload download -> disable security controls) is plausible, but the instruction to disable security controls is more likely to occur after the attacker has established a more secure and persistent presence on the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events and the typical post-exploitation activities, it is less likely that the victims would be instructed to disable security controls immediately after gaining initial access. The attacker would typically wait until they have a more secure foothold before taking such actions.

**Final Answer: B: No**
