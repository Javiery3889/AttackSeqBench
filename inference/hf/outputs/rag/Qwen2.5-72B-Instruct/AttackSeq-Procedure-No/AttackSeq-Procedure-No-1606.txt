### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access through malicious LNK files.
     - Delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
     - The focus on whether SideCopy captures mouse movements or performs API hooking before deploying njRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
     - This technique involves hooking into API functions to capture credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
     - This technique is also about hooking into API functions to capture credentials, but under the Collection tactic.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or mouse movements, to gather credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that SideCopy is not likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT.

   - **Evaluation:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that API hooking (T1056.004) and input capture (T1056) are techniques used for credential access and collection.
     - Given that the question mentions credential harvesting, it is plausible that SideCopy would use these techniques to gather credentials before deploying njRAT.
     - Capturing mouse movements (input capture) and API hooking are both methods to gather credentials, which aligns with the goal of credential harvesting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is likely that SideCopy would perform API hooking or capture mouse movements before deploying njRAT for credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
