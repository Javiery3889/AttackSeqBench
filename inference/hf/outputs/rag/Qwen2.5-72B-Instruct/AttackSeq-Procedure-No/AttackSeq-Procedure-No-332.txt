### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Derusbi malware, after gathering system information and beaconing it to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via port 443, is likely to use Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for its C2 interactions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.006-Web Services:**
     - This technique involves the use of web services to facilitate C2 communications. Web services can include APIs, webhooks, and other web-based protocols.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves the use of bidirectional communication channels to maintain control over the compromised system. This can include HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocols that allow for both sending and receiving data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port 443:**
     - Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, which is a secure and widely used protocol. Malware often uses this port to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Web Services (T1583.006):**
     - The use of web services for C2 communications aligns with the use of port 443, as HTTPS is a web service.
   - **Bidirectional Communication (T1102.002):**
     - This technique supports the idea of using a protocol that allows for both sending and receiving data, which is consistent with HTTPS.
   - **Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive:**
     - These services are cloud storage solutions that can be used for C2 communications. However, they are not typically used for real-time, bidirectional communication. They are more often used for data exfiltration or as a means to store and retrieve configuration files or other data.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given that the malware is using port 443 and the related TTPs suggest the use of web services and bidirectional communication, it is more likely that the malware is using a web service like HTTPS for its C2 interactions rather than cloud storage services like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the Derusbi malware is not likely to use Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for its C2 interactions.

**Final Answer: B: No**
