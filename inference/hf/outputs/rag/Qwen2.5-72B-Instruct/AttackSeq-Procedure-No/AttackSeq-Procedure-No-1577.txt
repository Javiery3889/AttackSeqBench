### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Earth Lusca engaged in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing before using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems that can be targeted for further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations to understand the network topology.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services):** This technique is typically used after the attacker has gained initial access to a system and is looking to move laterally within the network.
   - **Discovery (T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1046-Network Service Discovery):** These techniques are used to gather information about the network and identify potential targets for lateral movement. They are usually performed before or during the lateral movement phase to ensure the attacker has a clear understanding of the network topology and available services.

   - The question suggests that Earth Lusca used internal spear phishing before using discovery tools. However, internal spear phishing is typically used to gain initial access to a network, not for lateral movement. Once initial access is gained, the attacker would then use discovery tools to understand the network and identify targets for lateral movement.

   - The sequence described in the question (lateral movement, internal spear phishing, then discovery) is not the typical order of operations. Normally, the sequence would be:
     1. Initial Access (e.g., spear phishing)
     2. Discovery (e.g., using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan)
     3. Lateral Movement (e.g., exploiting remote services)

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of operations in a cyber attack, the described sequence in the question is not likely.

**Final Answer: B: No**
