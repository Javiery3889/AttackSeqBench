### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to stage archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server after using WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - Lateral movement using WMI and BUSTEDPIPE.
     - Staging archives of collected data on the OWA server.
     - The purpose is to aid in fraudulent transactions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves moving collected data to a central location or staging area before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting email data from local email clients.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - FIN13 uses WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. This is a common tactic to spread across a network and gain access to multiple systems.
   - **Data Staging:**
     - The technique T1074.002 (Remote Data Staging) suggests that FIN13 might stage collected data in a central location before exfiltration. This is a logical step to ensure that all collected data is organized and ready for exfiltration.
   - **OWA Server:**
     - The OWA server is a potential central location for staging data, especially if the attackers are targeting email data. Using the OWA server for staging can help in organizing and preparing the data for exfiltration.
   - **Fraudulent Transactions:**
     - Staging data on the OWA server can aid in fraudulent transactions by providing a centralized and accessible location for the collected data, making it easier to use the data for further malicious activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that FIN13 would stage archives of collected data on the OWA server after lateral movement and before targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
