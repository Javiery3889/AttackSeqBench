### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees during Credential Access using njRAT only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a target network to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering information about credentials, specifically targeting credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files:** This technique involves accessing credentials stored in files on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration):** This technique is relevant to the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases. It suggests that the attacker is using automated methods to transfer data out of the target network.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):** This technique is relevant to the initial gathering of information about credentials, which could be a precursor to the credential access phase.
   - **Credential Access (T1552.001-Credentials In Files):** This technique is relevant to the actual access of credentials stored in files, which aligns with the use of njRAT to target access credentials from Indian government employees.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases (Exfiltration).
     2. Using njRAT to target access credentials from Indian government employees (Credential Access).

   - The related TTPs support the idea that the attacker would first exfiltrate the authentication databases (Exfiltration) and then use njRAT to access credentials (Credential Access).

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because it follows a logical progression of TTPs. The exfiltration of authentication databases (Exfiltration) would provide the attacker with valuable information that could be used to target specific credentials (Credential Access).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
