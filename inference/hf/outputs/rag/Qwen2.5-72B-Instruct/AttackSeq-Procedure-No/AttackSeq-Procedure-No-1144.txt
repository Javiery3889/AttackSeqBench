### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that AdFind will be used to gather information about organizational units (OUs) and domain trusts from Active Directory after identifying potential entry points using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves identifying trust relationships between domains, which is also part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves using tools to scan for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities, which is part of the Reconnaissance tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys are used to identify potential entry points and vulnerabilities in the network. This aligns with the T1595-Active Scanning technique.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Once the attacker has gained access to the network, they would likely move to the Discovery phase to gather more detailed information about the internal network.
     - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique would help the attacker identify active systems and their roles within the network.
     - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique would help the attacker understand the trust relationships between different domains, which is crucial for lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - **Use of AdFind:**
     - AdFind is a command-line tool used to query Active Directory for various information, including OUs and domain trusts. This tool is commonly used in the Discovery phase to gather detailed information about the Active Directory structure.
     - Given that the attacker has already identified potential entry points and is likely to move to the Discovery phase, using AdFind to gather information about OUs and domain trusts is a logical next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that AdFind will be used to gather information about organizational units (OUs) and domain trusts from Active Directory after the initial reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
