### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process only after downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document, following the use of a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain elevated privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1220-XSL Script Processing**: This technique involves using XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) scripts to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This is a repeat of the first TTP, emphasizing the importance of UAC bypass in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **UAC Bypass (T1548.002)**: The question mentions using a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges. This aligns with the T1548.002 technique.
   - **XSL Script Processing (T1220)**: The question does not mention XSL scripts, but it does mention a script embedded in a malicious document. This could be a form of script processing, but it is not specifically XSL.
   - **Batch Files and CAB File Download**: The question describes a multi-step process involving batch files and downloading a base64-encoded CAB file. This is a specific and detailed sequence that is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs focus on UAC bypass and script processing, but they do not provide specific details about the multi-step process involving batch files and CAB file downloads.
   - While UAC bypass and script processing are common in malware infections, the specific sequence described in the question (batch files and CAB file download) is not directly supported by the given TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
