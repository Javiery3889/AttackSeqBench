### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers gained initial access through opportunistic phishing emails, escalated privileges, and then created backdoors on compromised systems, including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing within an already compromised network to move laterally.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves gaining initial access to a network by sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through opportunistic phishing emails. The related TTP T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment aligns with this part of the sequence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question states that the attackers escalated privileges by leveraging control weaknesses in the Windows network. This is a common step after gaining initial access.
   - **Backdoor Creation:**
     - The question mentions creating backdoors on compromised systems. This is a typical next step after privilege escalation to maintain persistent access.
   - **Installation of 'Mipko' Employee Monitor Tool:**
     - The question specifies the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool. This tool can be used for monitoring and exfiltrating data, which is a common post-exploitation activity.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (initial access through phishing, privilege escalation, and backdoor creation) is a common attack pattern and aligns with the related TTPs provided.
   - The installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool fits into the post-exploitation phase, which is a logical next step after gaining and maintaining access.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
