### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is achieved through watering hole tactics exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - The question asks whether attackers will execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation only before using the PowerShell loader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers use watering hole tactics and exploit CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Execution of Custom Shellcode:**
     - After gaining initial access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader. This step is typically part of the execution phase, not directly related to privilege escalation.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question asks if the attackers will execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation only before using the PowerShell loader.
     - The T1068 technique (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) suggests that privilege escalation is a separate step that can be performed to gain higher-level privileges.
     - However, the question implies a specific sequence where privilege escalation is done only before using the PowerShell loader, which is not a typical or necessary sequence in many attack scenarios.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While privilege escalation (T1068) is a common technique used by attackers, it is not always performed immediately after gaining initial access and before executing other payloads like a PowerShell loader.
   - The sequence described in the question (executing backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation only before using the PowerShell loader) is not a standard or necessary sequence in most attack scenarios.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attackers will not necessarily execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation only before using the PowerShell loader.

### Final Answer: B: No
