### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Stuxnet, after communicating with its C&C servers using encrypted channels, is likely to exploit the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stuxnet's Behavior:**
     - Stuxnet is known for its sophisticated and targeted nature, often using multiple vulnerabilities to achieve its goals.
     - It has been documented that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability for lateral movement.
     - The MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability is also a known method for lateral movement, although it was discovered and patched after Stuxnet's initial deployment.
   - **Relevance of TTPs:**
     - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique aligns with the use of vulnerabilities like MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler for lateral movement.
     - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique is relevant as Stuxnet would likely transfer additional tools or payloads to compromised systems to further its objectives.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that Stuxnet is known to use the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability for lateral movement and the related TTPs support the use of such vulnerabilities, it is plausible that Stuxnet would exploit these vulnerabilities after communicating with its C&C servers.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
