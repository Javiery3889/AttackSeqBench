### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques (e.g., multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine a command and control port) after collecting and archiving sensitive data before exfiltrating it over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.003-DNS Calculation:** This technique involves using DNS Calculation to determine command and control (C2) ports.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating the data.
     - The related TTPs include T1568.003-DNS Calculation, which is a command and control technique. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of actions after data collection and archiving.
     - DNS Calculation is typically used to establish or maintain command and control communication, not necessarily as a step in the exfiltration process itself.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 is not likely to use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating the data.
     - The related TTPs T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel are more directly related to the exfiltration process.
     - The sequence described in the question (collecting, archiving, and then exfiltrating) aligns more closely with these exfiltration techniques rather than the DNS Calculation technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN13 would not use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

**Final Answer: B: No**
