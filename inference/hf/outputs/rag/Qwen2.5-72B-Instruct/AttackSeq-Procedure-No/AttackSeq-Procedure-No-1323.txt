### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Sayad is likely to collect system information from the compromised host only after gaining persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using `rundll32.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information from web browsers, which aligns with the initial part of the question where Sayad gathers data from browsers.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying the registry to ensure that the malware runs at startup, which aligns with the persistence mechanism mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Discovery (T1217):** The question states that Sayad gathers data from browsers, messengers, and other applications to discover the compromised environment. This is a typical first step in an attack to understand the environment and identify valuable data.
   - **Persistence (T1547.001):** The question then asks if Sayad will collect system information only after gaining persistence. However, the sequence of TTPs suggests that the initial discovery (T1217) happens before persistence (T1547.001).
   - **System Information Collection:** Collecting system information is often a part of the initial discovery phase to understand the environment better. It is not typically done only after gaining persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks, it is more likely that Sayad will collect system information during the initial discovery phase, not only after gaining persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
