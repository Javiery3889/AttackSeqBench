### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Inception attackers after exploiting the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882.
   - The sequence includes gaining initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word, creating a scheduled task for persistence, and then deploying a PowerShell backdoor called POWERSHOWER.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to ensure that the attacker's code runs at specific intervals, providing persistence on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word. This aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question asks if the attackers are likely to create a scheduled task for persistence. The T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique is directly relevant to this step.
   - **Deployment of PowerShell Backdoor:**
     - The question mentions deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER. While this is not explicitly listed in the related TTPs, it is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to establish persistence to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system. Creating a scheduled task is a well-known method for achieving this persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
