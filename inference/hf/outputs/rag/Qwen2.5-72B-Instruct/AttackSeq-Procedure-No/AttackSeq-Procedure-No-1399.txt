### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control (C2) only after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Exfiltration of data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.
     - Use of proxies for C2.
     - Collection of sensitive data from network shared drives.
     - Archiving the collected data locally or remotely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves moving collected data to a remote system for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include network shared drives.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over alternative protocols, such as web services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - The question mentions exfiltration over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools, which aligns with T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol).
   - **Collection of Sensitive Data:**
     - The question also mentions collecting sensitive data from network shared drives, which aligns with T1005 (Data from Local System) and T1074.002 (Remote Data Staging).
   - **Use of Proxies for C2:**
     - The question asks if proxies are used for C2 only after collecting and archiving the data. However, the related TTPs do not explicitly mention the use of proxies for C2. The use of proxies for C2 is a common technique but is not specifically mentioned in the provided TTPs.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (collecting data, archiving it, and then using proxies for C2) is logical but not explicitly supported by the provided TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the provided TTPs, the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible but not definitively supported. The TTPs focus on data collection and exfiltration but do not explicitly mention the use of proxies for C2 only after these actions.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
