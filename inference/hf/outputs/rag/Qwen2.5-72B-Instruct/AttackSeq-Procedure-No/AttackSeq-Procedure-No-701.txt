### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Moafee and DragonOK after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.
   - Specifically, it asks if they will use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development only after using environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This confirms that spear-phishing emails are used to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This indicates that malware, such as custom-built backdoors and RATs, is used during the resource development phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing):** The use of spear-phishing emails to gain initial access is a common and well-documented technique.
   - **Resource Development (T1587.001-Malware):** The use of custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development is also a common technique to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - **Environment-Based Evasion Techniques:** While environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks are used to avoid detection and ensure the payload runs in a safe environment, the question specifically asks if these techniques are used **only** before deploying custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - It is plausible that Moafee and DragonOK would use environment-based evasion techniques to ensure their payloads run in a safe environment before deploying custom-built backdoors and RATs.
   - However, the question asks if they will use these evasion techniques **only** before deploying the backdoors and RATs. This implies a strict sequence where evasion techniques are a prerequisite for deploying the malware.
   - In practice, attackers may use a combination of techniques at different stages of the attack, and the sequence is not always strictly linear. Evasion techniques can be used at multiple points in the attack lifecycle, not just before deploying backdoors and RATs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the complexity and flexibility of attack sequences, it is not strictly accurate to say that environment-based evasion techniques are used **only** before deploying custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development.

### Final Answer: B: No
