### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a campaign will use T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion only before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction, after stealing stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to evade detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry (T1003, T1056):** These techniques are used to steal stored passwords and access tokens. This is typically done to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network.
   - **File Deletion (T1070.004):** This technique is used to remove files that could be used to trace the attacker's actions, such as log files or temporary files.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** This technique involves using a vulnerability in a client application to execute code. CVE-2017-11882 is a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute code without user interaction.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry:** The attacker steals stored passwords and access tokens.
     2. **File Deletion (T1070.004):** The attacker deletes files to evade detection.
     3. **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The attacker exploits CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently.

   - **Likelihood:**
     - It is plausible that an attacker would use file deletion (T1070.004) to remove traces of their actions before exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2017-11882. This is a common practice in defense evasion to avoid detection and analysis.
     - However, the question specifically asks if file deletion is used **only** before exploiting CVE-2017-11882. This implies that file deletion is a one-time action before the exploitation, which is not necessarily the case. File deletion can be used at multiple points in the attack lifecycle to cover tracks.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is more likely that file deletion would be used multiple times throughout the attack, not just before exploiting CVE-2017-11882.

### Final Answer: B: No
