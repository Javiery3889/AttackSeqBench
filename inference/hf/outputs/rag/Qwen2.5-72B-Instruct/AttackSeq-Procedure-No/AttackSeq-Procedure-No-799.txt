### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN4 will use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials and then label the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) macros to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that contain malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spearphishing with Embedded VBA Macros:**
     - The question mentions spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros. This aligns with the T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1059.005 (Visual Basic) techniques.
   - **Prompting for Outlook Credentials:**
     - The question also mentions prompting victims for Outlook credentials. This is a common tactic in spearphishing attacks, especially when the goal is to gain access to email accounts.
   - **Labeling Stolen Credentials with Unique Campaign Codes:**
     - The question mentions labeling the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development. This is a plausible step in the attack lifecycle, as it helps the attackers track and manage their operations.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs support the use of spearphishing with embedded VBA macros (T1566.001 and T1059.005) and the initial access through spearphishing (T1566.002).
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known tactics of FIN4, which often use spearphishing to gain initial access and then use various techniques to exfiltrate and manage stolen credentials.
