### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the TAIDOOR loader, after decrypting and executing the RAT files in memory, will establish command and control (C2) by leveraging social networking sites and cloud platforms like Twitter, Dropbox, and Mediafire.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves the use of web services to communicate with a C2 server. It includes the use of social media, cloud storage, and other web services to send and receive data.
   - **T1102 - Web Service:** This technique involves the use of legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 infrastructure. This can include social media, cloud storage, and other web-based platforms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs (T1102.002 and T1102) clearly indicate that using web services, including social networking sites and cloud platforms, is a common method for establishing C2 communication.
     - TAIDOOR, being a sophisticated malware, is likely to use these methods to avoid detection and maintain a low profile.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that TAIDOOR does not use web services for C2, which contradicts the related TTPs and the common practices of advanced malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of advanced malware, it is likely that TAIDOOR will use social networking sites and cloud platforms for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
