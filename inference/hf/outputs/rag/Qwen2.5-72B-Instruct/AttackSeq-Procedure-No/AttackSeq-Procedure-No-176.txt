### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Whitefly will use malware to repeatedly check the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system before using tools to steal large volumes of sensitive information for collection.
   - The key points are:
     - Lateral movement using stolen credentials.
     - Checking the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is present.
     - Stealing large volumes of sensitive information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001 - Keylogging:**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002 - User Activity Based Checks:**
     - This technique involves monitoring user activity to determine if a real user is present, which can include checking the mouse cursor position.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Whitefly will use malware to check the mouse cursor position before stealing sensitive information.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The T1497.002 technique (User Activity Based Checks) directly supports the idea of checking the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is present.
       - This is a common tactic to avoid detection and ensure that the system is not being monitored by a real user before performing sensitive operations.
       - After lateral movement and gaining access to additional machines, it is plausible that Whitefly would use such checks to ensure the environment is safe before exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Whitefly will not use malware to check the mouse cursor position before stealing sensitive information.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the T1497.002 technique, which explicitly mentions user activity checks.
       - It is less likely that an advanced threat actor like Whitefly would skip such a crucial step in ensuring the stealth and success of their operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely answer is that Whitefly will use malware to check the mouse cursor position before stealing sensitive information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
