### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the delivery of KerrDown via malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Office document will create system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into templates used by applications to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is listed again, emphasizing the importance of DLL side-loading in the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique is used to execute malicious code by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one. This is consistent with the use of RAR archives to enable DLL side-loading.
   - **Template Injection (T1221):** This technique is used to inject malicious code into templates, which can be relevant to the use of malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros.
   - **Creating System Services:** The question mentions creating system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software. This is not directly related to the provided TTPs, which focus on persistence and defense evasion through DLL side-loading and template injection.
   - **Base64 Blobs:** The use of base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture is a plausible method for delivering and executing the payload, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs focus on persistence and defense evasion techniques, specifically DLL side-loading and template injection. These techniques are consistent with the initial delivery and execution of the malicious payload.
   - The creation of system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software is not directly supported by the provided TTPs and seems to be an additional step that is not typically part of the initial infection vector described.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
