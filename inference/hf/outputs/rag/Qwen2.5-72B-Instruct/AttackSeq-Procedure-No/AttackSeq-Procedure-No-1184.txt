### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Tildeb, after establishing communication with its C&C server or listening on a TCP socket, is likely to encrypt C2 data, convert it into a hexadecimal representation, and then encode it into base64 for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to network defenses. Common encoding methods include base64, hexadecimal, and others.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This is a broader technique that encompasses various methods of encoding data to obfuscate it during transmission.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Tildeb will indeed encrypt C2 data, convert it into a hexadecimal representation, and then encode it into base64.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Tildeb will not perform these steps.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Encryption and Encoding:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that data encoding is a common technique used in command and control communications to obfuscate data. Base64 encoding is a standard method mentioned in T1132.001.
   - **Hexadecimal Conversion:**
     - While hexadecimal conversion is a form of encoding, it is not as commonly used in C2 communications as base64. However, it is not explicitly ruled out.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (encrypt, convert to hexadecimal, encode to base64) is a plausible sequence for obfuscating data. Encrypting data first adds an additional layer of security, converting to hexadecimal can make the data less recognizable, and encoding to base64 ensures it can be transmitted over various protocols.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the plausibility of the sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that Tildeb might indeed follow this sequence of actions to secure and obfuscate its C2 communications.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
