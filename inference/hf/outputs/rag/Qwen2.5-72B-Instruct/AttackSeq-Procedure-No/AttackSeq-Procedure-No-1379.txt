### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers use Arabic language decoy documents in a phishing campaign to gain initial access. It then asks if it is likely that the Scote malware provided backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only after the initial access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to entice the victim to click, leading to initial access.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The question mentions that the attackers used Arabic language decoy documents as part of their phishing strategy. This aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique, which is used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - Once the victim clicks on the spearphishing link, the T1204.001-Malicious Link and T1204-User Execution techniques come into play, leading to the execution of the Scote malware.
   - **C2 Information Collection:**
     - The question asks if the Scote malware collected C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only after the initial access phase. This is a plausible sequence because once the malware is executed, it would need to establish a command and control (C2) channel to communicate with the attackers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events described and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Scote malware provided backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only after the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
