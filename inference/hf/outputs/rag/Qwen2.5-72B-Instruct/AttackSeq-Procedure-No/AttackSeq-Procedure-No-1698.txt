### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether adversaries are likely to use secondary C2 servers for communication after employing reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager and establishing connectivity to primary C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
   - **Technique: T1008 - Fallback Channels**
     - **Description:** Adversaries may use fallback or alternate communication channels if the primary channel is compromised or unavailable. This can include using secondary C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reflective Code Loading with Empire DLL Launcher:**
     - Reflective code loading is a technique used to load a DLL into memory without using the Windows loader, which can help evade detection by security software.
     - The Empire DLL Launcher stager is a tool used to deliver and execute payloads in memory, often used in post-exploitation activities.
   - **Establishing Connectivity to Primary C2 Servers:**
     - Once the payload is executed, the adversary typically establishes a connection to a primary C2 server to receive further commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Using Secondary C2 Servers:**
     - The related TTP T1008 (Fallback Channels) indicates that adversaries often have contingency plans in place to maintain control over compromised systems. This can include using secondary C2 servers if the primary server is detected or blocked.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the use of reflective code loading and the Empire DLL Launcher stager, it is clear that the adversaries are employing advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - The related TTP T1008 (Fallback Channels) strongly suggests that adversaries are likely to have secondary C2 servers in place to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system even if the primary C2 server is compromised or unavailable.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
