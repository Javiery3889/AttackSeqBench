### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     - Using a backdoor to list interesting files (such as Office documents) during discovery.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will capture passwords by prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window as part of data collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing user input through GUI elements, such as prompts or dialog boxes.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:**
     - This technique is specifically focused on capturing credentials through GUI elements.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying and listing files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Inserting Malicious Macros for Persistence:**
     - This is a common technique used to ensure the malware remains on the system after initial infection.
   - **Using a Backdoor for File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This aligns with the T1083 technique, where the malware lists interesting files, such as Office documents, to identify potential targets for exfiltration.
   - **Capturing Passwords via GUI Input Capture:**
     - The T1056.002 technique is relevant here, as it involves capturing user input through GUI elements, which can include prompts for credentials.
   - **Context of the "macOS needs to access System Settings" Prompt:**
     - This specific prompt is a GUI element that could be used to trick users into entering their credentials, which aligns with the T1056.002 technique.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining persistence and discovering interesting files, it is reasonable for the malware to attempt to capture credentials using a GUI prompt, especially one that mimics a legitimate system request.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, particularly the use of GUI input capture for credential access.
