### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether GreyEnergy will use a modular malware framework during resource development, with functionality defined by uploaded modules to targeted systems, after securing access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.001-Upload Malware:** This technique involves uploading malware to a target system, which can be part of a modular malware framework.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves the use of malware in resource development, which can include modular malware.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances:** This technique involves gathering information about network security appliances, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy will use a modular malware framework during resource development.
     - The related TTPs T1608.001 (Upload Malware) and T1587.001 (Malware) support the use of malware, which can be modular.
     - The sequence of securing access, performing reconnaissance, and then using modular malware aligns with the typical attack lifecycle.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy will not use a modular malware framework during resource development.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate the use of malware and the uploading of malware to target systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical attack lifecycle, the most plausible sequence is that GreyEnergy will use a modular malware framework during resource development.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
