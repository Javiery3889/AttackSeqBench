### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel, after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique describes the process where an adversary exfiltrates data from a victim network by sending it over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:**
     - These are initial steps in the attack sequence where the adversary gathers information about the system and captures the screen, which are common reconnaissance and data collection activities.
   - **Communication with C2 Server Over Non-Standard Port:**
     - Adversaries often use non-standard ports to avoid detection by network security systems that may be monitoring standard ports.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - According to T1041, once the adversary has established a C2 channel, they can use it to exfiltrate data. This aligns with the question's scenario where the data is exfiltrated through the same C2 channel.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (system information discovery, screen capture, communication with C2 server over a non-standard port, and exfiltration over the same C2 channel) is a plausible and common attack pattern.
   - The use of a non-standard port for C2 communication is a typical tactic to evade detection.
   - The exfiltration of data over the same C2 channel is consistent with the T1041 technique.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
