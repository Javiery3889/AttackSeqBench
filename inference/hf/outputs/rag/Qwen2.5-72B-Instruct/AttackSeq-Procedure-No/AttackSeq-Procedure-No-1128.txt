### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the NewsBeef group.
   - Initial access is gained through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic during the execution phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking users into opening a malicious file, such as a macro-enabled Office document, which can execute code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or scripts, such as PowerShell, within a document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The NewsBeef group gains initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents. This aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, the question asks if Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through DDE.
     - The T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange technique is relevant here, as it describes how DDE can be used to execute commands or scripts, such as PowerShell.
   - **Delivery of Malware:**
     - The question mentions the delivery of JHUHUGIT and Koadic. DDE can be used to execute PowerShell commands that download and execute these malware payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described TTPs with the related techniques, it is likely that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through DDE to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of the campaign's execution phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
