### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aurora malware, after communicating with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme, is likely to modify the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL and load the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves modifying the file name or location of a malicious file to match that of a legitimate file to evade detection.
   - **T1574.011 - Services Registry Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to achieve persistence.
   - **T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into a running process, such as svchost.exe, to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique directly aligns with the part of the question where the malware modifies the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL. This is a common method to make the malicious file appear legitimate and evade detection.
   - **T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique aligns with the part of the question where the malware loads the DLL into its own svchost.exe process. This is a common method to inject malicious code into a trusted process to evade detection.
   - **T1574.011 - Services Registry Permissions Weakness:** While this technique is related to persistence, it does not directly address the evasion techniques mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question involves the malware modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL (T1036.005) and loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process (T1055.001) to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
