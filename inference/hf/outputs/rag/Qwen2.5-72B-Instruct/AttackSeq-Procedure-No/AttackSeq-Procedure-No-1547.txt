### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Smoaler, after overwriting the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file, is likely to establish persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon only after executing its embedded payload by writing it to the %TEMP% folder and running it.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a registry key or placing a file in the startup folder to ensure the malware runs at system startup or user logon.
   - **T1547.007-Re-opened Applications:** This technique involves re-opening applications that were running before the system was shut down to maintain persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes various methods to ensure the malware runs at system boot or user logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Overwrite the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file:** This is a common technique to evade detection by making the file appear benign.
     2. **Write the embedded payload to the %TEMP% folder and run it:** This is a typical method for executing the malware in a temporary location to avoid detection.
     3. **Establish persistence using rundll32.exe:** This involves using rundll32.exe to load a DLL or execute a command at system startup or user logon.

   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The related TTPs suggest that Smoaler is likely to use registry run keys or the startup folder to ensure persistence. This aligns with the technique T1547.001.
     - Using rundll32.exe is a common method to achieve this, as it can be used to load a DLL or execute a command at startup.

   - **Order of Operations:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the payload is executed first (written to %TEMP% and run) before establishing persistence.
     - This is a logical sequence because the malware needs to be active and running to set up persistence mechanisms.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of operations, the most plausible answer is that Smoaler is likely to establish persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon only after executing its embedded payload by writing it to the %TEMP% folder and running it.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
