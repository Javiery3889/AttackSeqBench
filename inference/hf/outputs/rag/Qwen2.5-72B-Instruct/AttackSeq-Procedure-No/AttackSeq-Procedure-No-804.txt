### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN4 is likely to use a proxy server between victims and the C2 server during the command and control phase, instead of relying on Tor for anonymous communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of a proxy server to route traffic between the victim and the C2 server.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This sub-technique involves using multiple proxy servers to further obfuscate the traffic.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This sub-technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography to encrypt command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1090-Proxy and T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** These techniques suggest that FIN4 uses proxy servers to route traffic, which aligns with the question's focus on using a proxy server.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique is about encrypting communications, which is a common practice to protect data in transit but does not directly address the use of Tor or proxy servers.
   - **Tor vs. Proxy:** Tor is a well-known anonymization network, but it can be slower and more complex to manage compared to a proxy server. Proxy servers can provide a more direct and controllable method of communication, which is often preferred by sophisticated threat actors like FIN4.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs, particularly T1090-Proxy and T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy, it is more likely that FIN4 uses a proxy server for command and control communications rather than relying on Tor.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
