### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use a keylogger plugin to gather account credentials after using images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, instead of verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials (Reconnaissance):** This technique involves gathering credentials through reconnaissance methods.
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging (Credential Access):** This technique involves using keyloggers to capture user input, such as passwords.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link (Reconnaissance):** This technique involves sending targeted emails with links to trick victims into providing sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Images in Phishing Emails:**
     - The use of images instead of text in phishing emails is a common technique to evade detection by security systems, as images are less likely to be flagged by text-based filters.
   - **Keylogger Plugin:**
     - Keyloggers are effective for capturing credentials, but they require the victim to be using a compromised device. This method is more passive and can be less immediate.
   - **Real-Time Verification and 2-Step Verification Code:**
     - Verifying credentials in real-time and prompting for a 2-step verification code is a more active and immediate method. It allows attackers to quickly confirm the validity of the credentials and bypass additional security measures.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Phishing Emails with Images:**
     - The use of images in phishing emails is a sophisticated method to bypass initial security checks. However, it does not directly address the method of credential collection.
   - **Keylogger vs. Real-Time Verification:**
     - Keyloggers are useful for long-term credential collection but are less effective for immediate access to accounts, especially those with 2-step verification.
     - Real-time verification and prompting for 2-step verification codes allow attackers to quickly and effectively gain access to accounts, even if 2-step verification is enabled.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The attackers are more likely to use real-time verification and prompt for the 2-step verification code to quickly and effectively gain access to the accounts, rather than relying on a keylogger plugin.
