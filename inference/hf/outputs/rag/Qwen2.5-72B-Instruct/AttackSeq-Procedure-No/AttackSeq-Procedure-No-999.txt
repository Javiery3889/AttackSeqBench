### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Longhorn, after engaging in system fingerprinting and exfiltration, is likely to use its malware for system information discovery only after employing defense evasion techniques like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery**
   - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the malware is likely to gather information about the system it is running on, which is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Fingerprinting and Exfiltration:**
     - These activities are typically part of the collection phase, where the attacker gathers data from the target system and sends it back to the attacker's server.
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):**
     - This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and network configuration. This is often done to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - **Wipe-on-use:** This technique involves removing traces of the malware after it has been used to avoid detection.
     - **In-memory string de-obfuscation:** This technique involves decrypting or de-obfuscating strings in memory to avoid detection by static analysis tools.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Collection Phase:**
       - Longhorn engages in system fingerprinting and exfiltration to gather and send data.
     - **Defense Evasion:**
       - To avoid detection, Longhorn might use wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation.
     - **Discovery Phase:**
       - After ensuring that the initial collection and exfiltration are completed and the malware is less likely to be detected, Longhorn would then perform system information discovery to gather more detailed information about the system.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that Longhorn would use defense evasion techniques before or during the discovery phase to minimize the risk of detection. However, the question specifically asks if Longhorn performs system information discovery **only** after employing these techniques.
     - Given the nature of malware operations, it is more likely that defense evasion techniques are used throughout the attack, not just before the discovery phase.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that Longhorn uses defense evasion techniques throughout the attack, not just before the discovery phase. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
