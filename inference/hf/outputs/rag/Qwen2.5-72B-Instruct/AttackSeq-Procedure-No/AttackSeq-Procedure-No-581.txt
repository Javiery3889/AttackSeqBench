### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers have already conducted system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if the attackers are likely to perform credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz to read the memory of `lsass.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Credential Access** and the specific technique is **T1003.001 - LSASS Memory**.
   - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which is a common method used by tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Fingerprinting and Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - These initial steps are often used to gather information about the target environment, such as the operating system, network configuration, and domain structure. This information is crucial for planning further attacks.
   - **Credential Dumping:**
     - After gathering this information, attackers often move to the next phase of the attack, which is to gain access to credentials. One of the most effective ways to do this is by dumping credentials from the LSASS process.
     - The use of a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz to read the memory of `lsass.exe` is a well-known and effective method for credential dumping.
   - **T1003.001 - LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique aligns perfectly with the described action of using a PowerShell script to read the memory of `lsass.exe` to extract credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the initial reconnaissance activities and the specific TTP related to credential dumping from the LSASS process, it is highly likely that the attackers will perform this next step.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
