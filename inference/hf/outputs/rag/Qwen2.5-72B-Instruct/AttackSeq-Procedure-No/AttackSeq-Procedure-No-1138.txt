### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WINDSHIFT APT is likely to use publicly available tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials after conducting long-term monitoring via social media and benign emails during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This indicates that the APT group may use publicly available tools.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This suggests that the APT group is interested in gathering credentials during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This indicates that the APT group may use techniques to access credentials from the LSASS memory, which is a common use case for tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs suggest that WINDSHIFT APT is likely to use publicly available tools (T1588.002) and is interested in obtaining credentials (T1589.001). The technique T1003.001 (LSASS Memory) is a common method for credential access, and Mimikatz is a well-known tool for this purpose.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that WINDSHIFT APT does not use publicly available tools like Mimikatz for credential access, which contradicts the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of the attack, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will use publicly available tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials during the Credential Access phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
