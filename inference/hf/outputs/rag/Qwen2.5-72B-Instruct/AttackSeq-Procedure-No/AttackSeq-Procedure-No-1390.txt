### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use steganography to hide its C2 (Command and Control) communications after collecting and archiving data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions, and before exfiltrating it over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:** This indicates that steganography can be used to hide C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This indicates that data is collected and archived.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography:** This indicates that steganography can be used for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Collection and Archiving (T1560):** The question mentions that data is collected from network shared drives and archived for fraudulent transactions. This aligns with the T1560 technique.
   - **Steganography for C2 Communications (T1001.002 and T1027.003):** The question asks if steganography is used to hide C2 communications. Both T1001.002 and T1027.003 techniques indicate that steganography can be used for this purpose.
   - **Exfiltration over Web Services:** The question mentions exfiltration over web services using web shells and JSP tools. While this is not directly related to steganography, it is a common method for exfiltration and can be used in conjunction with steganography to further obfuscate the data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that steganography is a technique used for both C2 communications and defense evasion, and considering the context of the question, it is plausible that FIN13 would use steganography to hide its C2 communications before exfiltrating the data over web services.
