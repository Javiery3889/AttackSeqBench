### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will use a raw socket protocol (T1095) for Command and Control (C2) communication only before the Collection phase.
   - The Collection phase involves using scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not at the application layer, such as raw sockets, for C2 communication.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the victim's system, which is part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This is a common and often preferred method for C2 communication because it is less likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** Using raw sockets for C2 communication is less common and more likely to be detected by network security systems. It is typically used in scenarios where the attacker needs to bypass specific network restrictions or when other methods are not available.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This is a Discovery phase technique, which occurs before the Collection phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the use of raw socket protocol (T1095) for C2 communication only before the Collection phase.
   - The Collection phase involves using scripts to collect files, which is a separate and subsequent step.
   - Given that raw socket communication (T1095) is less common and more detectable, it is unlikely that BRONZE PRESIDENT would use this method exclusively before the Collection phase, especially when more common and less detectable methods like web protocols (T1071.001) are available.
