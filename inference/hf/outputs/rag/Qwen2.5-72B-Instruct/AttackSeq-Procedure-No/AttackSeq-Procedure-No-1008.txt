### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT29 is likely to send phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments to maintain persistence after gaining initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, typically Microsoft Office documents, to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access vs. Persistence:**
     - The related TTP (T1566.001) is specifically associated with the **Initial Access** tactic, not the **Persistence** tactic.
     - **Initial Access** is the phase where the attacker gains the first foothold in the target network.
     - **Persistence** is the phase where the attacker ensures they can maintain long-term access to the network.
   - **APT29's TTPs:**
     - APT29 (also known as Cozy Bear) is known for using sophisticated and targeted spearphishing campaigns to gain initial access.
     - However, once they have gained initial access, they typically use other techniques to maintain persistence, such as creating backdoors, modifying system configurations, or using legitimate credentials.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While APT29 does use spearphishing with malicious attachments for initial access, it is less likely that they would continue to use this method to maintain persistence. Instead, they would likely use more subtle and persistent methods to ensure they can maintain long-term access to the network.

### Final Answer: B: No
