### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the behavior of Seaduke after it retrieves detailed bot/system information and securely deletes itself using a 'seppuku' function.
   - Specifically, it asks whether Seaduke is likely to calculate the command-and-control (C2) port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.003-DNS Calculation:**
     - This technique involves using DNS to resolve C2 server addresses or ports dynamically.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving C2 server addresses or ports using various methods, including DNS, HTTP, or other protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that Seaduke uses a specific algorithm to calculate the C2 port based on the IP address.
     - The related TTPs do not specifically mention this exact method of calculating the C2 port. T1568.003 and T1568 are more general and involve dynamic resolution, which could include various methods but not necessarily the specific algorithm described.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Seaduke does not use the specific algorithm to calculate the C2 port.
     - The related TTPs suggest that Seaduke might use dynamic resolution methods, but they do not specify the exact algorithm described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs (T1568.003 and T1568) suggest that Seaduke might use dynamic methods to resolve C2 server addresses or ports, but they do not provide evidence that it specifically uses the algorithm described in the question.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that Seaduke does not use the specific algorithm to calculate the C2 port.

### Final Answer: B: No
