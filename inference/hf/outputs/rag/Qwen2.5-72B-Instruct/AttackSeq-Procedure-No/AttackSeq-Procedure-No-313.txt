### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Dragonfly group, after using self-deleting code (T1070-Indicator Removal) to remove traces of their presence, likely used the Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001) to move laterally among internal or external systems before focusing on Windows systems to gather system information (Discovery tactic).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using the Remote Desktop Protocol to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal):** The Dragonfly group used self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence. This is a common tactic to avoid detection by security systems and forensic analysis.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol):** After evading detection, it is plausible that the group would use RDP to move laterally within the network. RDP is a common method for remote access and can be used to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Discovery:** Once the group has moved laterally, they would likely focus on gathering system information to understand the environment and identify valuable targets. This aligns with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of the attack, it is likely that the Dragonfly group used RDP to move laterally after evading detection and before gathering system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
