### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Naikon APT group used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server after evading defenses and before using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:**
     - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses:**
     - The question mentions that the group evaded defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques. This suggests a sophisticated approach to avoid detection.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that the group likely used web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C&C communication (T1071.001). This is a common technique for maintaining stealth and blending in with normal traffic.
   - **Protocol Tunneling:**
     - The use of protocol tunneling (T1572) further supports the idea that the group is using sophisticated methods to avoid detection. This could involve encapsulating HTTP or TCP traffic within other protocols to make it harder to identify.
   - **Aria-body Backdoor:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor is used to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase. This is a logical next step after establishing C&C communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the Naikon APT group and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that they used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication before using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
