### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the BlueDelta campaign exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information only after collecting emails through the creation of a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Utilization of web protocols for Command and Control (C2) activities.
     - Exfiltration of specific data (session cookie, address book, database information).
     - Collection of emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves using web session cookies to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols for C2 activities.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting emails from a local email client or server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the exfiltration of the session cookie, address book, and database information occurred only after collecting emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter.
     - The related TTPs support the idea that the campaign used web session cookies (T1550.004) and mail protocols (T1071.003) for C2 activities.
     - The collection of emails (T1114.001) aligns with the use of a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter to collect emails.
     - The sequence of events described in the question (C2 activities, email collection, and then exfiltration) is plausible and consistent with the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the exfiltration of the session cookie, address book, and database information did not occur only after collecting emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter.
     - This choice does not align well with the related TTPs, as it implies a different sequence of events that is not supported by the provided TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the events described in the question.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
