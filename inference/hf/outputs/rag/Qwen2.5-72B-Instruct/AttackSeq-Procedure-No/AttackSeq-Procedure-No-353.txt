### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**
     - This technique indicates that PowerShell is used to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to download and execute additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Phase (Command and Control):**
     - The downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware. This is a common technique where malware is hidden within seemingly benign files to evade detection.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The question asks if PowerShell scripts will then download a Windows executable and a decoy document.
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute files. It is commonly used in malware campaigns to download additional payloads and to maintain persistence.
     - The use of a decoy document is a common tactic to distract the user and make the malware appear less suspicious. This is often seen in phishing campaigns where a legitimate-looking document is provided to the user while the malware is executed in the background.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the use of PowerShell in the execution phase and the common practice of downloading additional payloads and decoy documents, it is highly likely that PowerShell scripts will be used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
