### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that ProjectM actors would use OpenSSL to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files, and before the Andromeda Trojan delivers payloads from these servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to encrypt C2 traffic, which can help in evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection by security tools.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** The question states that ProjectM actors gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files, which aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography):** After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to secure their C2 communications to avoid detection. Using OpenSSL for asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) is a plausible step to encrypt C2 traffic.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File):** Encrypting or encoding files (T1027.013) is another common technique used to evade detection, which can be applied to the payloads delivered by the Andromeda Trojan.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is reasonable to assume that ProjectM actors would use OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic to maintain stealth and secure their communications. This aligns with the common practice of using encryption to evade detection and ensure the persistence of the attack.
