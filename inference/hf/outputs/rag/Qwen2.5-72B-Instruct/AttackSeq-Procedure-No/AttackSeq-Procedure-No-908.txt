### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Gamaredon group will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers after using an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's inbox, which can be used to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal email systems to send spearphishing emails to other targets within the network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This sub-technique specifically involves collecting email messages from the local email client on a compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the related TTPs, it is clear that the Gamaredon group has a history of using email collection techniques (T1114 and T1114.001) as part of their collection activities. After successfully using an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement (T1534), it is highly likely that they would continue to collect email messages from the accessed systems and servers to gather more information and maintain their presence in the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice suggests that the group would not attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers. However, this contradicts the related TTPs, which indicate that email collection is a common technique used by the group.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the Gamaredon group will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
