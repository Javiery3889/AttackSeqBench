### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WINDSHIFT APT uses fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and employs social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of reconnaissance.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1585.001-Social Media Accounts (Resource Development):** This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information and resources.
   - **T1586.001-Social Media Accounts (Resource Development):** This technique involves using social media accounts to establish and maintain a presence for resource development.
   - **T1593.001-Social Media (Reconnaissance):** This technique involves using social media to gather information about the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that WINDSHIFT APT is using social media for both resource development and reconnaissance.
   - The use of fake social media personas and mobile apps to gather information suggests a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to reconnaissance.
   - Accessing external victim-owned websites for target development is a logical next step in the reconnaissance process. After gathering initial information from social media, attackers often use this information to identify and access other relevant resources, such as external websites, to further develop their targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the comprehensive nature of the reconnaissance activities described and the logical progression from social media to external websites, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
