### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers, after acquiring infrastructure for command and control (C2) servers, initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique is relevant if the attackers are exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. However, the question specifically mentions spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question. It involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, which can exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific details provided in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to exploit CVE-2021-40444.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
