### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by CosmicDuke after achieving persistence.
   - Specifically, it asks if CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames only after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that CosmicDuke uses scheduled tasks to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task)**: This is the initial step where CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task to ensure it runs at regular intervals or upon certain triggers.
   - **Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer**: These are data collection techniques used to gather information from the victim's system.
   - **File Search and Targeting Non-English Filenames**: This is a discovery operation where the malware searches for specific files, possibly to exfiltrate or manipulate them.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Operations**:
     - **Persistence**: The first step is to ensure the malware remains on the system, which is achieved by creating a scheduled task.
     - **Data Collection**: After persistence, the malware typically collects data to understand the environment and gather sensitive information. This includes using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
     - **Discovery**: Once the malware has collected initial data, it may then proceed to search for specific files, including those with non-English filenames, to further its objectives.

   - **Logical Flow**:
     - It is logical for CosmicDuke to first ensure persistence and then collect initial data before performing more targeted discovery operations. This allows the malware to gather a broader understanding of the environment and identify valuable targets.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of operations and the typical behavior of malware, it is likely that CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames only after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
