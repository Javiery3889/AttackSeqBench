### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT42:
     - Conducting internal reconnaissance by accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information.
     - Using pass the hash for lateral movement.
     - Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victimâ€™s trusted relationships.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails to internal targets to gain access or move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:**
     - This technique involves using stolen password hashes to authenticate to other systems and move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites:**
     - This technique involves searching for information on victim-owned websites to gather intelligence for further attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The question mentions internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the T1594 technique (searching victim-owned websites) and the initial step of accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using pass the hash for lateral movement, which aligns with the T1550.002 technique.
   - **Spear-Phishing:**
     - The question mentions sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets, which aligns with the T1534 technique (internal spearphishing).

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Conduct internal reconnaissance.
     2. Use pass the hash for lateral movement.
     3. Send spear-phishing emails to additional targets.
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with the related TTPs:
     - **Reconnaissance (T1594) -> Lateral Movement (T1550.002) -> Lateral Movement (T1534)**
