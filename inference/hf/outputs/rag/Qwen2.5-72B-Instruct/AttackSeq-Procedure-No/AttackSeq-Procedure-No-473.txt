### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Infamous Chisel, after leveraging its Command and Control (C2) capabilities, is likely to perform discovery activities such as enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the netd component.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems that can be targeted for further exploitation.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active network connections on the system.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services running on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Infamous Chisel, after establishing C2 capabilities, is likely to perform discovery activities to understand the environment it has compromised. The related TTPs (T1018, T1049, T1046) all fall under the Discovery tactic, which aligns with the activities described in the question.
     - Enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network are typical discovery activities that an attacker would perform to gather information about the compromised system and its network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel would not perform discovery activities, which is less likely given the context of the question and the related TTPs. Discovery is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle to gather information for further exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the activities described in the question and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
