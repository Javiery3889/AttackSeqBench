### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to inject decrypted shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading for execution only after ensuring persistence via the Run registry key.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute it in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by running malicious code in the context of a legitimate process.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves adding a registry key or startup folder entry to ensure that a malicious program runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Step (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):**
     - APT10 is known to use the Run registry key to ensure that their malware persists across system reboots. This is a common and effective method for maintaining a foothold in the target system.
   - **DLL Side-Loading and Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001):**
     - DLL Side-Loading involves placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate application. Dynamic-link Library Injection involves injecting code into a running process.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question asks if the injection of shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading happens only after the persistence step.
     - APT10 is known to use a combination of techniques to achieve their goals. They might use persistence to ensure their malware runs at startup and then use DLL Side-Loading or Dynamic-link Library Injection to execute their payload in a stealthy manner.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that APT10 is known to use both persistence and code injection techniques, it is plausible that they would ensure persistence first to maintain a foothold and then use DLL Side-Loading or Dynamic-link Library Injection to execute their payload.
   - However, the question specifically asks if the injection happens **only** after the persistence step. This implies a strict sequence where the injection does not occur until after the persistence is established.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The injection of shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading is not necessarily restricted to occurring only after the persistence step. APT10 might use these techniques in a more flexible sequence to achieve their objectives.
