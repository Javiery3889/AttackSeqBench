### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails crafted to resemble trustworthy senders after performing a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that the adversaries will establish a C2 connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is plausible. The spearphishing link (T1566.002) is used to gain initial access, and the malicious link (T1204.001) can be used to execute the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, which would then establish a C2 connection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the adversaries will establish a C2 connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails.
     - This is less plausible because the related TTPs clearly indicate that spearphishing and malicious links are used in the attack sequence, which would naturally lead to the establishment of a C2 connection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the attack sequence described, the most plausible answer is that the adversaries will establish a C2 connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
