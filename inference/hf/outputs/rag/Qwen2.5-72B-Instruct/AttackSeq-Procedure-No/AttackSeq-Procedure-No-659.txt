### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will execute commands to discover system network configuration on a compromised server before using Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks to run commands on other systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to a remote system and execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of pass-the-hash in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the threat actors will first discover the system network configuration before proceeding with credential dumping and lateral movement.
     - Discovering the network configuration can help threat actors understand the network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the threat actors will not discover the system network configuration before proceeding with credential dumping and lateral movement.
     - Threat actors might prioritize credential dumping and lateral movement to quickly gain access to other systems, especially if they already have a general understanding of the network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - While discovering the network configuration can provide valuable information, it is not always a necessary step before credential dumping and lateral movement.
     - Threat actors often have a general understanding of the network from previous reconnaissance or from the initial compromise.
   - **Credential Dumping and Lateral Movement:**
     - Dumping credentials from LSASS memory (T1003.001) is a critical step in gaining additional credentials.
     - Using these credentials for pass-the-hash attacks (T1550.002) is a common technique for lateral movement.
     - The use of Impacket tools, such as atexec, for executing commands on other systems is a direct application of the pass-the-hash technique.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is more likely that threat actors will prioritize credential dumping and lateral movement over discovering the network configuration at this stage.

### Final Answer: B: No
