### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services before enumerating system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system to understand the system's structure and identify potential targets for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):** This technique suggests that the exfiltration of data is automated, which aligns with the question's mention of "automatically exfiltrate the collected files."
   - **File and Directory Discovery (T1083):** This technique is about discovering file and directory paths, which aligns with the question's mention of "enumerating system data directories."
   - The question also mentions "GPS information," which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs. However, the focus is on the sequence of actions: exfiltration followed by discovery.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves exfiltration (T1020) before discovery (T1083). This is a plausible sequence because:
     - **Exfiltration (T1020):** The attacker would likely want to exfiltrate the collected credentials first to ensure they are safely out of the compromised system.
     - **Discovery (T1083):** After exfiltration, the attacker would then proceed to discover more about the system to plan further actions or gather additional data.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical flow of actions, the most plausible answer is that Infamous Chisel is likely to exfiltrate the collected files before enumerating system data directories and GPS information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
