### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether LYCEUM, after gaining initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks and delivering DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments, would clear Linux or Mac system logs before utilizing DanBot for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.003-Password Spraying:** This technique involves attempting to log in to user accounts by guessing or using commonly used passwords.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, such as an Excel attachment, which then executes the malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Malware Delivery:**
     - LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - They then deliver DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
   - **Execution of Arbitrary Commands:**
     - Once the malware is delivered, it is used to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.
   - **Clearing System Logs:**
     - The question specifically asks about clearing Linux or Mac system logs.
     - The use of `cmd.exe` suggests that the primary target is a Windows system, not Linux or Mac.
     - Clearing system logs is a common post-exploitation technique to cover tracks, but it is typically done on the system where the attacker is operating, which in this case is likely a Windows system.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the primary target is a Windows system (as indicated by the use of `cmd.exe`), it is less likely that LYCEUM would focus on clearing Linux or Mac system logs.
   - Clearing logs on a different operating system (Linux or Mac) would not directly benefit the attacker's operations on the Windows system.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that LYCEUM would focus on covering their tracks on the Windows system where they are executing commands.
