### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.
   - The key points are:
     - Lateral movement using WMI.
     - Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.
     - Using native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using existing domain accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement using WMI:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a common technique used for lateral movement in Windows environments.
   - **Gaining Credentials via Memory Dumping LSASS:**
     - The related TTP T1003.001-LSASS Memory confirms that FIN13 is known to use this technique to obtain credentials.
   - **Using Native OS Binaries and Scripts for Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining credentials, it is common for attackers to use native OS binaries and scripts to gather information on user accounts and other internal network details.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (lateral movement, credential dumping, and then internal reconnaissance) is a logical and common attack pattern.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that FIN13 would use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
