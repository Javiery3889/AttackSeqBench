### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a PHP script gathers system profile information and stores it in a MySQL database during the discovery phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the C2 (Command and Control) MySQL database will retrieve encrypted commands for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering the system time from the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering system information such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The related TTPs (T1124 and T1082) are both part of the Discovery phase, where the adversary gathers information about the victim's system.
     - The question mentions that the PHP script gathers system profile information and stores it in a MySQL database, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - The question then asks about the likelihood of the C2 MySQL database retrieving encrypted commands for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.
     - The Command and Control phase involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system.
     - It is common for C2 servers to issue commands to compromised systems, and these commands can be encrypted to avoid detection.
     - Cryptocurrency mining is a common follow-on action that adversaries perform after gaining control of a system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the Discovery phase is complete and the adversary has gathered system information, it is plausible that the next step would be to issue commands for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.
   - The use of a C2 MySQL database to retrieve encrypted commands is a reasonable and common practice in advanced attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
