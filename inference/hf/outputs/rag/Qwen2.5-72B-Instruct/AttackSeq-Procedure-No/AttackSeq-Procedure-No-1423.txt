### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the spyware would leverage C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities **only** before querying the databases for credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the use of `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases for credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information from the browser, which can be a precursor to credential access but is not the same as leveraging C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the spyware uses C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities **only** before querying the databases for credentials.
     - This sequence is less likely because the primary goal of the spyware is to extract credentials, and the C2 server is typically used for communication and control after the initial compromise, not necessarily before the credential access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that the spyware does not use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities **only** before querying the databases for credentials.
     - This is more plausible because the spyware would likely use the C2 server for ongoing communication and control, and the credential access is a specific task that can be performed independently or as part of a broader attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
