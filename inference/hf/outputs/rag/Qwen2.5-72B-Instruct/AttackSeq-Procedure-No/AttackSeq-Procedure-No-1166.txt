### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that ProjectM will use WMI in scripts for remote execution and system surveys after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities, and before employing techniques to evade defense measures such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts on remote systems and to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments (like RTF and Excel files) to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains initial access to the target system by tricking users into opening malicious attachments.
   - **Execution (T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation):** After gaining initial access, the attacker can use WMI to execute commands and scripts on the compromised system. This can be used for remote execution and system surveys to gather more information about the network and other systems.
   - **Evasion (WHOIS Protection for Infrastructure):** This is a later step in the attack sequence, where the attacker might use techniques to hide their infrastructure and evade detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access through spearphishing with malicious attachments.
     2. **Execution and Reconnaissance:** The attacker uses WMI to execute scripts and gather information about the system and network.
     3. **Evasion:** The attacker then employs techniques to evade detection, such as WHOIS protection for their infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
