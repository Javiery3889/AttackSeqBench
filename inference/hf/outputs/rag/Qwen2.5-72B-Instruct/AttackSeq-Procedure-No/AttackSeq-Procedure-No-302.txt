### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the IEXPL0RE RAT, after recording keystrokes and exfiltrating data such as passwords, is likely to use blogs and WordPress for C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure instead of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves the use of a C2 channel to exfiltrate data. The C2 channel can be any communication method that the attacker uses to control the malware and receive data from the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Blogs and WordPress:**
     - Blogs and WordPress can be used for C2 infrastructure, but they are less common and more easily detectable compared to encrypted HTTP methods. They are often used for initial communication or as a fallback mechanism.
   - **Encrypted HTTP POST and GET Methods:**
     - Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are more common and provide better security and stealth. They are widely used in C2 infrastructure because they can blend in with normal web traffic and are harder to detect and block.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the IEXPL0RE RAT is designed to record keystrokes and exfiltrate sensitive data, it is more likely to use methods that provide better security and stealth. Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are more reliable and less likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - Using blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure is less common and more likely to be detected, making it a less plausible choice for a sophisticated RAT like IEXPL0RE.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
