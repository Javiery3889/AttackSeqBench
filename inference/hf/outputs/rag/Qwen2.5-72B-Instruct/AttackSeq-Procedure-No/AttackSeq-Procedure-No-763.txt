### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Charming Kitten is likely to have collected detailed information about their targets (geographic location and working times) only after deploying phishing attacks and crafting fake security alerts, and then proceeded to add hidden tracking images and use artifact-based images for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying files, directories, or registry keys to match the names or locations of legitimate system or application components to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves collecting information from the browser, such as browsing history, bookmarks, and cookies, to gain insights into the target's activities and preferences.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites or files to gather information or deliver malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link):**
     - Charming Kitten would likely use spearphishing links to gather initial information about the targets. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to gain initial access and collect basic information.
   - **Discovery (T1217-Browser Information Discovery):**
     - After gaining access through spearphishing, the attackers would use browser information discovery to gather more detailed information about the targets, such as geographic location and working times.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location):**
     - Once the attackers have detailed information about the targets, they might use defense evasion techniques like matching legitimate names or locations to avoid detection while deploying hidden tracking images and artifact-based images.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (collecting detailed information only after deploying phishing attacks and crafting fake security alerts, and then proceeding to add hidden tracking images and use artifact-based images for defense evasion) aligns with the typical attack flow of Charming Kitten.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence: spearphishing to gain initial access, browser information discovery to gather detailed information, and defense evasion to avoid detection.
