### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file.
   - It then asks whether the HTA file will communicate with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for Command and Control before executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, CVE-2017-11882 in an RTF document) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to evade detection and execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a communication channel with a remote server to receive commands and send data back.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The RTF document exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop an HTA file. This is the initial step in the attack sequence.
   - **Command and Control (T1102.002):** The question asks if the HTA file will communicate with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for Command and Control. These are cloud storage services that can be used for bidirectional communication.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1574.002):** The HTA file is then used to execute the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading to evade detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After the initial exploitation, the HTA file can be used to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel with a cloud storage service like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive.
   - Once the C2 channel is established, the HTA file can then execute the FinalBot backdoor using DLL sideloading to evade detection.
