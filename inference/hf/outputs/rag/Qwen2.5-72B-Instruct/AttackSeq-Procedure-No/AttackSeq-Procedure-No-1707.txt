### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Black Energy 2 will perform a specific sequence of actions:
     - Allocate memory in the `svchost.exe` process.
     - Launch the injected libraryâ€™s code using APC queue processing for persistence.
     - Evade defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC):**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process by queuing an APC to the target process's thread. The injected code is executed when the thread processes the APC.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055 - Process Injection:**
     - This is a broader category that includes various methods of injecting code into a process, including APC injection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Memory Allocation in `svchost.exe`:**
     - Black Energy 2 is known to use process injection techniques, and `svchost.exe` is a common target for such attacks because it is a legitimate system process.
   - **APC Queue Processing for Persistence:**
     - APC injection is a specific method of process injection that can be used for persistence. By queuing an APC to a thread in `svchost.exe`, the malware can ensure that its code is executed whenever the thread processes the APC.
   - **Encrypting Payload and Loading Plugins:**
     - Encrypting the payload and loading plugins are common techniques used by malware to evade detection and maintain persistence. Black Energy 2 has been known to use encryption to protect its payload and load additional modules.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of Black Energy 2. The use of APC injection for process injection and persistence, along with the encryption of the payload and loading of plugins, aligns with the related TTPs provided.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
