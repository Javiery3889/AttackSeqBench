### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials only after relying on Tor for anonymous communication during their command and control phase.
   - The key points are:
     - Stolen credentials are transmitted to C2 servers.
     - The use of Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase.
     - The sequence of these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data, which aligns with the transmission of stolen credentials to C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS for command and control communication, which suggests that FIN4 may use DNS for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using multi-hop proxies to obfuscate the command and control communication, which can be used for anonymity but does not specifically mention Tor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that FIN4 uses Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase and then uses C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials.
     - However, the related TTPs do not mention Tor. Instead, they mention DNS and multi-hop proxies, which are different methods for achieving anonymity and command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that FIN4 does not use Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase and instead uses other methods (like DNS and multi-hop proxies) for C2 communication.
     - The related TTPs support this by mentioning DNS and multi-hop proxies, which are consistent with the known methods used by FIN4.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the lack of mention of Tor, the most plausible sequence is that FIN4 uses DNS and multi-hop proxies for command and control, not Tor.

**Final Answer: B: No**
