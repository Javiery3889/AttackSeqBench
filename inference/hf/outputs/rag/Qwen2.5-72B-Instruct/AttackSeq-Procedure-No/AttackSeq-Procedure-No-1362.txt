### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the VERMIN malware:
     - Collects system information (machine name, username, local IP address) using WMI queries.
     - Asks whether it will use tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system and preparing it for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012 - Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082 - System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery:**
     - This aligns with the initial step of collecting system information using WMI queries.
   - **T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:**
     - This aligns with the idea of storing collected data in a specific location, such as `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.
   - **T1012 - Query Registry:**
     - This is not directly relevant to the question of capturing mouse movements or storing keystrokes and clipboard data.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This would imply that VERMIN uses tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This would imply that VERMIN does not use tools to capture mouse movements and instead stores keystrokes and clipboard data.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that VERMIN is focused on collecting and staging data (T1074.001) and discovering system information (T1082).
   - Capturing mouse movements is not a common technique for data collection in the context of the given TTPs.
   - Storing keystrokes and clipboard data is a more typical method for collecting sensitive information.

### Final Answer: B: No
