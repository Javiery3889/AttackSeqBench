### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda's Korplug variant, after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP with compressed and encrypted messages, is likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving data before exfiltration, which aligns with the custom protocol for data exfiltration mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory paths, which is a form of data discovery. This is relevant to the question of whether the malware performs data discovery on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to perform data discovery on the system.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after compressing and encrypting data for exfiltration, the malware would also perform data discovery to identify and collect metadata and content from all mapped drives. This is a common sequence in many cyber attacks where data discovery is a necessary step before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to perform data discovery on the system.
     - This is less plausible because data discovery is a crucial step in the attack chain, especially for data exfiltration. Without discovering the data, the malware would not know what to exfiltrate.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible answer is that the malware is likely to perform data discovery on the system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
