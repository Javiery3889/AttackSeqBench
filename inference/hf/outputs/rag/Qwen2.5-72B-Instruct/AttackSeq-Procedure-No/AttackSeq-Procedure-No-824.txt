### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TG-3279 will create and cultivate profile pages in Microsoft TechNet before gaining initial access using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets.
   - The key points are:
     - Reconnaissance via open source research and network scanning.
     - Creating and cultivating profile pages in Microsoft TechNet.
     - Gaining initial access using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems and networks.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595-Active Scanning:**
     - This technique involves actively probing and scanning networks to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The related TTPs focus on reconnaissance activities such as vulnerability scanning and active scanning. These activities are consistent with the initial steps of the attack sequence described in the question.
   - **Creating and Cultivating Profile Pages:**
     - There is no mention of creating and cultivating profile pages in Microsoft TechNet in the related TTPs. This activity seems out of place in the context of the reconnaissance and initial access phases.
   - **Gaining Initial Access:**
     - The use of tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1595.002 (Vulnerability Scanning) and T1595 (Active Scanning).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is unlikely that TG-3279 would create and cultivate profile pages in Microsoft TechNet before gaining initial access using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk'. The focus of the TTPs is on reconnaissance and scanning activities, which are more aligned with the described sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: B: No**
