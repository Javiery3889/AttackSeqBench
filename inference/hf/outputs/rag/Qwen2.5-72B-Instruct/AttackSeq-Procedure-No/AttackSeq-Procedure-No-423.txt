### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Word document, which can lead to initial access.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBS) scripts to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious Word document (T1204.002-Malicious File).
   - **Execution of VBS Macro:**
     - The Word document likely contains a VBS macro (T1059.005-Visual Basic) that is executed when the user opens the document.
   - **Execution of PowerShell Script:**
     - The VBS macro can then retrieve and execute an encoded PowerShell script (T1059.001-PowerShell).
   - **Download of Payloads:**
     - The PowerShell script can then be used to download additional payloads, such as Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Phishing email with a malicious Word document.
     2. User opens the Word document, triggering a VBS macro.
     3. VBS macro retrieves and executes an encoded PowerShell script.
     4. PowerShell script downloads payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs and is a common attack pattern.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

**Reasoning:**
- The question asks if it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute **only** before being retrieved via a VBS macro. This implies a sequence where the PowerShell script is executed first, and then the VBS macro retrieves it, which is not the typical sequence.
- The correct sequence, based on the related TTPs and common attack patterns, is that the VBS macro is executed first, which then retrieves and executes the PowerShell script.
- Therefore, the answer is "No" because the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible or typical sequence.
