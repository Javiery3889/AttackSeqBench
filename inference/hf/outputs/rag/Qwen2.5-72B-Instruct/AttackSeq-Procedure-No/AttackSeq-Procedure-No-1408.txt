### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence involves using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.
   - The question then asks if FIN13 is likely to obtain credential information from `/etc/shadow` using the `shadow.py` module before gathering network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow:**
     - This technique involves accessing and extracting credentials from the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files on Unix-like systems.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which can include various methods such as accessing credential stores, memory, and other system files.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files:**
     - This technique involves searching for and extracting credentials from files on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Trojanized KeePass Binaries for Privilege Escalation:**
     - Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords is a method to gain initial access to credentials.
   - **Step 2: Obtaining Credential Information from `/etc/shadow`:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is logical for the threat actor to attempt to extract more credentials from the system.
     - The `/etc/shadow` file contains hashed passwords for user accounts, which is a valuable target for credential access.
     - The `shadow.py` module is a tool that can be used to extract this information.
   - **Step 3: Gathering Network and Host Configuration Details:**
     - Once the threat actor has obtained additional credentials, they are likely to use these credentials to gather more information about the network and host configuration for internal reconnaissance.
     - This can involve using native OS binaries and custom malware to collect system and network information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is plausible that FIN13 would obtain credential information from `/etc/shadow` using the `shadow.py` module before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
