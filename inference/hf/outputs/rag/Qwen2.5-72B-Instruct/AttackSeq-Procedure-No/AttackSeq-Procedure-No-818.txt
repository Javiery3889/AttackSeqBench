### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer is likely to use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication before it steals information from SNS (Social Networking Services) applications and encrypts this data using AES.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1048.003 - Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not typically used for C2 communication and is unencrypted.
   - **T1048.001 - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not typically used for C2 communication and is encrypted using symmetric encryption.
   - **T1071.002 - File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FTP for C2 Communication:**
     - The T1071.002 technique indicates that FTP can be used for C2 communication. However, FTP is typically unencrypted, which might not be the most secure method for C2 communication, especially for a sophisticated malware like WinDealer.
   - **Stealing Information from SNS Applications:**
     - This is a common tactic for malware to gather sensitive information.
   - **Encrypting Data Using AES:**
     - Encrypting data using AES is a common practice to protect the exfiltrated data from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **FTP for C2 Communication:**
     - While FTP can be used for C2 communication, it is less likely to be the primary method for a sophisticated malware like WinDealer, which would prefer more secure and less detectable methods.
   - **Stealing Information and Encrypting Data:**
     - Stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting it using AES is a plausible and common sequence for exfiltration.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sophistication of WinDealer, it is more likely to use a more secure and less detectable method for C2 communication rather than FTP. The sequence of stealing information and encrypting it using AES is plausible, but using FTP for C2 communication is less likely.
