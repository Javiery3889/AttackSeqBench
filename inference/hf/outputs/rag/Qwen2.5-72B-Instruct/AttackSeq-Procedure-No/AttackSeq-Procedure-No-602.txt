### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit group will use Scheduled Tasks through a Group Policy Object (GPO) to execute malware at a predetermined time after gaining initial access through email attachments containing malicious documents using VBA macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to achieve persistence or privilege escalation.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using Scheduled Tasks to execute malicious code at a specific time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through email attachments containing malicious documents using VBA macros. This is a common initial access technique used by various threat actors, including Sednit.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, the next logical step for an advanced threat actor like Sednit would be to establish persistence and escalate privileges. Modifying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) is a sophisticated method to achieve this.
   - **Execution of Malware:**
     - Once persistence is established, the attacker would need a way to execute the malware at a predetermined time. Using Scheduled Tasks is a common method for this purpose.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of the Sednit group. They are known to use sophisticated methods for initial access, privilege escalation, and execution of malware.
   - The use of VBA macros in email attachments for initial access, followed by modifying GPOs for persistence, and then using Scheduled Tasks for execution, is a plausible and sophisticated attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
