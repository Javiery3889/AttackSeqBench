### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic after modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries identifying running processes to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves adversaries concealing their activities by obfuscating files or information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique is relevant to the question because it involves monitoring and identifying running processes, which could include MsBuild.exe.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique is more about concealing activities rather than monitoring processes, so it is less directly relevant to the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe, which aligns with the T1057-Process Discovery technique.
   - The SUNSPOT malware, which is known for its sophisticated capabilities, would likely use process discovery to understand the environment and ensure its operations are not detected.
   - Monitoring MsBuild.exe could be part of the discovery process to understand the system's build and development activities, which could be relevant for further exploitation or evasion.
