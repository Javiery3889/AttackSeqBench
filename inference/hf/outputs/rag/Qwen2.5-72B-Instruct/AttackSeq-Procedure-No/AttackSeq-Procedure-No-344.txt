### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a zero-day exploit for Internet Explorer executes specific native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) before bypassing ASLR and DEP protections and executing shellcode to download the next stage payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Internet Explorer) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher-level privileges.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This is relevant because the zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer is an example of client-side exploitation.
   - **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This is relevant because the exploit might aim to gain higher privileges, which could involve bypassing ASLR and DEP.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This is less directly relevant to the initial exploitation but could be a technique used in the subsequent stages of the attack.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the zero-day exploit does execute the specified native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP and executing shellcode.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the zero-day exploit does not execute the specified native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP and executing shellcode.

5. **Reasoning:**
   - Zero-day exploits often involve a sequence of actions to ensure successful execution and privilege escalation. The specified native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) are commonly used to gather information about the system, which can be useful for the exploit to determine how to proceed.
   - Bypassing ASLR and DEP is a common technique used in exploits to gain control over the execution flow and execute arbitrary code.
   - The sequence described in the question (executing native functions, bypassing protections, and executing shellcode) is a plausible and common sequence in zero-day exploits.
