### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PROMETHIUM is likely to search for and compress Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module only after exfiltrating them to the C2 server.
   - The key points are:
     - PROMETHIUM encodes and splits archives into chunks.
     - The question is about the sequence of actions: whether the compression and archiving of Microsoft Office files happen after exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This sub-technique involves using a custom method to archive data, which aligns with the "unusual scheme" mentioned in the question.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection, which could be relevant to the splitting of archives into chunks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data and T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** These techniques suggest that the data is compressed and archived before exfiltration, not after. The custom method implies that the encoding and splitting happen as part of the archiving process.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique supports the idea that data is split into smaller chunks to facilitate exfiltration, which is consistent with the data being prepared before it is sent to the C2 server.
   - The question suggests a sequence where the data is exfiltrated first and then compressed and archived, which does not align with the typical TTPs described in the related techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is more likely that the data is compressed and archived before exfiltration, not after. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
