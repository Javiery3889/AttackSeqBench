### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda, after gaining initial access through phishing lures, is likely to use SSH tunneling during command and control before employing stagers to download additional shellcode for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol, which can include SSH tunneling.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which is consistent with phishing lures.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing Lures (T1204.001):** This is consistent with the question, as Mustang Panda gains initial access using phishing lures.
   - **Command and Control (T1572-Protocol Tunneling):** This technique can include SSH tunneling, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Command and Control (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer):** This technique involves downloading additional tools or shellcode, which aligns with the use of stagers to download additional shellcode.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (phishing lures, SSH tunneling, and stagers for downloading shellcode) is plausible based on the related TTPs.
   - Phishing lures (T1204.001) are used to gain initial access.
   - SSH tunneling (T1572) can be used for command and control to maintain a secure and encrypted channel.
   - Stagers (T1105) can be used to download additional shellcode for execution.
