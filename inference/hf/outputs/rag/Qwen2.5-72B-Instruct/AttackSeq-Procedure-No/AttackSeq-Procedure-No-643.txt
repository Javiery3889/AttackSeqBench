### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malware will collect system information (such as the OS version) only after ensuring persistence through the addition of a startup program or a system service, following activities like keylogging, clipboard logging, and screen recording.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the malware collecting information about the operating system and system configuration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves the malware collecting data from the clipboard.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging, Clipboard Logging, and Screen Recording:** These activities fall under the **Collection** tactic, where the malware gathers data from the victim's system.
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** This activity falls under the **Discovery** tactic, where the malware gathers information about the system to understand its environment.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring persistence is a separate tactic where the malware ensures it can maintain access to the system over time, often through techniques like adding a startup program or a system service.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Collection (T1115, Keylogging, Clipboard Logging, Screen Recording):** These activities are typically performed early in the attack to gather sensitive data.
     - **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery):** This can be performed at various stages, but it is often done early to understand the system environment and plan further actions.
     - **Persistence:** This is typically established after the initial foothold is gained and some initial data collection is performed to ensure the malware can remain on the system.

   - **Likelihood of Sequence:**
     - It is more common for malware to collect system information (T1082) early in the attack, possibly even before or during the initial data collection (T1115, keylogging, etc.), to understand the environment and plan further actions.
     - Ensuring persistence (adding a startup program or system service) is typically done after the initial data collection and system information discovery to maintain access.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is less likely that the malware will collect system information only after ensuring persistence. Instead, system information discovery is often an early step, and persistence is established later.

### Final Answer: B: No
