### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the XAgent component will delay execution of its core functionality using a timer after sending a hello message to its C&C server, instead of immediately communicating with the server via the HTTPChannel module to receive commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:**
     - This technique involves delaying execution of malicious activities to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:**
     - This technique is also about delaying execution to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent component will delay execution using a timer.
     - This aligns with the T1497.003-Time Based Evasion technique, which is listed under both the Discovery and Defense Evasion tactics. This technique is used to avoid detection by delaying the execution of core functionality.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent component will not delay execution and will immediately communicate with the server via the HTTPChannel module to receive commands.
     - This does not align with the T1497.003-Time Based Evasion technique, which is a key part of the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the XAgent component will delay execution using a timer to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
