### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement only after they have gained knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
   - **Technique: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework describes T1210 as a technique where adversaries exploit valid accounts and known vulnerabilities to gain access to remote systems. This often involves using remote desktop protocols (RDP), SSH, or other remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Before exploiting remote services, attackers typically need to gather information about the network, systems, and users. This is part of the discovery phase, which is crucial for identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. Exploiting remote services (T1210) is a common technique used for lateral movement.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is logical for attackers to first discover the network and identify potential targets before attempting to exploit remote services. This ensures that they have the necessary information to successfully move laterally.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement only after they have gained knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
