### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Sofacy will use `odbcconf.exe` to run DLLs on targeted hosts as a defense evasion technique after deploying malware through malicious websites and spear phishing emails that use zero-day exploits for initial access, and before leveraging domains for command and control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.008-Odbcconf:** This technique involves using `odbcconf.exe` to load and execute arbitrary DLLs.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using `rundll32.exe` to load and execute arbitrary DLLs.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The question mentions that Sofacy uses malicious websites and spear phishing emails with zero-day exploits for initial access. This is a common initial access technique used by advanced threat actors.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The question then asks about the use of `odbcconf.exe` for running DLLs as a defense evasion technique. The related TTPs include `odbcconf.exe` (T1218.008), `rundll32.exe` (T1218.011), and DLL side-loading (T1574.002). These techniques are all used for defense evasion and involve loading and executing arbitrary DLLs.
   - **Command and Control:** The question also mentions leveraging domains for command and control activities, which is a common next step after gaining initial access and evading defenses.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of Using `odbcconf.exe`:** Given that `odbcconf.exe` is listed as a related TTP for defense evasion, it is plausible that Sofacy could use this technique to run DLLs on targeted hosts. This would help in evading detection and maintaining persistence.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence described in the question (initial access, defense evasion, command and control) is a logical and common attack pattern. Using `odbcconf.exe` for defense evasion fits well into this sequence.
