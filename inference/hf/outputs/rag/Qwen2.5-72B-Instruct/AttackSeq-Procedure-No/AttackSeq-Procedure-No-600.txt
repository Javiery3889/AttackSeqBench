### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase after establishing initial access through malicious documents containing VBA macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. This is typically done during the Reconnaissance phase to gather information about the target network.
   - **Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network services and devices to understand the network topology and identify potential targets. This is typically done during the Discovery phase after gaining initial access.
   - **Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros to execute code. This is typically used to establish initial access by tricking users into opening malicious documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The question mentions that the Sednit group uses malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access. This aligns with the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.
   - **Discovery Phase:** After gaining initial access, the question asks if the malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning. This aligns with the T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks technique, which is typically used during the Reconnaissance phase but can also be used during the Discovery phase to gather more detailed information about the network.
   - **Targeting Government and Critical Infrastructure:** The question specifies that the scanning is related to government and critical infrastructure organizations. This is a common target for advanced threat actors like the Sednit group, which is known for targeting high-value targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the TTPs with the attack sequence described in the question, it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase after establishing initial access through malicious documents containing VBA macros.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
