### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an actor uses obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file into the system's temporary directory.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the actor will retrieve encrypted commands from a command and control (C2) server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
   - This TTP indicates that the actor is using obfuscation techniques to hide the true nature of the payload, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - The actor uses obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file into the system's temporary directory. This is a common initial infection vector and is consistent with the T1140 technique.
   - **Follow-On Actions:**
     - After the initial infection, it is common for malware to establish a connection with a C2 server to receive further instructions. This is a typical next step in many attack sequences.
     - Retrieving encrypted commands from a C2 server is a common tactic for maintaining stealth and controlling the infected system.
     - Cryptocurrency mining is a common follow-on action for malware, especially after establishing a foothold on the system and receiving commands from the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the initial actions and the common follow-on actions in malware sequences, it is highly likely that the actor will retrieve encrypted commands from the C2 server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
