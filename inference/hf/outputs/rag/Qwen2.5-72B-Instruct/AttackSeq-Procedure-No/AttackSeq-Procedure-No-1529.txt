### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that 'stopedge.bat' will manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after contributing to persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.
   - The key elements are:
     - Persistence: Scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.
     - Defense Evasion: Deletion of files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of malicious activity and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job):**
     - Scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs' is a common method for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malicious script runs at regular intervals.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070.004 - File Deletion):**
     - Deleting files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' is a common technique used to remove traces of the attack and evade detection. This can help the attacker maintain a low profile and avoid being discovered by security tools or administrators.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attacker has already established persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs', it is logical to assume that the attacker would also take steps to evade detection.
   - File deletion (T1070.004) is a common defense evasion technique that can be used to remove evidence of the attack, including auxiliary files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'.
   - The use of 'stopedge.bat' to manage the deletion of these files aligns with the goal of defense evasion.
