### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the delivery of KerrDown malware via malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading.
   - It asks whether it is likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture and contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Microsoft Office document, which then executes the malicious payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Base64 Blobs:**
     - Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate or encode data, including malicious payloads, to avoid detection by security software. However, the question specifically mentions that the base64 blobs are used to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture. This is a more sophisticated step that is not typically part of the initial execution technique described in T1204.002.
   - **Image File Instructing the Victim to Enable Macros:**
     - It is common for malicious Office documents to contain an image or text instructing the victim to enable macros. This is a well-known social engineering technique to trick users into executing the malicious code.
   - **DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL side-loading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL. This is often used in conjunction with other techniques to execute malware.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture is a more advanced and specific step that is not typically part of the initial execution technique described in T1204.002.
   - The presence of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a common and expected part of the initial execution technique.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question, particularly the use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture, is not a typical or necessary step in the initial execution of a malicious Office document. The presence of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is common, but the additional step of using base64 blobs for architecture-specific execution is not a standard part of this technique.
