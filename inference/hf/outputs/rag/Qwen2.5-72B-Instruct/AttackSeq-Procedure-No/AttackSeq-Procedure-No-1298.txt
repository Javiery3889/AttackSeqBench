### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker uses Procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) and then employs 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks (T1550.002-Pass the Hash).
   - The question then asks if the Fox Kitten Campaign is likely to use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process, which is consistent with the use of Procdump and Mimikatz.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to other systems, which is consistent with the 'Invoke the Hash' method.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is also listed under Defense Evasion, indicating that pass-the-hash can be used to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool that can be used for lateral movement by attackers. It can be used to distribute malware and tools across the network.
     - Given that the attacker has already achieved credential access and is using pass-the-hash for lateral movement, it is plausible that they would use a tool like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the Fox Kitten Campaign is unlikely to use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. However, given the context of the attack sequence and the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes, this answer is less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Fox Kitten Campaign would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
