### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after gaining initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports, adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.003 - Identify Business Tempo:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the organization's business operations, such as the frequency and timing of activities.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007 - Container API:**
     - This technique involves exploiting the Docker API to gain access to container environments.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.002 - Business Relationships:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the organization's relationships with other entities, such as suppliers, partners, and customers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that the initial access was gained through misconfigured Docker API ports, which aligns with the T1552.007 technique.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The question asks about the likelihood of gathering detailed knowledge of supply chain relationships during reconnaissance.
     - The T1591.002 technique (Business Relationships) directly relates to gathering information about the organization's supply chain relationships.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for adversaries to perform reconnaissance to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
     - Gathering information about business relationships (T1591.002) is a logical step in the reconnaissance phase, especially if the goal is to deploy malicious containers that can exploit these relationships.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
