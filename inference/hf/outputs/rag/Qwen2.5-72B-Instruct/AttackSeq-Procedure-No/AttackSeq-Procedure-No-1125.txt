### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that exploits an Adobe Flash vulnerability through specific URLs.
   - It asks whether the Flash exploit 'show.swf' is likely to attempt to evade defenses by embedding a payload in an animated GIF image 'b.gif' before executing shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Adobe Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to code execution.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This is directly relevant to the exploitation of the Adobe Flash vulnerability. The 'show.swf' file is likely to be the exploit that triggers the initial execution.
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique aligns with the idea of a malicious file being used to execute code. The 'b.gif' file could be a malicious file used to evade defenses.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique is relevant to the initial spear-phishing attack that delivers the exploit.

   Given these TTPs, it is plausible that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' would attempt to evade defenses by embedding a payload in an animated GIF image 'b.gif' before executing shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes. This is a common technique to bypass security measures and ensure the successful execution of the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' will attempt to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif' before executing shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
