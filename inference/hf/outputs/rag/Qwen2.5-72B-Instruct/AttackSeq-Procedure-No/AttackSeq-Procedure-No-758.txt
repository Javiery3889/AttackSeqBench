### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Initial reconnaissance (gathering system and network information).
     2. Communication to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for Command and Control (C2).
     3. Exfiltration of data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to the control server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding systems (like Base64) to obfuscate command and control traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the target environment.
   - **Communication to Servers Operated by Google Using Jabber/XMPP:**
     - Using well-known services like Google's servers and protocols like Jabber/XMPP for C2 can help the attacker blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltration of Data Obfuscated with Base64 Encoding:**
     - The related TTP (T1132.001-Standard Encoding) confirms that Base64 encoding is a known technique for obfuscating data during exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. The use of standard encoding (Base64) for data exfiltration is a known technique, and using Jabber/XMPP for C2 is a plausible method to avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
