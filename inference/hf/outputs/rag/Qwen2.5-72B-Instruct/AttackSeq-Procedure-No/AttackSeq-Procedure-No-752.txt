### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - The sequence of events mentioned includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     - Collecting the MAC address as part of discovery activities.
     - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries collecting information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other network-related details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain command and control over the infected host.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:**
     - This sub-technique involves checking for an active internet connection, which is a common step before attempting to communicate with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Downloading to Startup Folder):**
     - Ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder is a common tactic to maintain long-term access to the infected host.
   - **Discovery (Collecting MAC Address):**
     - Collecting the MAC address is a part of system network configuration discovery (T1016). This information can be useful for the adversary to understand the network environment and potentially for identifying the infected host.
   - **Command and Control (HTTP POST Requests):**
     - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests is a common method for exfiltrating data and receiving commands from the adversary.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would collect the MAC address as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers. The MAC address is a piece of network configuration information that can be useful for the adversary.
   - The sequence of events (ensuring persistence, collecting network configuration, and communicating with control servers) aligns with the described TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
