### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Charming Kitten likely gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase, after creating fake websites to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves collecting email addresses from various sources to identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites:** This technique involves searching for information on victim-owned websites, which can include contact forms and other publicly available information.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves creating or obtaining email accounts to support the attack, such as for phishing or credential harvesting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Charming Kitten did gather email addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.
     - The related TTPs T1589.002 (Email Addresses) and T1594 (Search Victim-Owned Websites) directly support this idea. These techniques are commonly used in the Reconnaissance phase to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Charming Kitten did not gather email addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1589.002 and T1594 are relevant to the Reconnaissance phase and align with the described activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of activities in a typical cyber attack, it is more plausible that Charming Kitten gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
