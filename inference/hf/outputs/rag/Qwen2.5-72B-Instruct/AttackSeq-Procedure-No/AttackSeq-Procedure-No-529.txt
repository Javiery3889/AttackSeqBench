### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Dropping Elephant will execute UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware before using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access.
   - The sequence in question is:
     1. Targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information.
     2. Executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.
     3. Using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks to identify and target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Step 2: Executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware**
     - Executing backdoors to download additional malware is a common tactic used after gaining initial access to a system. However, the question suggests this step happens before using spear-phishing emails.
   - **Step 3: Using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access**
     - The related TTPs (T1566.002 and T1566.001) clearly indicate that spear-phishing is a method used for initial access. This step should logically come before executing backdoors to download additional malware.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not logical because executing backdoors to download additional malware typically happens after gaining initial access, not before.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not likely that Dropping Elephant will execute UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware before using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access.
