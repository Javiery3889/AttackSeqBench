### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Rocra attackers:
     - Using a multi-functional framework to evade defenses via alternative communication channels.
     - Exploring the local area network using admin credentials for scanning.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct internal spearphishing attacks against executives, HR, and IT personnel during lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails to internal users to gain access to additional systems or credentials.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTP T1534-Internal Spearphishing suggests that internal spearphishing is a technique used for lateral movement. Given that the attackers have already used admin credentials for scanning and are exploring the network, it is plausible that they might use internal spearphishing to gain additional access or credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that internal spearphishing is not likely. However, the related TTP T1534-Internal Spearphishing indicates that it is a common technique for lateral movement, especially when the attackers have already gained a foothold and are exploring the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is likely that the Rocra attackers will conduct internal spearphishing attacks during lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
