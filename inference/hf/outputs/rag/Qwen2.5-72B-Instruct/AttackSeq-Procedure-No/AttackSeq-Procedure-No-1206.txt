### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sunburst backdoor, which was delivered through a supply-chain attack, is likely to use domain fronting to communicate with its C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique describes the method used to gain initial access through a supply-chain attack.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting:** This technique involves using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1195.002):** The Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack, which is consistent with the initial access technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS):** This technique suggests that DNS could be used for C2 communications, but it does not specifically address domain fronting.
   - **Command and Control (T1090.004-Domain Fronting):** This technique is directly relevant to the question, as it describes the use of domain fronting to disguise C2 communications.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Sunburst backdoor was designed to be stealthy and evade detection. Domain fronting is a technique that can help achieve this by making the C2 traffic appear to be legitimate traffic to a trusted domain.
   - Given the sophistication of the Sunburst backdoor and the use of domain fronting in other advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, it is plausible that the Sunburst backdoor would use domain fronting to communicate with its C2 server.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
