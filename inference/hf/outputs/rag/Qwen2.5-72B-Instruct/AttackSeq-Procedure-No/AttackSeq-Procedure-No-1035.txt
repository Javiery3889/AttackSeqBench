### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where APT10 logs into the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts, exhibits logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours, and then uses Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using existing, legitimate user accounts to gain initial access to a network. APT10 is known to use valid user credentials to log into networks, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS:**
     - This technique involves using tools like Mimikatz to extract password hashes from the NTDS.DIT file, which is a database file containing user account information in Active Directory. This aligns with the part of the question where APT10 uses Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access the Active Directory domain controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 will indeed use Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access the Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** APT10 uses valid user accounts to log into the network.
       - **T1003.003-NTDS:** APT10 uses Mimikatz to extract password hashes from the NTDS.DIT file.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 will not use Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access the Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that APT10 is known to use these techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that APT10 will use Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access the Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
