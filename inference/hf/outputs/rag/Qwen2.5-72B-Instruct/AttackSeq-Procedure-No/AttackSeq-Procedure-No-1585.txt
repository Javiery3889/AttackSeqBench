### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Earth Lusca is likely to use tools like `net`, `nltest`, and `ipconfig` to gather network information during the reconnaissance phase, but only after gaining initial access through spear phishing emails with malicious links.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using tools to gather information about the network configuration of the victim's system. Tools like `net`, `nltest`, and `ipconfig` are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using phishing emails to gain initial access to a victim's network. Spear phishing with malicious links is a common method under this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing):**
     - Earth Lusca would first gain initial access to the network through spear phishing emails with malicious links. This is a common initial access method.
   - **Discovery (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery):**
     - After gaining initial access, the next logical step for an adversary is to gather information about the network configuration to understand the environment better. This is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tools Used:**
     - The tools mentioned (`net`, `nltest`, and `ipconfig`) are commonly used for network reconnaissance and align with the T1016 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of an attack, it is plausible that Earth Lusca would use these tools to gather network information after gaining initial access through spear phishing emails with malicious links.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
