### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the BADBOX malware, after exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors, will most likely distribute via spearphishing links containing malicious files before injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the supply chain to introduce malicious components, such as firmware backdoors, into devices.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious files to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Supply Chain Compromise (T1195.003):**
     - The BADBOX malware has already exploited supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors. This means the initial access has been achieved through the supply chain compromise.
   - **Spearphishing Links (T1566.002):**
     - Spearphishing links are typically used to gain initial access to a target system. However, since the BADBOX malware has already achieved initial access through the supply chain compromise, it is less likely that it would need to use spearphishing links to distribute itself further.
   - **Injecting Additional Modules:**
     - Once the malware has initial access through the firmware backdoor, it can inject additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities. This step is logical and aligns with the typical behavior of malware after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the BADBOX malware has already achieved initial access through the supply chain compromise, it is less likely that it would need to distribute via spearphishing links containing malicious files. The more plausible sequence is that it would directly inject additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
