### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection, following the exfiltration of data via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data to a remote system, which aligns with the exfiltration of collected data via FTP.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather information, which is a form of data collection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (T1020):** The question states that data has already been exfiltrated via FTP, which aligns with the T1020 technique.
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):** The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger after exfiltration. Keylogging is a data collection technique, and it is common for malware to use multiple collection methods.
   - **Data from Local System (T1005):** This technique involves searching removable drives and skipping certain file types, which is also a data collection method. The question specifies that this activity happens before the keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (exfiltration via FTP, followed by searching removable drives and skipping certain file types, and then using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer) is not the most plausible based on the related TTPs.
   - Typically, data collection methods like keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing would occur before or during the exfiltration process, not after. The exfiltration of data via FTP suggests that the initial collection phase is already complete.
   - The T1005 technique (Data from Local System) is more likely to occur during the initial collection phase, not after exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
B: No
