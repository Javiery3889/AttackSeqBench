### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the skip-2.0 backdoor:
     - Utilizes hooks in the sqllang.dll service for stealth.
     - Blocks event logging to evade defenses.
     - Uses a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD.
     - Backdoors a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights.
     - Starts collecting emails from targeted mailboxes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions:**
     - This technique involves adding additional email delegate permissions to an account, allowing the attacker to access and manipulate emails.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts in cloud environments to perform actions that evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts in cloud environments to gain initial access to the target environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Utilizes hooks in the sqllang.dll service for stealth.**
     - This is a technique to evade detection by hooking into system services.
   - **Step 2: Blocks event logging to evade defenses.**
     - This is another technique to prevent the detection of malicious activities by disabling or manipulating event logs.
   - **Step 3: Uses a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD.**
     - This aligns with the T1078.004-Cloud Accounts technique, which involves using valid cloud accounts to perform actions.
   - **Step 4: Backdoors a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights.**
     - This is a sophisticated step that involves compromising a service principal to gain additional permissions, which is consistent with the T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions technique.
   - **Step 5: Starts collecting emails from targeted mailboxes.**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where the attacker uses the compromised service principal to access and collect emails, which is consistent with the T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The use of a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights and start collecting emails from targeted mailboxes is a logical and sophisticated attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
