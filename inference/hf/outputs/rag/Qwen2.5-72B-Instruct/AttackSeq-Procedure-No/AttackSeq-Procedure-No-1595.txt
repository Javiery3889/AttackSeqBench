### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Rocket Kitten, after establishing communication with a C&C server, will employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under the Tactic of Credential Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic:** Credential Access
     - **Technique:** T1056.001 - Keylogging

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials such as account names and passwords.
   - **Technique: T1056.001 - Keylogging** is a specific method under Credential Access where adversaries capture keystrokes to gather credentials.
   - The question states that Rocket Kitten establishes communication with a C&C server to download malware or monitor the victim's communications. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - After establishing this communication, the next logical step for an adversary like Rocket Kitten would be to gather more information and credentials to further their access and control over the victim's system.
   - Keylogging is a well-known and effective method for capturing credentials, which aligns with the Tactic of Credential Access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Rocket Kitten would employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under the Tactic of Credential Access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
