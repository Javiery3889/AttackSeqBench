### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Energetic Bear will compromise a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack to conduct a watering hole attack targeting Turkish critical infrastructure only before targeting software suppliers for programmable logic controller (PLC) components during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party organization to gain access to the target organization.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves placing malicious content on a website that the target is likely to visit, often through a watering hole attack.
   - **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This is a specific sub-technique of T1195 where the attacker compromises the software supply chain to deliver malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Supply Chain Compromise (T1195):** Energetic Bear could compromise a third-party supplier to gain access to the Turkish energy company's website.
   - **Drive-by Compromise (T1189):** Once the website is compromised, Energetic Bear could use it to conduct a watering hole attack, where they place malicious content on the website to target visitors from Turkish critical infrastructure.
   - **Compromise Software Supply Chain (T1195.002):** This technique involves targeting software suppliers, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase to gather more information or to prepare for a more sophisticated attack.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Compromising a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack.
     2. Conducting a watering hole attack targeting Turkish critical infrastructure.
     3. Targeting software suppliers for PLC components during the reconnaissance phase.
   - This sequence is plausible because:
     - Energetic Bear is known to use supply chain attacks (T1195) to gain initial access.
     - Once the website is compromised, a watering hole attack (T1189) is a common next step to target specific visitors.
     - Targeting software suppliers (T1195.002) during the reconnaissance phase is a logical step to gather more information or to prepare for a more advanced attack.
