### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe` only after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
   - The sequence of actions involves:
     1. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
     2. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.
     3. Executing the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads:**
     - Equation Editor exploits are typically used to deliver initial payloads and gain initial access to a system.
   - **Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`:**
     - This is a common technique for privilege escalation and maintaining persistence.
   - **Executing the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`:**
     - The FakeRun loader is a tool used to launch processes in a way that evades detection.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves using an initial exploit (Equation Editor) to deliver a payload, which then injects a malicious DLL into `dllhost.exe`. After this, the FakeRun loader is used to launch `dllhost.exe`.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - Initial access is gained using the Equation Editor exploit.
       - The malicious DLL is injected into `dllhost.exe` for persistence and privilege escalation.
       - The FakeRun loader is used to launch `dllhost.exe` in a stealthy manner.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
