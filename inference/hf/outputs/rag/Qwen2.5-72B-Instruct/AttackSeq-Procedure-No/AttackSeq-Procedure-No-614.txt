### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Hidden Cobra is likely to use phone calls (spearphishing voice) to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites before using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using phone calls to trick victims into performing actions, such as navigating to a malicious website.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating a trusted entity to gain access or information.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using phone calls to gather information about the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Hidden Cobra will use phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites before using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits.
     - The related TTPs indicate that Hidden Cobra uses spearphishing voice (T1566.004) and impersonation (T1656) to gather information and gain initial access.
     - It is plausible that Hidden Cobra could use phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites as part of their initial access strategy.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Hidden Cobra will not use phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites before using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits.
     - While spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits are a common method for initial access, the related TTPs indicate that Hidden Cobra also uses phone calls (spearphishing voice) as part of their attack sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs support the use of phone calls (spearphishing voice) as a method to gather information and instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites.
   - Given the context, it is more likely that Hidden Cobra would use a combination of phone calls and spear phishing emails to achieve their goals.
