### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for Command and Control (C2) communications after gathering detailed system and network information through the Aria-body backdoor during the Discovery tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):** This technique involves the use of algorithms to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communications. This is a common method to evade detection and ensure the availability of C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using the Domain Name System (DNS) for C2 communications. DNS is a widely used protocol that can be leveraged to send and receive data in a covert manner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of DGA (T1568.002) is a plausible technique for C2 communications. DGAs are often used by APT groups to create a large number of potential C2 domains, making it difficult for defenders to block all of them. This aligns with the sophisticated nature of the Naikon APT group.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - While DNS (T1071.004) is another valid technique for C2 communications, the question specifically asks about the use of DGA. Given that DGA is a more advanced and evasive method, it is more likely to be used by a sophisticated APT group like Naikon.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sophisticated nature of the Naikon APT group, the most plausible answer is that they are likely to use a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
