### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware uses InstallUtil.exe to evade detection by bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker.
   - The question then asks if the malware is likely to create a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that creating a scheduled task is a common method for ensuring persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This indicates that creating a scheduled task can also be used for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Creating a scheduled task is a well-known method for ensuring persistence (T1053.005).
     - After evading detection, it is logical for the malware to take steps to ensure it remains on the system, and creating a scheduled task is a common and effective way to do this.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the malware would not create a scheduled task, which is less likely given the context of the related TTPs and the common use of scheduled tasks for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions for malware, the most plausible answer is that the malware is likely to create a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
