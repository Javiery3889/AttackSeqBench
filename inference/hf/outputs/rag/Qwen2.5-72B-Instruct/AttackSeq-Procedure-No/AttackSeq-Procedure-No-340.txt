### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Nemesis bootkit, after achieving persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), is likely to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions:** This technique involves placing files in directories that are typically excluded from security scans to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique involves using a bootkit to maintain persistence by infecting the boot sector of the system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique is the same as the previous one but focuses on the persistence aspect of the bootkit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Nemesis bootkit will place install files in directories that are excluded from scanning to evade detection.
     - Given the related TTP T1564.012 (File/Path Exclusions), it is plausible that the bootkit would use this technique to avoid detection. Bootkits often employ multiple evasion techniques to ensure they remain undetected.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Nemesis bootkit will not place install files in directories that are excluded from scanning.
     - While the bootkit achieving persistence by infecting the VBR is a strong evasion technique, it does not preclude the use of additional evasion methods like placing files in excluded directories.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of advanced malware, it is likely that the Nemesis bootkit would use multiple evasion techniques, including placing files in excluded directories.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
