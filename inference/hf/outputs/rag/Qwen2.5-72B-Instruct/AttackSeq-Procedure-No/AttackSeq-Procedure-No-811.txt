### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer collected data from removable media and targeted relevant folders only after discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration, and then staged the encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection**
   - **Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging**
     - This technique involves an adversary collecting data from the local system and staging it in a specific location before exfiltration. The %TEMP% folder is a common location for staging data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery of Information:**
     - Before collecting data, an adversary typically needs to discover information about the infected PC and network configuration. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences to identify valuable data and understand the environment.
   - **Collection from Removable Media:**
     - Collecting data from removable media (T1114) is a specific technique that involves gathering data from USB drives, external hard drives, etc. This is often done after the adversary has identified the presence and value of such media.
   - **Targeting Relevant Folders:**
     - Targeting specific folders (T1083) is another technique where the adversary identifies and collects data from relevant directories based on the discovered information.
   - **Staging Encrypted Stolen Data:**
     - Staging the data in the %TEMP% folder (T1074.001) is a common step before exfiltration. The data is often encrypted to avoid detection and ensure integrity during transfer.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack flow:
     1. **Discovery** of the infected PC and network configuration.
     2. **Collection** from removable media and relevant folders.
     3. **Staging** the encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.
     4. **Exfiltration** to the C2 server.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
