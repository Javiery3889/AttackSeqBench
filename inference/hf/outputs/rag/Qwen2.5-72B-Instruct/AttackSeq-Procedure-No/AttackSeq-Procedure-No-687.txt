### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC for identifying internal hosts and remotely controlling software (Initial Access) only after using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 for Reconnaissance to enumerate services and authenticate via brute force.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services running on systems, which is also a form of reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 are typically used for reconnaissance to enumerate services and attempt brute force authentication.
     - These tools align with the T1018 and T1046 techniques, which are part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC are used for identifying internal hosts and remotely controlling software.
     - These tools are typically used after the reconnaissance phase to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance followed by initial access) is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns.
     - It is common for attackers to first gather information about the target network and then use that information to gain access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the alignment with the related TTPs, the answer is that it is likely that attackers will use the specified tools in the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
