### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Cobalt Strike's C2 server responds with an HTTP 200 OK to deliver `beacon.dll` only after generating raw malicious payloads in various formats for implementation and staging during execution.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - The use of `beacon.dll` to control an infected host.
     - The C2 server's response with an HTTP 200 OK.
     - The generation of raw malicious payloads in various formats.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP 200 OK Response:**
     - An HTTP 200 OK response indicates that the request was successful and the server is responding with the requested resource. In the context of C2, this means the server is successfully delivering the requested `beacon.dll`.
   - **Generation of Raw Malicious Payloads:**
     - Cobalt Strike is known for its ability to generate and deliver various types of payloads. However, the question specifically asks if the C2 server responds with an HTTP 200 OK only after generating these payloads.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - Typically, the C2 server would first deliver `beacon.dll` to the infected host. Once the beacon is established, the C2 server can then generate and deliver additional payloads as needed.
     - The generation of raw malicious payloads is a separate step that occurs after the initial beacon is established and the C2 communication is set up.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The C2 server does not need to generate raw malicious payloads before delivering `beacon.dll`. The delivery of `beacon.dll` is the first step in establishing the C2 communication.
   - The generation of additional payloads is a subsequent step that occurs after the beacon is active and the C2 server has established communication with the infected host.
