### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FoggyWeb, after downloading additional components from a C2 server, will passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves monitoring network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data using a custom method before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique is relevant to the passive monitoring of HTTP GET and POST requests. However, it does not specify the timing or the conditions under which this monitoring occurs.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique is relevant to the communication with the C2 server, which is a prerequisite for downloading additional components.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique is relevant to the exfiltration of data, such as the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a specific sequence of events: downloading additional components, exfiltrating sensitive data, and then passively monitoring HTTP requests.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of communication with a C2 server (T1071.001) and exfiltration of data (T1560.003), but they do not explicitly state the order of these actions.
   - Network sniffing (T1040) is a common technique used by malware to monitor network traffic, but the question specifies that this monitoring should occur only after exfiltration, which is not a typical sequence in most malware operations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware and the related TTPs, it is less likely that FoggyWeb would passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates. Malware often performs these actions in a more fluid and less rigid sequence.

### Final Answer: B: No
