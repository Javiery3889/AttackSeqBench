### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - The RTF document drops an embedded downloader file.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol before executing and attempting to download the full RAT component from a specific IP and port.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting client-side applications (like RTF documents) to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - The initial access is achieved through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, which aligns with T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question mentions a custom TCP protocol for C2, which is not explicitly covered by T1071.001 (Web Protocols). However, T1571 (Non-Standard Port) is relevant as it mentions using non-standard ports for C2 communication.
   - **Execution and Downloading:**
     - The malware is expected to execute and download the full RAT component, which is a common next step after initial access and C2 establishment.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The use of a custom TCP protocol for C2 communication is plausible, especially given the mention of a non-standard port (10001) in the question.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of using non-standard ports for C2, which aligns with the scenario described.
