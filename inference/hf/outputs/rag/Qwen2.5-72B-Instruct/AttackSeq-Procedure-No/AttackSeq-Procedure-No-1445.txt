### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if attackers will use phishing emails from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain for initial access only after exploiting vulnerabilities in remote desktop protocols (RDP) as part of reconnaissance activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing (T1566):** Phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send malicious emails to trick users into providing credentials or clicking on malicious links.
   - **Initial Access via Valid Accounts (T1078):** Using valid accounts can be a result of successful phishing or other means of credential theft.
   - **Lateral Movement via Internal Spearphishing (T1534):** This technique is used after gaining initial access to move deeper into the network.

   The question specifically asks if phishing emails from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain are used for initial access **only after** exploiting vulnerabilities in RDP as part of reconnaissance activities. 

   - **Exploiting RDP Vulnerabilities:** This is typically a technique used for gaining initial access or for lateral movement, but it is not a prerequisite for phishing.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This is a phase where attackers gather information about the target, which can include identifying RDP vulnerabilities, but it is not a necessary step before phishing.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (phishing from genuine accounts only after exploiting RDP vulnerabilities) is not a common or necessary sequence in typical attack patterns. Phishing can be used independently of RDP exploitation and is often a primary method for gaining initial access.

### Final Answer:
B: No
