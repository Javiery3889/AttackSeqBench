### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will map the network and collect passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz only after using spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini, given that they have already used PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using a stolen password hash to authenticate to a remote system without the need for the plaintext password.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Lateral Movement:**
     - The question states that the attackers have already used PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement. These tools are commonly used for remote command execution and are effective for moving laterally within a network.
   - **Network Mapping and Password Collection:**
     - After gaining access to multiple systems, it is common for attackers to map the network to understand the network topology and identify valuable targets. Tools like Nmap are often used for this purpose.
     - Collecting passwords is a critical step in maintaining and expanding access. Tools like Mimikatz are commonly used to extract credentials from memory or other sources.
   - **Spearphishing and GreyEnergy mini:**
     - Spearphishing emails are typically used as an initial entry point to gain a foothold in the network. However, the question states that the attackers have already used PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, which suggests they have already gained access to multiple systems.
     - GreyEnergy mini is a malware component that can be used for various purposes, including maintaining persistence and further lateral movement. However, it is not typically used as a post-lateral movement tool for network mapping and password collection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the attackers have already used PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, it is more likely that they would proceed directly to network mapping and password collection using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. The use of spearphishing emails and GreyEnergy mini would typically occur earlier in the attack lifecycle, not after lateral movement has already been established.

### Final Answer:
B: No
