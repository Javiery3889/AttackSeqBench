### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker has established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting a DLL (ResN32.dll) into explorer.exe.
   - The question then asks if T9000 (presumably a malware or threat actor) is likely to access the victim’s webcam and record video as part of its data collection efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video from the victim's webcam.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The attacker has already established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting a DLL into explorer.exe. This indicates that the attacker has a foothold in the system and can maintain it over time.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - The related TTPs include both video capture (T1125) and keylogging (T1056.001). This suggests that the attacker is interested in collecting various types of data from the victim.
   - **Likelihood of Video Capture:**
     - Given that the attacker has established persistence and is interested in data collection, it is plausible that they would use the video capture technique (T1125) to gather additional information, such as visual evidence or surveillance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the established persistence and the related TTPs, it is likely that T9000 would access the victim’s webcam and record video as part of its data collection efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
