### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021:
     - They accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials.
     - They dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they established command and control (C2) using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:**
     - This technique involves the use of one-way communication channels where the C2 server sends commands to the compromised system, but the compromised system does not send responses back.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate movement.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves the use of bidirectional communication channels where both the C2 server and the compromised system can send and receive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that TG1021 used a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point for C2.
     - The related TTP T1102.003 (One-Way Communication) supports this choice.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TG1021 did not use a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point for C2.
     - The related TTP T1102.002 (Bidirectional Communication) suggests that bidirectional communication is also a common method for C2.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of using a one-way communication method.
   - The related TTP T1102.003 (One-Way Communication) directly supports the use of one-way communication for C2.
   - While T1102.002 (Bidirectional Communication) is also a valid TTP, the question is specifically asking about one-way communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
