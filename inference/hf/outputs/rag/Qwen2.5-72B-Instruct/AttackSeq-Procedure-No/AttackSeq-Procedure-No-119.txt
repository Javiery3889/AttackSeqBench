### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor LYCEUM.
   - Initial access is gained through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
   - DanBot malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
   - The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would use DanBot to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe` before deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, which aligns with the delivery method described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - This is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors.
   - **Delivery of DanBot:**
     - DanBot malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
     - This aligns with the T1566.001 technique, which involves using spearphishing with attachments.
   - **Execution of Arbitrary Commands:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would use DanBot to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.
     - DanBot is a malware that can be used to execute commands, so this step is plausible.
   - **Deployment of DanDrop:**
     - The question then asks if DanDrop, an obfuscated macro tool, would be used to drop DanBot malware.
     - This step is also plausible because DanDrop is designed to drop malware, and it can be used to deploy DanBot.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the known TTPs of LYCEUM.
   - It is common for threat actors to use initial access methods to deliver malware, and then use that malware to execute commands and deploy additional tools.
   - The use of DanBot to execute commands via `cmd.exe` before deploying DanDrop to drop DanBot malware is a plausible sequence of actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
