### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is more likely to stage data on compromised hosts prior to exfiltration or use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives for files and skipping certain file types.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and organizing data on the local system before exfiltration.
   - **T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and organizing data on a remote system before exfiltration.
   - **T1115 - Clipboard Data:** This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Local Data Staging (T1074.001):** This technique is relevant because it involves collecting and organizing data on the local system before exfiltration, which aligns with the idea of staging data on compromised hosts.
   - **Remote Data Staging (T1074.002):** This technique is also relevant but involves a remote system, which is less likely in the context of the question.
   - **Clipboard Data (T1115):** This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which is a different method of data collection and does not align with the idea of staging data on compromised hosts.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions that CosmicDuke is searching removable drives for files and skipping certain file types, which suggests a more targeted and organized approach to data collection.
   - Given the context of searching and organizing files, it is more likely that CosmicDuke would stage the data on the compromised host before exfiltration rather than using a clipboard stealer.
   - The related TTPs (T1074.001 and T1074.002) support the idea of data staging, while T1115 (Clipboard Data) does not fit the described sequence as well.
