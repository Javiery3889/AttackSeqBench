### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PowerStallion is likely to exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS after using RPC and Microsoft OneDrive as command and control (C2) channels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. This could include protocols like HTTPS, which is commonly used for C2 communications.
   - **T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different, asymmetrically encrypted protocol that is not used for C2. This could include protocols like SFTP or other encrypted channels that are not part of the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If PowerStallion has already used RPC and OneDrive for C2, it is plausible that it could use HTTPS for exfiltration, as HTTPS is a common and often used protocol for both C2 and exfiltration. This aligns with T1041, which suggests exfiltration over the same channel used for C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that PowerStallion does not use HTTPS for exfiltration, which is less likely given the common use of HTTPS for both C2 and exfiltration. It would also contradict T1041, which suggests using the same channel for both purposes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of HTTPS for both C2 and exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
