### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Smooth Operator, after collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file during discovery, is likely to access and download information stored in SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the adversary is collecting system information, which includes the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that after discovering the OS version, Smooth Operator is likely to access and download information from SharePoint instances before communicating with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that after discovering the OS version, Smooth Operator is not likely to access and download information from SharePoint instances before communicating with the C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP (T1082-System Information Discovery) only confirms that the adversary is collecting system information, such as the OS version.
   - The question asks about a specific sequence of actions: collecting OS version, accessing SharePoint, and then communicating with the C2 server.
   - The provided TTP does not provide information about accessing SharePoint or the sequence of actions after discovery.
   - Without additional TTPs or context indicating that Smooth Operator typically accesses SharePoint or performs specific actions in a particular order, it is not reasonable to assume that accessing SharePoint is a likely next step.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
