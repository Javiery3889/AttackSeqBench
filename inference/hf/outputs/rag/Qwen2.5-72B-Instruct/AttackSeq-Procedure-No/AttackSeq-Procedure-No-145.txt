### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021.
   - They used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor would compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement only after establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying the system's owner or user, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.004-IIS Components:**
     - This technique involves using IIS components to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance aligns with the Discovery phase and the T1033 technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions compromising additional IIS servers for lateral movement, which aligns with the T1570 technique.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question specifies that the threat actor would establish command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function before compromising additional IIS servers.
     - The T1505.004 technique involves using IIS components for persistence, but it does not explicitly mention command and control or inline hooks on the IIS request validation function.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance, command and control, then lateral movement) is logical but not necessarily the only or most common sequence.
     - Typically, establishing command and control is a crucial step before performing lateral movement, but it is not always done through an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack and the related TTPs, it is not highly likely that the threat actor would compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement only after establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function. The more common sequence would be to establish command and control in a more general manner before moving laterally.

**Final Answer: B: No**
