### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information after establishing command and control (C2) communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like AES) to encrypt C2 communications to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to gather system information after establishing C2 communication.
     - The related TTP T1082-System Information Discovery supports this, as it is a common tactic for backdoors to gather system information to understand the environment and potentially exfiltrate this data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor is not likely to gather system information after establishing C2 communication.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as gathering system information is a common and logical next step after establishing C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical backdoor operation, the most plausible answer is that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to gather system information after establishing C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
