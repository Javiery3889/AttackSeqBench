### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the lightSpy malware is likely to perform data collection by targeting specific types of data (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data) after leveraging hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel, which is consistent with the malware using hardcoded C&C server locations for data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from various information repositories, which aligns with the idea of the malware targeting hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to perform data collection by targeting the specified types of data.
     - The related TTP T1213 (Data from Information Repositories) supports this, as it involves collecting data from various sources, including hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to perform data collection by targeting the specified types of data.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1213, which indicates that the malware is likely to collect data from various information repositories.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the lightSpy malware would perform data collection by targeting the specified types of data after leveraging hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
