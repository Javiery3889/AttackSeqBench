### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where WINDSHIFT APT sends benign daily emails to build a relationship with the target and track interactions using specific domains.
   - It then asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will use fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and employ social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1585.001-Social Media Accounts (Resource Development):** This technique involves creating and using social media accounts to support operations.
   - **T1586.001-Social Media Accounts (Resource Development):** This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information or support operations.
   - **T1593.001-Social Media (Reconnaissance):** This technique involves using social media to gather information about a target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Phase (Benign Emails):** The initial phase of sending benign emails to build a relationship and track interactions is a common tactic in social engineering and spear-phishing campaigns. This helps in establishing trust and gathering initial data.
   - **Subsequent Phase (Social Media Reconnaissance):** The related TTPs indicate that WINDSHIFT APT is likely to use social media accounts for resource development and reconnaissance. This aligns with the question's description of using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents.
   - **Logical Sequence:** The sequence described in the question (building trust through emails and then using social media for deeper reconnaissance) is a logical and common progression in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will use fake social media personas and social media mobile apps for reconnaissance after the initial phase of building trust through benign emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
