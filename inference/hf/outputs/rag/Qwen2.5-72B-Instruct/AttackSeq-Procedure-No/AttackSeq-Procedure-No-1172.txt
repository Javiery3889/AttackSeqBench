### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Taidoor malware, after avoiding detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware, is likely to use steganography to hide its command-and-control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002 - Steganography:**
     - This technique involves using steganography to hide C2 communications within other data, such as images or audio files.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003 - Steganography:**
     - This technique involves using steganography to evade detection by hiding malicious code or data within other files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Taidoor is likely to use steganography to hide its C2 communications.
     - The related TTPs provide strong evidence for this. T1001.002 specifically mentions using steganography for C2 communications, which aligns with the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Taidoor is not likely to use steganography to hide its C2 communications.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that steganography is a technique used for both C2 communications and defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Taidoor uses steganography to hide its C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
