### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WINDSHIFT APT is likely to send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages **before** the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The key point here is the timing: "before the Reconnaissance phase."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using a third-party service to send spearphishing emails.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The Reconnaissance phase is the initial stage where attackers gather information about the target. This includes monitoring social media, tracking email opens, and other passive information-gathering activities.
   - **Spearphishing and Credential Harvesting:**
     - Sending emails mimicking password recovery pages or using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages are techniques typically used in the **Execution** or **Action on Objectives** phases, not during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **Timing:**
     - The question specifically asks if these actions are likely to occur **before** the Reconnaissance phase. Given the nature of these techniques, they are not typically used before the Reconnaissance phase because the attackers need to gather information first to make their spearphishing attempts more effective.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that WINDSHIFT APT will send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages before the Reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
