### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to use the Office Test persistence mechanism by adding the Registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf` after injecting decrypted shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1112 - Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to change system behavior, which can be used for persistence or defense evasion.
   - **T1137.002 - Office Test:** This sub-technique involves using the `Office Test` registry key to ensure persistence. Specifically, adding the key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf` can be used to run arbitrary code when Office applications start.
   - **T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a registry key to the `Run` or `RunOnce` keys to ensure that a program runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 is likely to use the Office Test persistence mechanism.
     - Given the related TTPs, APT10 is known to use the `Office Test` registry key for persistence, which aligns with the technique T1137.002.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 is not likely to use the Office Test persistence mechanism.
     - However, the related TTPs indicate that APT10 does use this technique, making this choice less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known behavior of APT10, the most plausible answer is that APT10 is likely to use the Office Test persistence mechanism.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
