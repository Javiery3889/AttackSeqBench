### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gamaredon's malware, after using a backdoor to list interesting files (Office documents) during discovery, will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data only before inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is a common method for exfiltrating sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths, which is often used to locate interesting files for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data and then insert malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** The malware would first discover files and directories, which aligns with the initial step of listing interesting files.
       - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** The malware would then collect data from network shared drives, which aligns with scanning all drives for sensitive data.
       - Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence is a plausible next step after identifying and collecting sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data only before inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice implies that the malware might not follow the sequence described in the question, which is less likely given the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the malware will indeed scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data before inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
