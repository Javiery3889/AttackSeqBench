### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the CosmicDuke malware:
     - Using document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening malicious PDF files.
     - Executing the malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
     - Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.
     - Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data to a remote server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not part of the command and control (C2) channel, such as FTP and WebDav.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** and **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol** indicate that CosmicDuke can use FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
       - **T1005-Data from Local System** indicates that CosmicDuke can collect data from the local system, which aligns with keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to follow the described sequence.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as the TTPs clearly indicate that CosmicDuke can use FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and collect data from the local system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
