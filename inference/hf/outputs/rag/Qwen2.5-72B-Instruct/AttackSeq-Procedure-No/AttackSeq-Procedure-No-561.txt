### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have used Defense Evasion techniques (T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls) only after performing Discovery activities (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files, directories, or other artifacts in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain elevated privileges or to bypass security mechanisms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry):**
     - These techniques are used to gather information about the system, such as running processes and registry entries, to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques (T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls):**
     - These techniques are used to avoid detection and maintain persistence. Masquerading involves making malicious files or processes appear legitimate, while subverting trust controls involves bypassing security mechanisms.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Typically, attackers perform Discovery activities to understand the environment before they engage in Defense Evasion techniques. This is because the information gathered during Discovery helps them make informed decisions about how to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
     - For example, knowing the processes running on a system (T1057) and the registry entries (T1012) can help attackers identify which legitimate processes or registry keys they can mimic (T1036) or which trust controls they can subvert (T1553).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - It is logical and likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have used Defense Evasion techniques only after performing Discovery activities. The information gathered during Discovery is crucial for effectively employing Defense Evasion techniques.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
