### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers only after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution, following reconnaissance activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active network connections on a system.
   - **T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves monitoring user activity to detect and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:**
     - The question mentions reconnaissance activities such as gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods. These activities align with the T1018 and T1049 techniques, which are part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Installation through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution:**
     - Malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 often use macros in documents to execute and install themselves on a victim's system. This is a common initial infection vector.
   - **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - Once the implant is installed, it typically establishes communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions. This is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the implant would establish communication with C2 servers only after being installed through macro execution. This is a logical sequence because the implant needs to be present on the system to communicate with C2 servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible. Reconnaissance activities are followed by the installation of the implant through macro execution, and then the implant establishes communication with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B: No**
