### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the callCam app is likely to enumerate AWS infrastructure (such as EC2 instances) before encrypting data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration to the C&C server.
   - The key points are:
     - Evading detection through overlay screens.
     - Enumerating AWS infrastructure.
     - Encrypting data using RSA and AES.
     - Exfiltrating data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access by the victim, which is a common tactic in ransomware attacks.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) over a non-C2 (Command and Control) protocol.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) over a non-C2 protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Detection:**
     - The question mentions evading detection through overlay screens, which is a common technique to avoid user interaction and detection during the installation of malicious software.
   - **Enumerating AWS Infrastructure:**
     - The related TTPs do not mention any techniques related to enumerating AWS infrastructure. This step is not typically part of the exfiltration or impact tactics described in the TTPs.
   - **Encrypting Data:**
     - The TTPs T1486, T1048.001, and T1048.002 all involve encrypting data, which aligns with the question.
   - **Exfiltrating Data:**
     - The TTPs T1048.001 and T1048.002 specifically describe exfiltration over encrypted protocols, which aligns with the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs focus on encrypting and exfiltrating data, which are key steps in the attack sequence described in the question.
   - However, the TTPs do not mention any techniques related to enumerating AWS infrastructure, which suggests that this step is not a typical part of the attack sequence.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the callCam app will enumerate AWS infrastructure before encrypting and exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer: B: No
