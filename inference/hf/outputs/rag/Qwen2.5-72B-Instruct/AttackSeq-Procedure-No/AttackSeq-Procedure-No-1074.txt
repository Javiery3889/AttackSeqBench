### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where Tropic Trooper exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to download and install an MSI package.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that client software vulnerabilities, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158, will be exploited for execution instead of using malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution.
   - This technique involves an adversary exploiting a vulnerability in client software (e.g., web browsers, document readers, email clients) to gain execution on a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Method:**
     - Tropic Trooper initially gains access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. This is a specific and targeted method to download and install an MSI package.
   - **Client Software Vulnerability:**
     - The question mentions the possibility of exploiting client software vulnerabilities, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158, for execution.
   - **Malicious Documents:**
     - The question also mentions the use of malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper for execution.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given that Tropic Trooper has already gained initial access using a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor, it is less likely that they would switch to exploiting a different client software vulnerability (like CVE-2012-0158) for execution.
     - Once initial access is gained, adversaries often use the most reliable and effective method to maintain and expand their presence, rather than switching to a different exploitation technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is less likely that Tropic Trooper would switch to exploiting client software vulnerabilities like Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158 for execution after gaining initial access through the Equation Editor vulnerability.

**Final Answer: B: No**
