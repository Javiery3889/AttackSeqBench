### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 is likely to use DNS tunneling for command and control (C2) communication after discovering vulnerable systems through scanning IP ranges and reporting results to a centralized server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic:** Command and Control
     - **Technique:** T1071.004-DNS

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS** is a specific technique under the Command and Control tactic. It describes the use of DNS tunneling to communicate with C2 servers.
   - APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, is a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been observed using various sophisticated techniques for C2 communication.
   - DNS tunneling is a method where attackers encode data in DNS queries and responses to communicate with C2 servers. This technique is often used to bypass network security measures and maintain stealth.
   - Given that APT28 is known for using advanced and stealthy techniques, it is plausible that they would use DNS tunneling for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known capabilities of APT28, it is likely that they would use DNS tunneling for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
