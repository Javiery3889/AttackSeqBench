### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to conduct discovery activities (specifically system service discovery) only after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.
   - The key points are:
     - Achieving credential access using the Responder tool.
     - Conducting discovery activities (system service discovery).
     - Using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.
     - The sequence of these activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying system services, which is a common discovery activity.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:**
     - This technique involves using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Credential Access:**
       - The Lazarus group uses the Responder tool to acquire login credentials. This is the initial step.
     - **Lateral Movement:**
       - After obtaining credentials, the group is likely to use these credentials to move laterally within the network. The related TTPs suggest using SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002) and WMIC (T1047) for this purpose.
     - **Discovery:**
       - Once the group has established network connections and copied malware to remote hosts, they may then conduct discovery activities to gather more information about the compromised systems. System service discovery (T1007) is a common discovery activity that can be performed after gaining access to a system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if the discovery activities (system service discovery) are conducted only after lateral movement. Based on the related TTPs and the typical attack sequence, it is plausible that the Lazarus group would conduct discovery activities after establishing network connections and copying malware to remote hosts.
   - However, the question implies a strict sequence where discovery activities are conducted only after lateral movement, which may not always be the case. In some scenarios, discovery activities can be conducted before or concurrently with lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The Lazarus group is not likely to conduct discovery activities such as system service discovery only after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement. Discovery activities can be conducted at various stages of the attack, including before or concurrently with lateral movement.
