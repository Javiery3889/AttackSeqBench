### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access only after campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics, following the enabling of macros and file execution in randomly named directories during Execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, often through user interaction, such as opening a document with a macro.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of files or information, making it harder for security tools to detect malicious activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1204.002-Malicious File):** The use of a malicious document to gain initial access is a common tactic. This document often contains a macro that, when enabled, executes a payload.
   - **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File):** Once the macro is enabled, the malicious file is executed, which can lead to the creation of files in randomly named directories.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information):** After gaining initial access and executing the payload, the attacker may use obfuscation techniques to evade detection. This can include using publicly available code to bypass AppLocker or other security measures.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker uses a malicious document with a macro to gain initial access.
     2. **Execution:** The user enables the macro, leading to the execution of the payload, which may create files in randomly named directories.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** The attacker then uses obfuscation techniques, such as publicly available code, to bypass AppLocker and evade detection.

   - The question asks if it is likely that the payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access only after the use of obfuscation. This implies a sequence where obfuscation is a necessary step before the delivery of the payload, which is not entirely accurate. Obfuscation is typically used to evade detection after the initial access and execution, not as a prerequisite for the initial access itself.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most plausible answer is that obfuscation is used after initial access and execution, not as a prerequisite for initial access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
