### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Yellow Garuda is likely to use right-to-left override (RLO) to obfuscate the filenames of malicious e-mail attachments after maintaining persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template with a malicious macro-enabled template file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1221 - Template Injection:** This technique involves replacing legitimate templates with malicious ones, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the default Microsoft Word template is replaced with a malicious macro-enabled template.
   - **T1036.002 - Right-to-Left Override (RLO):** This technique involves using the RLO character to obfuscate filenames, making them appear different from their actual names. This is a method of defense evasion.
   - **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection, which can include using RLO to obfuscate filenames.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Yellow Garuda is likely to use RLO to obfuscate filenames.
     - Given the related TTPs, T1036.002 (RLO) is a known technique for obfuscating filenames, and it is part of the defense evasion tactic.
     - It is plausible that after maintaining persistence with a malicious template, the attacker would use additional techniques to evade detection, such as obfuscating filenames.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Yellow Garuda is not likely to use RLO to obfuscate filenames.
     - While this is possible, it does not align as well with the related TTPs, which include RLO as a known technique for defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of using multiple defense evasion techniques, the most plausible answer is that Yellow Garuda is likely to use RLO to obfuscate filenames.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
