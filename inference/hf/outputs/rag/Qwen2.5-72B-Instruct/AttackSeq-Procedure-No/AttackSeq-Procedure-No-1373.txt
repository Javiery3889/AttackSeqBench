### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that APT28 will create persistence through a batch file and registry entry only after gaining initial access using a malicious Word document with the DDE technique and then using PowerShell to download a file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or open files, often used in malicious documents to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access using a malicious Word document with the DDE technique. This aligns with the T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange TTP.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining initial access, the question states that PowerShell is used to download a file. This aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell TTP.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will create persistence through a batch file and registry entry. This is a common technique used by APT28 to maintain access to the compromised system. However, the question specifies that this persistence is created "only after" the initial access and PowerShell execution.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Gain initial access using a malicious Word document with DDE.
     2. Use PowerShell to download a file.
     3. Create persistence through a batch file and registry entry.
   - This sequence is plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of APT28. APT28 often uses a multi-stage approach where initial access is gained through social engineering (e.g., malicious documents), followed by the use of PowerShell for further execution, and then establishing persistence to maintain access.
