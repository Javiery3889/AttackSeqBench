### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in an internet-facing application for Initial Access, then uses cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor for Execution.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor will modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent for Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling:**
     - This technique involves using specific user agents or other signaling mechanisms to control the behavior of malware or to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services, such as SSH or RDP, to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attacker exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in an internet-facing application (T1190) to gain initial access.
     - The attacker then uses cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor (T1106-Execution).
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question asks if SparrowDoor will modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent.
     - The related TTP T1205 (Traffic Signaling) involves using specific user agents to control the behavior of malware or to communicate with a C2 server.
     - Modifying the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module to activate or deactivate based on the user agent aligns with the concept of traffic signaling, as it would allow the attacker to control the behavior of the malware or the C2 communication based on the user agent.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described TTPs with the concept of traffic signaling (T1205), it is plausible that SparrowDoor would modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module to activate or deactivate based on the user agent for Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
