### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious macro in an MS Office document downloads the RMS tool and supporting scripts.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the threat actors will attempt to kill the 'rundll32.exe' process before achieving persistence by adding a 'Microtik' string value to the registry and launching the RMS executable.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.010-Regsvr32:** This technique involves using the `regsvr32.exe` utility to execute arbitrary code, often to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` utility to execute arbitrary code, often to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Killing 'rundll32.exe':** The question suggests that the threat actors might attempt to kill the `rundll32.exe` process. However, `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to load and execute DLLs. Killing it could raise suspicion and potentially disrupt the system, which is not a typical behavior for stealthy threat actors.
   - **Achieving Persistence:** The question also mentions adding a 'Microtik' string value to the registry and launching the RMS executable. This is a common method for achieving persistence, which is a key goal for many threat actors.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence described in the question (downloading tools, achieving persistence) is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns. However, the step of killing `rundll32.exe` seems out of place and counterproductive.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the typical behavior of threat actors, it is unlikely that they would attempt to kill the `rundll32.exe` process before achieving persistence. The related TTPs suggest that `rundll32.exe` is often used to execute arbitrary code, not to be killed.

**Final Answer: B: No**
