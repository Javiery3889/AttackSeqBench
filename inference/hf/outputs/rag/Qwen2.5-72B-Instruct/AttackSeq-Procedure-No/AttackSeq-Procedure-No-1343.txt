### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by AURORA PANDA, a threat actor.
   - The sequence involves using exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization’s website.
   - The question asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves using vulnerabilities in client applications (e.g., web browsers, document readers) to execute code on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves placing exploit code, interactive commands, or other malicious content on websites that are likely to be visited by the targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - AURORA PANDA uses a strategic web compromise (SWC) to place exploit code on a U.S. organization’s website. This aligns with the initial access technique.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - The exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 is used to infect victims with ZxShell malware. This aligns with the execution technique.
   - **Sakula Malware:**
     - The question asks if Sakula malware is used to communicate with C2 infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code. However, the related TTPs do not mention Sakula malware. Additionally, the sequence described in the question does not suggest that Sakula malware is used before the exploit code.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using the exploit code to infect victims with ZxShell malware. There is no indication that Sakula malware is used in this sequence, especially not before the exploit code.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a C2 infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code.

### Final Answer: B: No
