### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the IEXPL0RE RAT (Remote Access Trojan) communicates with a C2 server using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the RAT will record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords as part of its collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is from the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
   - T1041 describes the method of exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. This is consistent with the question's description of using HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the RAT is likely to record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords.
     - Given that the RAT is already communicating with the C2 server and exfiltrating data, it is plausible that it would also engage in more detailed data collection activities, such as keylogging and exfiltrating sensitive data like passwords.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the RAT is not likely to record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords.
     - This seems less likely given the context of the RAT's capabilities and the nature of its communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of RATs, it is highly likely that the IEXPL0RE RAT would engage in keylogging and exfiltrating sensitive data as part of its collection activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
