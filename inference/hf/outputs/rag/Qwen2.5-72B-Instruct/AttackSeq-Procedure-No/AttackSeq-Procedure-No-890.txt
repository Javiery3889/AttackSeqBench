### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlackEnergy2 is likely to perform system service discovery using commands like `net start` after executing malicious plugins like `grc.dll` and `usb.dll`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1007-System Service Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering system services to understand the system's configuration and identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering peripheral devices, such as USB drives, to gather information or exfiltrate data.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and network configuration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The question mentions the execution of `grc.dll` for creating backup communication channels and `usb.dll` for collecting USB drive information. These actions align with the T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery technique.
     - After gathering information about peripheral devices, it is plausible that the malware would perform system service discovery (T1007) to understand the system's configuration and identify potential targets for further actions.
     - The final step mentioned is the use of the `dstr.dll` plugin to overwrite hard drive data, which is an act of sabotage. Understanding the system's services (T1007) would help in identifying critical services to target for maximum impact.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that BlackEnergy2 would not perform system service discovery after the initial actions. However, given the context of the related TTPs and the nature of the malware, it is less likely that the malware would skip this step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlackEnergy2 would perform system service discovery using commands like `net start` after executing the initial malicious plugins.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
