### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CARBANAK RAT beaconed to the Command-and-Control (C2) server and the PowerShell RAT communicated with a specific domain only after the attacker performed reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client.
     - CARBANAK RAT beaconing to a C2 server.
     - PowerShell RAT communicating with a specific domain.
     - Reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:**
     - This technique involves scheduling data exfiltration at specific times to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration using SmartFTP Client:**
     - This suggests that the data exfiltration has already occurred using a specific tool (SmartFTP Client).
   - **CARBANAK RAT beaconing to the C2 server:**
     - This is a common behavior for RATs to maintain communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **PowerShell RAT communicating with a specific domain:**
     - This indicates that another RAT (PowerShell RAT) is also communicating with a C2 server, possibly for different purposes.
   - **Reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure:**
     - This suggests that the attacker used Cobalt Strike to gather information and discover data before exfiltration, and this activity was conducted from a different set of infrastructure.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question implies a logical flow of events:
     1. The attacker uses Cobalt Strike to perform reconnaissance and data discovery from separate infrastructure.
     2. The attacker then exfiltrates the data using SmartFTP Client.
     3. After the data exfiltration, the CARBANAK RAT and PowerShell RAT communicate with their respective C2 servers.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of exfiltration over a C2 channel and scheduled transfers, which align with the described sequence.
