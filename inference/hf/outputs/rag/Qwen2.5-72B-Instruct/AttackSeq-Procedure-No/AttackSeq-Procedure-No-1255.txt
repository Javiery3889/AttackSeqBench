### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information (username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes) only after using HTTPS for C2 communication and potentially using Microsoft OneDrive and DropBox for bidirectional communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware gathering information about the victim system, such as the username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves the malware using cloud storage services like Microsoft OneDrive and DropBox for bidirectional communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **C2 Communication (T1102.002):** The malware first establishes a C2 channel using HTTPS and potentially cloud storage services like OneDrive and DropBox.
     - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** After establishing the C2 channel, the malware can then gather system information to send back to the C2 server.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - It is logical for the malware to establish a C2 channel first to ensure it can communicate with the C2 server before gathering and exfiltrating system information. This ensures that the gathered information can be sent back to the attacker.
   - **Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the malware gathers system information only after establishing the C2 channel.
     - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the malware might gather system information before or during the C2 communication setup.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of events and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware would gather system information only after establishing the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
