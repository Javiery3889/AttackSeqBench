### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TA505 is likely to execute Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands after gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.010 - Command Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating or encoding commands to evade detection.
   - **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information that were previously obfuscated or encoded.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2021-35211:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211). This is a known vulnerability that could be used to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Storing FlawedGrace RAT Loader:**
     - The question states that the FlawedGrace RAT loader is stored as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion. This aligns with the T1027.010 (Command Obfuscation) technique.
   - **Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - The question asks if Cobalt Strike Beacon is executed using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands. This also aligns with the T1027.010 (Command Obfuscation) technique.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves:
       1. Gaining initial access via CVE-2021-35211.
       2. Storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings.
       3. Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
     - This sequence is plausible because it follows a logical progression of actions that an attacker might take to evade detection and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
