### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to execute malware via DLL side-loading with benign executables only after gaining initial access using phishing lures related to official European Union and Ukrainian government reports.
   - The sequence of events described is:
     1. Gaining initial access using phishing lures.
     2. Employing stagers to download additional shellcode for execution during command and control.
     3. Executing malware via DLL side-loading with benign executables.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all related to DLL side-loading, which is a technique used for privilege escalation, persistence, and defense evasion.
   - DLL side-loading involves replacing a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, which is then loaded by a benign executable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing Lures:**
     - Phishing lures are a common initial access technique used by many threat actors, including Mustang Panda. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Employing Stagers to Download Additional Shellcode:**
     - Stagers are often used to download additional payloads, including shellcode, which is a common step in the command and control phase. This aligns with the second part of the sequence.
   - **Executing Malware via DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL side-loading is a technique used for privilege escalation, persistence, and defense evasion. It is a plausible next step after gaining initial access and establishing command and control. This aligns with the third part of the sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and plausible attack chain. Mustang Panda is known to use sophisticated techniques, and the combination of initial access via phishing, command and control via stagers, and execution via DLL side-loading is a well-documented attack pattern.
