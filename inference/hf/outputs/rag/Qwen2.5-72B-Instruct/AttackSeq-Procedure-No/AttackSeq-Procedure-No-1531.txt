### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Konni APT Group is likely to exfiltrate collected data via a POST request before sending it through 'unactivate.vbs'.
   - The key elements are:
     - Collection of information using 'versioninfo.bat'.
     - Exfiltration of data.
     - Use of 'unactivate.vbs'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
     - A POST request is a common method for exfiltrating data over HTTP/HTTPS, which is often used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Konni APT Group will exfiltrate the collected data via a POST request before using 'unactivate.vbs'.
     - Given the related TTP (T1041), it is plausible that the group would use a POST request to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Konni APT Group will not exfiltrate the collected data via a POST request before using 'unactivate.vbs'.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP (T1041), which indicates that exfiltration over the C2 channel is a common technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) and the common use of POST requests for exfiltration, the most plausible sequence is that the Konni APT Group will exfiltrate the collected data via a POST request before using 'unactivate.vbs'.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
