### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware (Shellbot) is likely to identify specific files and directories in the Linux operating system associated with storage devices before establishing and maintaining the IRC channel for receiving commands and orchestrating operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like IRC) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries identifying file and directory locations on a system, which can include storage devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique is focused on the communication aspect, specifically using IRC to maintain persistent communication with C&C servers.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique is focused on the discovery phase, where the malware identifies specific files and directories, which can include storage devices.

   - The question asks if the malware is likely to perform file and directory discovery before establishing the IRC channel. Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence of TTPs typically follows a logical order:
     1. **Initial Access:** The malware gains access to the system.
     2. **Command and Control:** The malware establishes communication with the C&C server.
     3. **Discovery:** The malware then performs discovery activities, such as identifying files and directories.

   - Given this sequence, it is more likely that the malware would establish the IRC channel first to receive commands and then perform file and directory discovery as part of its operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the malware is more likely to establish the IRC channel before performing file and directory discovery.

**Final Answer: B: No**
