### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, etc.):
     - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing campaigns to deliver exploit documents.
     - **Execution:** Installation and execution of a VBA script (vba_macro.exe).
     - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** Dropping malware like FONTCACHE.DAT.
     - **Lateral Movement and Command and Control:** Leveraging tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) scripts for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 is known for using spear-phishing campaigns to deliver exploit documents. This aligns with the initial access phase.
   - **Execution:**
     - The use of VBA scripts (vba_macro.exe) is a common technique for executing malicious code. This aligns with the execution phase and the related TTP T1059.005.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
     - Dropping malware like FONTCACHE.DAT is a method to maintain persistence and evade detection. This aligns with the defense evasion phase and the related TTP T1070.004.
   - **Lateral Movement and Command and Control:**
     - Tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE are known to be used by APT28 for lateral movement and command and control. This aligns with the later stages of the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of APT28.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
