### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dropping Elephant, after gathering victim identity information, is likely to scan specific lists of target IP addresses before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim, such as names, email addresses, and other identifying details. This is part of the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1595.001 - Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning specific IP address ranges to identify potential targets. This is also part of the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1083 - File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system, which is part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gather Victim Identity Information (T1589):** This is a logical first step in the attack sequence, as it helps the attacker identify potential targets and gather necessary information to tailor the attack.
   - **Scanning IP Blocks (T1595.001):** After gathering victim identity information, scanning specific IP blocks is a logical next step. This helps the attacker identify the network infrastructure of the target and find vulnerable systems.
   - **Executing UPX-packed Backdoors:** Once the target IP addresses are identified, the attacker can then deploy backdoors. UPX packing is a common technique to obfuscate malware and evade detection.
   - **Downloading Additional Malware:** After the backdoor is established, the attacker can use it to download additional malware to further compromise the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, it is likely that Dropping Elephant will scan specific lists of target IP addresses after gathering victim identity information and before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
