### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 is likely to retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module after using Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, before deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1003.004-LSA Secrets:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) on Windows systems.
   - **T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores:** This technique involves accessing and extracting secrets from cloud-based secret management services, such as AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager:** This technique involves accessing and extracting credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mimikatz and LSA Secrets (T1003.004):** Mimikatz is a well-known tool used to extract credentials from the LSASS process, which aligns with the first part of the question where APT15 gains domain administrator credentials.
   - **Cloud Secrets Management Stores (T1555.006):** This technique involves accessing cloud-based secrets, which is relevant to the part of the question about retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Windows Credential Manager (T1555.004):** This technique is not directly relevant to the question since it involves local Windows credentials, not cloud-based secrets.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Step 1:** APT15 uses Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials (T1003.004).
   - **Step 2:** APT15 retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager (T1555.006).
   - **Step 3:** APT15 deploys backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

   The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
   - APT15 would first need to gain high-level credentials to access cloud-based secrets.
   - After gaining these credentials, it makes sense to retrieve additional secrets that could be useful for further actions.
   - Deploying backdoors is a common next step to maintain persistence and control over the compromised environment.
