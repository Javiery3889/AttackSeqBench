### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a backdoor function, after being employed to collect machine information and take screenshots during the Discovery and Collection tactics, will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel **only** before collecting machine information and taking screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the victim's screen, which is a common method for collecting visual information from a compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the backdoor communicates with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots. This is unlikely because the communication with the C&C server is typically ongoing and can occur at multiple stages of the attack, not just before the collection of information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the backdoor does not communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots. This is more plausible because:
       - Communication with the C&C server is often continuous and can occur at various points during the attack, including during and after the collection of information.
       - Encrypted communication is a common practice to avoid detection, but it is not limited to a specific phase of the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor does not communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots.

**Final Answer: B: No**
