### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Vyveva's backdoor will access the victim’s webcam and record video after obtaining system information, and then compress the video using zlib for transmission to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as computer name, OS version, architecture, and local IP address.
   - **T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video from the victim’s webcam.
   - **T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves compressing data using a library, such as zlib, to reduce the size of the data before transmission.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** The question states that the backdoor has already obtained system information, which aligns with this TTP.
   - **Video Capture (T1125):** The question asks if the backdoor will access the victim’s webcam and record video, which aligns with this TTP.
   - **Archive via Library (T1560.002):** The question mentions compressing the video using zlib, which aligns with this TTP.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (obtaining system information, accessing the webcam, recording video, and compressing the video) is consistent with the related TTPs provided.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Vyveva's backdoor would follow this sequence of actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
