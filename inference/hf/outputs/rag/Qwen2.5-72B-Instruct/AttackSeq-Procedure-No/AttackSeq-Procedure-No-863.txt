### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit groupâ€™s operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails to gain initial access only after using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader, after employing COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the download of malware.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying registry keys to ensure that a malicious component is executed when a legitimate application is launched.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments that, when opened, execute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Sednit group is known to use spearphishing as a method for initial access. Both T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) and T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) are relevant here.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The group also uses COM object hijacking (T1546.015) to maintain persistence by adding custom registry keys.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question suggests a sequence where COM object hijacking is used for persistence, followed by the distribution of Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails, and then the use of a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - **Step 1:** The attackers use COM object hijacking to ensure persistence.
       - **Step 2:** They then use spearphishing emails to distribute Zebrocy components, which is a common initial access method.
       - **Step 3:** The Zebrocy components may include a Stage-1 downloader, which is used to download and execute a new downloader, furthering the infection process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions and the known TTPs of the Sednit group, it is plausible that they would use this sequence of techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
