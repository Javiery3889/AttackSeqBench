### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that ComboJack might use.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Ensuring persistence by setting a registry key.
     - Hiding itself using `attrib.exe`.
     - Storing output from command execution in a `.dat` file in the `%TEMP%` directory.
     - Replacing legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address.
     - Attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting data on the local system for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001 - Hidden Files and Directories:**
     - This technique involves hiding files and directories to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011 - Fileless Storage:**
     - This technique involves storing data in memory or other non-persistent locations to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Setting a Registry Key):**
     - This is a common technique for ensuring that malware runs at system startup.
   - **Hiding with `attrib.exe`:**
     - This aligns with the T1564.001 technique, which involves hiding files and directories.
   - **Storing Output in a `.dat` File in `%TEMP%`:**
     - This aligns with the T1074.001 technique, which involves local data staging.
   - **Replacing Wallet Addresses and Redirecting Funds:**
     - This is a specific action that is not directly covered by the provided TTPs but is a plausible next step in a financial malware attack.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs.
   - The use of `attrib.exe` to hide files and the storage of command output in a `.dat` file in the `%TEMP%` directory are consistent with the T1564.001 and T1074.001 techniques.
   - The final steps of replacing wallet addresses and redirecting funds are consistent with the goals of financial malware.
