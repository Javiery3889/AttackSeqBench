### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether UNC2452 likely used Discovery techniques (such as querying the registry and identifying running processes) only after establishing Command and Control (C2) communications using an Application Layer Protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a remote system for C2 purposes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying running processes on a system to gather information about the system and its environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **C2 Establishment (T1071):** The attacker first needs to establish a C2 channel to communicate with the compromised system. This is a prerequisite for any further actions, including discovery.
     - **Discovery (T1057):** Once the C2 channel is established, the attacker can use various discovery techniques to gather information about the system and the network. This includes identifying running processes, which can help in understanding the system's state and potential targets for further exploitation.

   - **Logical Order:**
     - It is logical and common for attackers to establish a C2 channel first to maintain control and communication with the compromised system. Only after this channel is established would they proceed with discovery techniques to gather more information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of events and the related TTPs, it is likely that UNC2452 employed Discovery techniques only after using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
