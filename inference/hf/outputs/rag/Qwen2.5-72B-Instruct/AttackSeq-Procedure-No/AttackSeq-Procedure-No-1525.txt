### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will access the server via panel login, SSH, or RDP only after acquiring a server through compromise or legitimate purchase and tuning configurations, after exposing the malware controller on a port to administer commands to infections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services such as SSH, RDP, or VNC to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access to a system over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services):**
     - Threat actors often use external remote services to gain initial access to a server. This can be done through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or purchasing access on the dark web.
   - **Persistence (T1133-External Remote Services):**
     - Once initial access is gained, threat actors may configure the server to allow continued access via external remote services. This can involve setting up backdoors, creating new accounts, or configuring services to allow remote access.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - **Step 1:** Threat actors expose the malware controller on a port to administer commands to infections.
     - **Step 2:** They acquire a server through compromise or legitimate purchase.
     - **Step 3:** They tune configurations to set up external remote services (SSH, RDP, panel login).
     - **Step 4:** They access the server via these external remote services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described, it is likely that threat actors will access the server via panel login, SSH, or RDP only after acquiring a server through compromise or legitimate purchase and tuning configurations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
