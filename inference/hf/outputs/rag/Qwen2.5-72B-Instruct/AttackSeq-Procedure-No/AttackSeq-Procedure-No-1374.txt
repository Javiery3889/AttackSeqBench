### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the APT28 threat actor.
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access using a malicious Word document with the DDE technique.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the actor will use Azure Run Command to execute code on virtual machines before connecting to a command and control (C2) server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using DDE in Office applications to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access with DDE:**
     - The use of DDE in a Word document to gain initial access is a known technique used by APT28. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Azure Run Command:**
     - Azure Run Command is a technique used to execute scripts on Azure virtual machines. This is a more advanced and specific technique that is typically used after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.
   - **Connecting to C2 and Dropping Seduploader:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for threat actors to establish a C2 connection to download and execute additional malware, such as Seduploader. This is a typical next step in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible but not the most likely sequence based on the related TTPs.
   - APT28 is known to use DDE for initial access and PowerShell for execution, but the use of Azure Run Command is a more advanced and specific technique that is not typically used immediately after gaining initial access.
   - It is more likely that after gaining initial access, APT28 would use PowerShell to execute code and establish a C2 connection to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

### Final Answer:
B: No
