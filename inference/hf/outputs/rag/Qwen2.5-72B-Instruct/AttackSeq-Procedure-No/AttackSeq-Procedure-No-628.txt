### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, after performing process discovery and system information discovery, would use blogs and WordPress for C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain a C2 channel. This can include using different protocols, domains, or services to avoid detection and ensure resilience.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the compromised system and the C2 server. This allows the attacker to send commands and receive data from the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique suggests that the backdoor might use multiple methods to establish and maintain C2. Blogs and WordPress sites can be used as part of a multi-stage C2 infrastructure because they are common and often not blocked by network security measures.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique requires a reliable and often covert method to establish a two-way communication channel. Blogs and WordPress sites can be used to host C2 servers or to relay commands and data, making them suitable for bidirectional communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure. These platforms are common, often not blocked, and can be used to establish multi-stage and bidirectional communication channels.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
