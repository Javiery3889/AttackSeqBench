### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that NanHaiShu's VBA macro will establish persistence by adding a .desktop configuration file to the user's `~/.config/autostart` directory before decoding and executing JScript data by writing it to `'%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js'` and executing it.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**

   These TTPs indicate that the attacker is likely to use methods to ensure that their malicious code runs automatically when the system starts or the user logs in. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This involves adding registry keys or files to the startup folder to ensure that the malicious code runs at startup.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence, including the use of registry keys and startup folders.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the VBA macro will add a .desktop configuration file to the `~/.config/autostart` directory to establish persistence before decoding and executing JScript data.
     - The .desktop configuration file in the `~/.config/autostart` directory is a method used on Linux systems to ensure that a program runs at startup.
     - However, the question also mentions writing JScript data to `'%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js'` and executing it, which is a method used on Windows systems.
     - The combination of using a Linux persistence method and a Windows execution method is unusual and less likely.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the VBA macro will not add a .desktop configuration file to the `~/.config/autostart` directory before decoding and executing JScript data.
     - Given that the TTPs mentioned are primarily related to Windows persistence methods (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder), it is more likely that the VBA macro will use a Windows-specific method to establish persistence.
     - The .desktop configuration file method is more typical for Linux systems, and it is less likely to be used in conjunction with a Windows-specific execution method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the VBA macro will use a Windows-specific method to establish persistence, rather than a combination of Linux and Windows methods.

Final Answer: B: No
