### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Aria-body backdoor.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Discovery**: Gathering system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP.
     2. **Command and Control (C2)**: Sending the collected data to a C&C domain using an XORed password.
     3. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration, which aligns with the first step in the question.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves setting up persistence by adding a program to the 'Run' registry key or the 'Startup' folder, which aligns with the third step in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1 (Discovery)**: The Aria-body backdoor gathers system information, which is consistent with T1016.
   - **Step 2 (Command and Control)**: The backdoor sends the collected data to a C&C domain using an XORed password. This step is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a common practice in malware to exfiltrate data before or after establishing persistence.
   - **Step 3 (Persistence)**: The backdoor establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key, which is consistent with T1547.001.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern in malware operations:
     1. **Discovery**: Gather information about the system.
     2. **Command and Control**: Send the gathered information to the C&C server.
     3. **Persistence**: Ensure the malware remains on the system by setting up persistence mechanisms.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and the alignment with the related TTPs, the answer is that it is likely that the Aria-body loader will establish persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key only after sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
