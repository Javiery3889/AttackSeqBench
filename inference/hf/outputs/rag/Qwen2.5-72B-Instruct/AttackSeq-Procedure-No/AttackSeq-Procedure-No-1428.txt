### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after extracting Chrome passwords (Credential Access), the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the initial step of extracting Chrome passwords.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves the automatic collection of data, which could include various types of data such as files, keystrokes, and screen images.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images after extracting Chrome passwords.
     - Given the related TTP T1119 (Automated Collection), it is plausible that the spyware could be designed to automatically collect additional data beyond just the Chrome passwords.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the spyware will not automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images after extracting Chrome passwords.
     - This choice implies that the spyware is limited to only extracting Chrome passwords and does not have additional automated collection capabilities.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP T1119 (Automated Collection) indicates that the spyware is capable of automatically collecting various types of data.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that after extracting Chrome passwords, the spyware could also automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
