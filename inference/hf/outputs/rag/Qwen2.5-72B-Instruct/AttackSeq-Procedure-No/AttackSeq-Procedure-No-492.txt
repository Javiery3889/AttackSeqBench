### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after the custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots from a victim's system, which is consistent with the use of a custom screenshot tool.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols, such as FTP, for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** The use of a custom screenshot tool aligns with the Collection tactic and the T1113 technique. This confirms that the tool is used to capture screenshots.
   - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique is part of the Command and Control tactic and specifically mentions the use of FTP for C2 communication. This suggests that FTP can be used for C2 purposes.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This answer suggests that it is likely that Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use FTP for C2 communication.
   - **B: No:** This answer suggests that it is unlikely that Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use FTP for C2 communication.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the related TTPs include the use of file transfer protocols (FTP) for C2 communication (T1071.002), it is plausible that Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon could use FTP for C2 communication. While FTP is not the most secure or stealthy method, it is a known and sometimes used protocol for C2 communication, especially in less sophisticated or older malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
