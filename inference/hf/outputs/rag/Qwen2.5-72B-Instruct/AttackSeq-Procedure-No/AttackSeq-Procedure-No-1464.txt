### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where adversaries use phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments to gain initial access. Once the employees enable macros, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTY for maintaining remote access before conducting internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using spearphishing within the internal network to move laterally.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services (like AnyDesk or PuTTY) to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that the initial access is achieved through spearphishing with weaponized MS Office attachments (T1566.001).
   - **Maintaining Remote Access:**
     - The question asks if the malware will use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTY to maintain remote access. This aligns with the T1133 technique, which involves using external remote services to maintain access.
   - **Lateral Movement and Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - The question also mentions internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting, which are typical steps after gaining initial access and maintaining remote access. The T1534 technique (Internal Spearphishing) is relevant for lateral movement within the network.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access through spearphishing with weaponized attachments, it is common for adversaries to use legitimate utilities to maintain remote access. This is followed by internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting to move laterally within the network.
