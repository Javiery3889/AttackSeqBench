### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy, a known threat actor, is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique involves compromising or bypassing MFA to gain access to systems.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access**: The question implies that SideCopy needs to establish initial access before executing the infection chains. The related TTPs include T1556.006, which is about compromising or bypassing MFA to gain initial access.
   - **Infection Chains**: The infection chains mentioned (malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs) are typically used for persistence and defense evasion. The related TTPs T1574.002 (DLL Side-Loading) are indeed used for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **Sequence**: The question asks if these infection chains are executed only after initial access. Given that T1556.006 is about gaining initial access and T1574.002 is about maintaining persistence and evading detection, it is logical that SideCopy would first gain initial access and then execute the infection chains.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access**: SideCopy would first use T1556.006 to compromise or bypass MFA and gain access to the victim system.
   - **Infection Chains**: After gaining initial access, SideCopy would then use techniques like T1574.002 to load malicious DLLs, create malicious LNK files, and use HTAs to maintain persistence and evade detection.
