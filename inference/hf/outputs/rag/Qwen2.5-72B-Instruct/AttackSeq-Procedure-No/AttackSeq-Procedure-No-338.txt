### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlackSoul, after gathering browser data, is likely to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic using OpenSSL before communicating with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON-based data encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves the use of standard data encoding formats (e.g., Base64, JSON) to obfuscate or encode data before transmission.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This TTP suggests that the C2 communication is likely to use web protocols, which can include HTTPS. HTTPS inherently uses encryption, often provided by libraries like OpenSSL.
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This TTP suggests that the data being transmitted is likely to be encoded in a standard format, such as JSON.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Encryption with OpenSSL:** The use of OpenSSL for encryption is a common practice in C2 communications to ensure data confidentiality. Given that the question mentions the use of the RESTful Strapi protocol, which is typically over HTTP or HTTPS, it is reasonable to assume that the communication is encrypted, and OpenSSL is a common library for this purpose.
   - **JSON-based Data Encoding:** The question also mentions JSON-based data encoding, which aligns with the T1132.001-Standard Encoding TTP. JSON is a standard format for encoding data in web protocols.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is plausible that BlackSoul would encrypt C2 traffic using OpenSSL before communicating with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON-based data encoding.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
