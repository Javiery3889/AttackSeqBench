### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Cobalt Strike will empty log files (a defense evasion technique) only after employing lateral movement (a technique for moving through a network).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their characteristics, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting log files to conceal the attackers' activities, which is part of the defense evasion phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase (T1018-Remote System Discovery):** The commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` are used to gather information about the current system and its environment. This is a typical part of the discovery phase.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is typically done after the initial discovery to spread the attack.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion):** Deleting log files is a technique used to cover the attacker's tracks and avoid detection. This can be done at various stages of the attack, but it is often done after the initial discovery and possibly after lateral movement to ensure that the attacker's activities are not logged.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes** - This suggests that log files are deleted only after lateral movement.
   - **Answer B: No** - This suggests that log files are not necessarily deleted only after lateral movement.

   Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack phases:
   - The discovery phase (T1018) is the first step.
   - Lateral movement is a subsequent step.
   - Defense evasion (T1070.004) can occur at various points, but it is often done after the initial discovery and possibly after lateral movement to ensure that the attacker's activities are not logged.

   Therefore, it is more plausible that log files are deleted after lateral movement to ensure that the attacker's activities on remote systems are not logged.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
