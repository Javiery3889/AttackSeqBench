### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the AURORA PANDA group.
   - They use CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware.
   - The initial access is through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organizationâ€™s website.
   - The question asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use BUSHWALK to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistent access to a compromised web application.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - AURORA PANDA uses CVE-2014-0322 to exploit a public-facing application (T1190).
     - This aligns with the initial access through a strategic web compromise (SWC).
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, they use ZxShell malware, which can be considered a web shell (T1505.003) to maintain persistence.
   - **Execution:**
     - The exploitation of the client application (T1203) is used to deliver and execute the ZxShell malware.

4. **Evaluate the Use of BUSHWALK:**
   - BUSHWALK is a specific tool used to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.
   - The question asks if it is likely that this specific tool will be used for command and control.
   - The related TTPs do not mention BUSHWALK or any specific modification of the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module.
   - The TTPs focus on initial access, persistence, and execution, but not on the specific use of BUSHWALK for command and control.

### Final Answer
Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, it is not likely that victim exploitation will use BUSHWALK to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs for command and control.

**Final Answer: B: No**
