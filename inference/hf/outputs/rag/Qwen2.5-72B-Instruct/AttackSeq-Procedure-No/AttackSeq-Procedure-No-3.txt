### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the SectorB06 malware:
     - Impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable file.
     - Performing process injection and timestomping for defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if the malware is likely to achieve persistence by adding IntelGraphicsController entries into registry run keys with a specific value format.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Persistence
     - **Technique:** T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
   - This TTP indicates that the malware is likely to use registry run keys to achieve persistence, which is a common technique for ensuring that the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will add IntelGraphicsController entries into registry run keys.
     - Given the related TTP (T1547.001), it is plausible that the malware would use registry run keys to achieve persistence.
     - The specific mention of "IntelGraphicsController" as the entry name is a bit unusual, but it is not uncommon for malware to use deceptive names to blend in with legitimate system entries.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not add IntelGraphicsController entries into registry run keys.
     - This would mean that the malware does not use this method to achieve persistence, which contradicts the related TTP (T1547.001).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the plausibility of the malware using registry run keys for persistence, the most likely answer is that the malware will add IntelGraphicsController entries into registry run keys.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
