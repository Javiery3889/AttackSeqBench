### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware first discovers system information using the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` and sends this information to an IP address `45.124.132.127`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server only after contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering system services, which is relevant to the initial command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Discovery and Information Exfiltration:**
     - The command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` is used to gather system information, which is a common initial step in many malware operations. This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic and the **T1007-System Service Discovery** technique.
   - **Exfiltration to IP Address:**
     - The information is sent to the IP address `45.124.132.127`, which is a form of exfiltration. This is a common step after discovery.
   - **Establishing HTTPS Communication with C2:**
     - The question asks if the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server only after contacting the domain `marina-info.net`.
     - The **T1071.001-Web Protocols** technique suggests that the malware can use HTTPS to communicate with the C2 server, but it does not specify the order of operations or the necessity of contacting `marina-info.net` first.
   - **Contacting `marina-info.net`:**
     - There is no explicit indication in the related TTPs that the malware must contact `marina-info.net` before establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server. The TTPs only describe the use of web protocols for C2 communication and the discovery of system services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, there is no strong evidence from the related TTPs that the malware must contact `marina-info.net` before establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server. The sequence described in the question is not a necessary or typical sequence based on the provided TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
