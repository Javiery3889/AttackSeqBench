### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlackEnergy 3 malware, after using HTTP to communicate with its C2 server and sending localization data and keyboard layout information, is likely to automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data without requiring additional commands from the attacker. This could include automated scripts or built-in features of the malware.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication. This is common in many malware families to maintain a low profile and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that BlackEnergy 3 has a built-in feature to automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox. However, the related TTPs do not specifically mention Dropbox. They focus on automated exfiltration and exfiltration over the C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that BlackEnergy 3 does not automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox. Given the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malware would use the C2 channel for exfiltration rather than a third-party service like Dropbox.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware is more likely to use the C2 channel for exfiltration (T1041) rather than a third-party service like Dropbox. Automated exfiltration (T1020) is a general technique that could be applied to various exfiltration methods, but the specific mention of Dropbox is not supported by the given TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
