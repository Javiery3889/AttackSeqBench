### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PyFlash, after establishing communication with its C&C server and using AES-128 in CBC mode for encryption, is likely to gather system information such as `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, and `arp` as part of the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables. The `arp` command is commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and system architecture. The `systeminfo` and `tasklist` commands are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric encryption, such as AES-128 in CBC mode, to secure command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that PyFlash will gather system information as part of the discovery phase.
     - The related TTPs T1016 and T1082 directly support this by indicating that gathering system and network configuration information is a common discovery technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that PyFlash will not gather system information as part of the discovery phase.
     - This choice is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that such information gathering is a standard part of the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in the discovery phase, it is highly likely that PyFlash will gather system information such as `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, and `arp` as part of the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
