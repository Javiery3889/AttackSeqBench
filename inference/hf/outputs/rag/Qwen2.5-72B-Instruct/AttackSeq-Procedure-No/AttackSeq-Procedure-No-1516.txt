### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a backdoor, after exfiltrating data over a C&C channel using encrypted communication, will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities and physical drive partitions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion of data to disrupt availability or conceal activities.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves the deletion of files to cover tracks and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique aligns with the use of CaddyWiper, which is known for wiping files and causing significant damage to systems, particularly in OT environments.
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique is more about deleting specific files to avoid detection, which is a common post-exfiltration activity but does not necessarily involve the extensive destruction of OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of CaddyWiper is a specific and highly destructive action that aligns with the T1485-Data Destruction technique. It is designed to cause significant damage to the target system, particularly in OT environments.
   - The sequence described in the question involves exfiltration followed by a destructive action, which is a common pattern in advanced cyber attacks. After exfiltrating data, attackers may deploy destructive malware like CaddyWiper to cover their tracks and cause maximum disruption.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
