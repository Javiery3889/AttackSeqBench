### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors would use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques only after gaining elevated permissions through Privilege Escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering system services to gain information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher-level permissions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:** The threat actors have already used system services and software deployment tools to execute code.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** To gain elevated permissions, the threat actors would likely use techniques like T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation).
   - **Discovery Phase:** After gaining elevated permissions, the threat actors would then use techniques like T1007 (System Service Discovery) and T1012 (Query Registry) to gather more information about the system and the internal network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Execution:** Threat actors execute code using system services and software deployment tools.
     2. **Privilege Escalation:** Threat actors gain elevated permissions using techniques like T1068.
     3. **Discovery:** Threat actors use techniques like T1007 and T1012 to discover system services and query the registry.

   - **Logical Flow:**
     - It is logical for threat actors to first gain elevated permissions before performing detailed discovery tasks. This is because many discovery techniques require higher-level permissions to access sensitive information.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is likely that threat actors would use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques only after employing techniques to gain elevated permissions under the Privilege Escalation tactic.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
