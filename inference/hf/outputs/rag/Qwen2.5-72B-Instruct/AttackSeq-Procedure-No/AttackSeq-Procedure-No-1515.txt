### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a backdoor installed by attackers first shuts down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication after the shutdown.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1529 - System Shutdown/Reboot:**
     - This technique involves the attacker causing a system to shut down or reboot, which can disrupt operations and impact system availability.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the attacker exfiltrating data from the victim's network over a C2 channel, which can be encrypted to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves a shutdown of the victim's computer to disrupt operations.
     - After the shutdown, the question asks if data exfiltration is likely.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - If the system is shut down, it is not operational, and thus, it cannot perform any data exfiltration over a C2 channel.
     - Data exfiltration typically requires the system to be running and connected to the network.
   - **TTP Context:**
     - T1529 (System Shutdown/Reboot) is focused on causing disruption and impact, which aligns with the shutdown described in the question.
     - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) requires the system to be active and connected to the network, which is not the case after a shutdown.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical flow and the context of the TTPs, it is not likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel using encrypted communication after the system has been shut down.

**Final Answer: B: No**
