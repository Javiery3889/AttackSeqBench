### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the PowerLess Backdoor, after discovering local user accounts, is likely to achieve credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and then using a keylogger.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, including credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which can include using tools like 'Comsvcs.dll'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):** This technique is typically used to capture credentials as they are entered by the user. It is a passive method that can be used over time to gather credentials.
   - **LSASS Memory Dumping (T1003.001):** This technique is more immediate and involves extracting credentials directly from the memory of the LSASS process. It is a more direct and effective method for obtaining credentials.
   - **OS Credential Dumping (T1003):** This is a broader category that includes various methods of credential extraction, including using 'Comsvcs.dll'.

   Given the sequence described in the question:
   - The PowerLess Backdoor first discovers local user accounts.
   - It then attempts to achieve credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll'.
   - Finally, it uses a keylogger.

   The sequence suggests that the primary method of credential access is through OS credential dumping using 'Comsvcs.dll', and keylogging is a secondary method used afterward.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. The PowerLess Backdoor is likely to use OS credential dumping (T1003) using 'Comsvcs.dll' as the primary method to achieve credential access, and keylogging (T1056.001) as a secondary method.

   Therefore, the answer is:
   **Final Answer: A: Yes**
