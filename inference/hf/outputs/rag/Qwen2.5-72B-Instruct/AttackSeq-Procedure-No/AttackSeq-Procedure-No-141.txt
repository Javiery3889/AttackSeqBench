### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials only after performing the initial access via an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials, which can be used for various purposes, including initial access or further lateral movement.
   - **T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves using domain properties to gather information, which can be useful for reconnaissance and planning attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Unpatched Vulnerability:**
     - The attack group used an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain initial access. This is a common method for gaining a foothold in a network.
   - **Phishing Domains for Credentials:**
     - Phishing domains are typically used to gather user credentials, which can be used to gain access to additional systems or to maintain persistence.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - If the attack group already gained initial access via the unpatched vulnerability, they might not need to use phishing domains to gather credentials immediately. However, they might use phishing domains to gather additional credentials for lateral movement or to maintain persistence.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The related TTPs suggest that the attack group might have used domain properties for reconnaissance before or after gaining initial access. This could include gathering information about the network, user accounts, and other relevant details.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the attack group already gained initial access via the unpatched vulnerability, it is less likely that they would use phishing domains to gather user credentials only after performing the initial access. Phishing domains are more commonly used for initial access or to gather additional credentials for further actions.

### Final Answer: B: No
