### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after exfiltrating AWS credentials over a C2 server, attackers will establish contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.
   - The key points are:
     - Exfiltration of AWS credentials over a C2 server.
     - Establishing contact with C2 servers.
     - Downloading shell scripts.
     - Encoding malicious binary files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data, which aligns with the exfiltration of AWS credentials.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which also aligns with the exfiltration of AWS credentials over a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of AWS Credentials:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that exfiltration over a C2 channel is a common technique.
   - **Establishing Contact with C2 Servers:**
     - Once the credentials are exfiltrated, it is logical that the attackers would need to maintain contact with the C2 server to continue their operations.
   - **Downloading Shell Scripts:**
     - Downloading shell scripts is a common method for attackers to execute further commands and maintain persistence.
   - **Encoding Malicious Binary Files:**
     - Encoding malicious binary files is a technique used to evade detection and ensure that the malicious payload can be executed on the target system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (exfiltrating AWS credentials, establishing contact with C2 servers, downloading shell scripts, and encoding malicious binary files) is a plausible and common attack sequence.
   - The related TTPs support the exfiltration and C2 communication aspects, and the additional steps (downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files) are typical follow-up actions in a multi-stage attack.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
