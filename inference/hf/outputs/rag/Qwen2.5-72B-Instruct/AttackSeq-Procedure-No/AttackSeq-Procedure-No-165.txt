### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.
     - Leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement.
     - Conducting internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves compressing data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data in a specific location before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Staging Exfiltration Data:**
     - The related TTPs T1560.001 and T1074.001 confirm that APT10 is known to use compression and local data staging techniques for exfiltration.
   - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:**
     - APT10 is known to target MSPs and leverage their infrastructure for lateral movement. This is a common tactic for APT10 to gain access to multiple client networks.
   - **Conducting Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - Once access is gained, APT10 typically conducts internal reconnaissance to understand the network topology and identify valuable targets. This often involves using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the known TTPs of APT10. They are known to stage data for exfiltration, leverage shared infrastructure for lateral movement, and conduct reconnaissance using common tools.
