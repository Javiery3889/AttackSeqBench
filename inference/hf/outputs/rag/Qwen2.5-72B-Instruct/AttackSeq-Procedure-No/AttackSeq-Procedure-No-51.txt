### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to exfiltrate collected data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it using utilities.
   - The key points are:
     - Utilizing Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.
     - Exfiltration through a covert channel.
     - Archiving data using utilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can be a covert channel.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:**
     - This technique involves using WMIC for execution and lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group is likely to exfiltrate data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it.
     - The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) supports the idea of exfiltration through a covert channel.
     - However, the question also mentions archiving data using utilities, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group is not likely to exfiltrate data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it.
     - The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) supports the idea of exfiltration through a covert channel, but the question also includes the step of archiving data, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) aligns with the exfiltration part of the question.
   - However, the question also includes the step of archiving data using utilities, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
   - Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence is that the Lazarus group is likely to exfiltrate data through a covert channel, but the step of archiving data using utilities is not strongly supported by the given TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
