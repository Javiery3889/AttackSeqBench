### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after a fallback C&C server becomes operational for communications.
   - This implies a sequence where the fallback C&C server is used first, and then the primary C&C server is used for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using secondary or alternate communication channels if the primary C&C channel is unavailable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the data will be sent to the primary C&C server only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.
     - This aligns with the T1008-Fallback Channels technique, which indicates that the fallback C&C server is used when the primary C&C server is not available.
     - However, it does not align with the typical sequence of operations where the primary C&C server is usually the first point of contact, and the fallback is used only if the primary fails.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the data will not be sent to the primary C&C server only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.
     - This aligns with the typical sequence of operations where the primary C&C server is the first point of contact, and the fallback is used only if the primary fails.
     - It also aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique, which implies that exfiltration typically occurs over the primary C2 channel unless it is unavailable.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of operations and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that the primary C&C server is used first, and the fallback C&C server is used only if the primary fails.
   - Therefore, the data will not be sent to the primary C&C server only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.

**Final Answer: B: No**
