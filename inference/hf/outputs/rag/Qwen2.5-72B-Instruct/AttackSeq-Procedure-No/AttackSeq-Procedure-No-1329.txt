### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Sayad malware will collect and exfiltrate sensitive data only after performing discovery activities such as collecting running processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the exfiltration of data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the collection of information from the browser, such as bookmarks, cookies, and other sensitive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Sayad malware will perform discovery activities (such as collecting running processes) before collecting and exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Sayad malware will collect and exfiltrate sensitive data without necessarily performing discovery activities first.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that Sayad malware is capable of both exfiltration and discovery activities.
   - The technique T1217 (Browser Information Discovery) is part of the Discovery tactic, which suggests that the malware performs discovery activities to gather information.
   - The technique T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is part of the Exfiltration tactic, which suggests that the malware exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - It is common for malware to perform discovery activities to understand the environment before exfiltrating data, as this helps in identifying and collecting the most valuable information.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, it is more plausible that Sayad malware will perform discovery activities before exfiltrating sensitive data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
