### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT10, including privilege escalation using DLL sideloading, evading defenses by loading a malicious DLL, and injecting Trochilus payloads into memory.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) servers to access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1484.002-Trust Modification:** This technique involves modifying trust relationships to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading):** This technique is used to gain higher privileges, which is a common step in an attack to perform more advanced actions.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1484.002-Trust Modification):** This technique is used to modify trust relationships, which can help in maintaining access and evading detection.

   - **Gathering Encryption Keys:**
     - APT10 is known for targeting cloud and on-premises infrastructure, including Active Directory and Azure AD services.
     - Gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and ADFS servers is a logical next step after gaining elevated privileges and evading defenses. This would allow the attacker to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the domain controller.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the known tactics of APT10, it is likely that they would gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to access the domain controller after performing the described actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
