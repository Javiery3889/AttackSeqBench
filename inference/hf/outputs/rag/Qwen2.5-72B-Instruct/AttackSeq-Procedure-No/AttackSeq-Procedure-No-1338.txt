### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malware, after using DLL sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion, will use multiple layers of encryption for C2 communication instead of connecting back to a specific domain.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to detect or disrupt the communication.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in a way that mimics legitimate behavior.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique is used for persistence and evasion. It allows the malware to load a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which can help the malware remain undetected and maintain a foothold in the system.
   - **Encrypted Channel (T1573):** This technique is used to protect C2 communications. It ensures that the data transmitted between the malware and the C2 server is encrypted, making it more difficult for defenders to intercept or analyze the traffic.
   - **Connecting to a Specific Domain:** The question mentions a specific domain (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org). This domain could be used for C2 communication, but it is not encrypted and can be more easily detected and blocked by defenders.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware has already used DLL sideloading to establish persistence and evasion, it is logical that the next step would be to protect the C2 communication to avoid detection and disruption.
   - Using multiple layers of encryption (T1573) is a common and effective method to protect C2 communication, especially after establishing persistence and evasion.
   - Connecting to a specific domain without encryption is less secure and more likely to be detected and blocked by network security measures.
