### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Carbanak group used LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising Domain Administrator credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique involves an attacker responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS queries to capture and relay authentication requests, which can be used to gain access to network resources and credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique is used to collect information from the network, such as credentials and other sensitive data, by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS queries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks are commonly used to map internal networks and collect credentials. These techniques can be used to gain administrative-level credentials, which can then be used to compromise Domain Administrator credentials and further compromise additional endpoints.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the Carbanak group did not use these techniques, which is less likely given the known TTPs of the Carbanak group and the effectiveness of these techniques in achieving the described attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the effectiveness of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks in mapping internal networks and collecting credentials, it is likely that the Carbanak group used these techniques as described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
