### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SideWinder APT group is likely to use obfuscation and data encryption methods only after encrypting the collected data for exfiltration to the C&C server.
   - The key points are:
     - The app collects device location information.
     - The group uses obfuscation and data encryption methods.
     - The question specifies the timing of these methods (only after encrypting the collected data).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration to reduce the size or to make it less noticeable.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves altering files or information to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the group will use obfuscation and data encryption methods only after encrypting the collected data.
     - However, the related TTPs indicate that obfuscation and data encryption are used to avoid detection and to make the data less conspicuous, which can be done at various stages of the attack, not necessarily only after encryption.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the group will not use obfuscation and data encryption methods only after encrypting the collected data.
     - This aligns better with the related TTPs, which indicate that these methods can be used at different stages of the attack to avoid detection and to make the data less noticeable.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of APT groups, it is more plausible that the SideWinder APT group will use obfuscation and data encryption methods at various stages of the attack, not just after encrypting the collected data.

**Final Answer: B: No**
