### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the GHOLE malware:
     - Employing a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence.
     - Creating a mutex called 'woolger' for defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that GHOLE will use legitimate websites such as GitHub or Pastebin through dead drop resolvers to communicate with its C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver, which is a method where the malware uses a predefined set of locations (e.g., web pages, files, or other resources) to retrieve C&C server information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services (e.g., GitHub, Pastebin) to host and communicate with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that GHOLE is likely to use legitimate websites like GitHub or Pastebin through dead drop resolvers for C&C communication.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** indicates that the malware can use predefined locations to retrieve C&C server information.
       - **T1102-Web Service** indicates that the malware can use legitimate web services for C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GHOLE is not likely to use legitimate websites like GitHub or Pastebin through dead drop resolvers for C&C communication.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1102.001 and T1102 are relevant to the described behavior.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described behavior of GHOLE, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the use of legitimate websites through dead drop resolvers for C&C communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
