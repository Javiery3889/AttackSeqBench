### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems by replacing the `pam_unix.so` file with a malicious version.
   - The context involves deploying malware components and maintaining persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):** This technique involves modifying PAM configuration files or replacing PAM modules to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves replacing or modifying dynamic linker configuration files to load malicious libraries.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):** This technique involves modifying PAM to evade detection and maintain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Replacing the `pam_unix.so` file with a malicious version is a known technique for maintaining persistence and can be used to intercept authentication credentials or maintain access.
     - The related TTPs, particularly T1556.003, directly support this method.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the Darkhotel APT does not use this method, which is less likely given the related TTPs and the known tactics of APT groups.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known tactics of APT groups, it is likely that the Darkhotel APT would use the method of replacing the `pam_unix.so` file to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
