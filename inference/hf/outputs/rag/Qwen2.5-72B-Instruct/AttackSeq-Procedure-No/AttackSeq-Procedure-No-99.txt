### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Trickbot:
     - Connects to a URL to download a payload.
     - Decodes the payload using `certutil.exe`.
     - Executes the payload during the Command and Control (C2) phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Trickbot will steal credentials and information from applications like Filezilla and internet browsers only after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which is a common method for credential theft.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from files, which can include configuration files, logs, and other data storage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Trickbot connects to a URL to download a payload.
     - Decodes the payload using `certutil.exe`.
     - Executes the payload during the C2 phase.
   - **Credential Theft:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that Trickbot is capable of stealing credentials from web browsers and files.
     - These actions are typically part of the Credential Access phase, which can occur after the initial payload execution and C2 establishment.
   - **Timing:**
     - It is logical for Trickbot to perform credential theft after establishing a C2 connection because:
       - The C2 connection allows the malware to receive further commands and exfiltrate stolen data.
       - The initial payload execution and C2 setup are necessary to ensure the malware has the necessary permissions and network access to perform credential theft.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is likely that Trickbot will steal credentials and information from applications like Filezilla and internet browsers only after it has established a C2 connection and executed the payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
