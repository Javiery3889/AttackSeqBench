### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will move laterally using credentials with Impacket's atexec tool only before using commands to discover remote systems.
   - The sequence involves using Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory, employing Impacket tools to perform pass-the-hash, and then moving laterally using atexec.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of pass-the-hash in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mimikatz to Dump Credentials:** The first step in the sequence is using Mimikatz to extract credentials from LSASS memory (T1003.001).
   - **Impacket Tools for Pass-the-Hash:** The next step is using Impacket tools to perform pass-the-hash (T1550.002).
   - **Lateral Movement with atexec:** The question asks if the threat actors will move laterally using atexec (an Impacket tool) only before discovering remote systems.
   - **Discovering Remote Systems:** Typically, before moving laterally, threat actors would first discover remote systems to identify potential targets. This is often done using network scanning tools or commands like `net view`, `ping`, or `nmap`.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While it is possible to move laterally using atexec immediately after obtaining credentials, it is more common and strategic for threat actors to first discover remote systems to identify which systems to target.
   - Discovering remote systems helps in understanding the network topology and identifying high-value targets, which is a crucial step before lateral movement.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that threat actors would move laterally using atexec only before discovering remote systems.
