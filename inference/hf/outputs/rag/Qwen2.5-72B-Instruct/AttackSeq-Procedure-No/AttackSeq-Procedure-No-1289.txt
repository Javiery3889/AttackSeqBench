### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to use the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to evade defenses within their spearphishing campaign after utilizing documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension:** This technique involves using a double file extension to make a file appear benign (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) to evade user and security defenses.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Mustang Panda is likely to use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique aligns with the use of malicious files in spearphishing campaigns.
       - **T1036.007-Double File Extension:** This technique specifically mentions the use of double file extensions to evade defenses, which is a common tactic in spearphishing.
       - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails, which can include links to malicious files or directly to C2 domains.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Mustang Panda is not likely to use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign.
     - The related TTPs do not support this choice:
       - The presence of T1036.007-Double File Extension in the related TTPs indicates that this technique is relevant and commonly used in such campaigns.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Mustang Panda is likely to use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
