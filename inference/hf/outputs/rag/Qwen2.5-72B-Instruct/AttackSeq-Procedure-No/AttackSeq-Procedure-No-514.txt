### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk (defense evasion).
     - Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process (defense evasion).
     - Using compromised residential endpoints within the same ISP IP address range as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic (command and control).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary system to mask the true source of the traffic.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves using various methods to obscure the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) to avoid detection.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy:** This sub-technique specifically involves using external proxies, which can include compromised residential endpoints, to route C2 traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1090-Proxy and T1090.002-External Proxy. Using compromised residential endpoints as proxies is a common method to hide the true source of C2 traffic, which fits the description in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs. It suggests that the attackers would not use compromised residential endpoints as proxies, which contradicts the techniques described in T1090-Proxy and T1090.002-External Proxy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the attackers are likely to use compromised residential endpoints as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
