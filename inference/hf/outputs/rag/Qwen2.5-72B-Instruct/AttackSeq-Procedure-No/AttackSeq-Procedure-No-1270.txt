### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers after initially compromising systems using the SocGholish framework.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Initial compromise using SocGholish.
     - Abusing AWS Systems Manager Inventory to identify targets.
     - Executing the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload using a .NET injector.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which is a common step in the discovery phase to understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard:**
     - This technique involves using cloud service dashboards to gather information about the environment, which can help in identifying targets and understanding the infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying software installed on systems, which can help in determining the presence of specific applications or vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Compromise using SocGholish:**
     - SocGholish is a known framework used for initial access, often disguised as legitimate software updates. This aligns with the initial compromise phase.
   - **Abusing AWS Systems Manager Inventory:**
     - AWS Systems Manager Inventory is a cloud service that provides detailed information about the resources in an AWS environment. Abusing this service for discovery aligns with the T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard technique.
   - **Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon using a .NET injector:**
     - Cobalt Strike is a popular post-exploitation tool, and using a .NET injector to execute it is a common technique for maintaining persistence and executing commands on the compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - It starts with an initial compromise using a known framework (SocGholish).
     - It involves using a cloud service (AWS Systems Manager Inventory) for discovery, which is a common technique in the discovery phase.
     - It concludes with the execution of a well-known post-exploitation tool (Cobalt Strike) using a .NET injector, which is a common method for maintaining control over the compromised system.
