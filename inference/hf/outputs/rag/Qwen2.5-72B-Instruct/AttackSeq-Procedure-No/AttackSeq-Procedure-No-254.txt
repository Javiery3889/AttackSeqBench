### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NanHaiShu, after gathering system information, is likely to create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts before downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves the use of internal proxies to route traffic between infected hosts and the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the infected system, such as IP addresses, volume serial numbers, and computer names.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves executing code using JavaScript.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Gathering (T1016):** The question states that NanHaiShu gathers system information, which aligns with the T1016 technique.
   - **Internal Proxy (T1090.001):** The question asks if NanHaiShu creates SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts. This aligns with the T1090.001 technique, which involves setting up internal proxies.
   - **Execution of JScript and VBScript (T1059.007):** The question also mentions downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code, which aligns with the T1059.007 technique.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (gathering system information, creating internal proxies, and then executing JScript and VBScript code) is consistent with the related TTPs provided.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that NanHaiShu would follow this sequence of actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
