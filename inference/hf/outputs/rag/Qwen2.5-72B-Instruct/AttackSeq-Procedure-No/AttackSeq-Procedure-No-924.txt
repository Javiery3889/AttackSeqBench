### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Emissary Panda group.
   - They exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.
   - They installed webshells on SharePoint servers.
   - The question asks if it is likely they then sent Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials.
   - Finally, it asks if they scanned the network for subsequently vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The group exploited CVE-2019-0604, which is a known vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint, to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Webshell Installation:**
     - Installing webshells on SharePoint servers is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access. Webshells allow attackers to maintain persistence and execute commands on the server.
   - **Credential Harvesting:**
     - Sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials is a plausible next step. This technique is often used to gain additional access and move laterally within the network.
   - **Network Scanning:**
     - Scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems is a common post-exploitation activity. Using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) is a known method for identifying and exploiting vulnerable systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with the typical attack lifecycle of an advanced threat actor like Emissary Panda.
   - The steps follow a natural progression from initial access to credential harvesting and network scanning.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
