### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module after using the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in their spearphishing campaign.
   - The double extension trick (T1036.007) is a technique used to evade defenses by making a file appear benign (e.g., a .doc file) while it is actually a malicious .lnk file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic between the attacker and the victim. A reverse SOCKS proxy is a specific type of proxy that allows the attacker to control the victim's network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension:** This technique involves using a double file extension to make a file appear benign to the user and security systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Double File Extension (T1036.007):** This technique is used to trick users into opening a malicious file by making it appear as a benign document. It is a common initial step in a spearphishing campaign.
   - **Reverse SOCKS Proxy (T1090):** This technique is used to maintain command and control (C2) over the compromised system. It allows the attacker to route traffic through the victim's network, which can help in evading detection and maintaining persistent access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After successfully tricking the user with the double extension trick, the attacker would likely want to establish a reliable and stealthy communication channel with the compromised system.
   - A reverse SOCKS proxy is a sophisticated method to achieve this, as it can help the attacker bypass firewalls and other network security measures.
   - Given that Mustang Panda is known for using advanced techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection, it is plausible that they would use a reverse SOCKS proxy as part of their communication strategy.
