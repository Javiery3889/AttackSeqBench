### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an attack group would exploit an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks **only after** attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase, and **after** securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials during the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The attack group would likely start with reconnaissance, which includes gathering credentials (T1589.001-Credentials). This is a common initial step to understand the target and gather necessary information.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attack group would secure alternative means of persistence (T1078.002-Domain Accounts, T1078-Valid Accounts). This ensures they can maintain access to the network even if their initial entry point is discovered and closed.
   - **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**
     - Exploiting an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks is typically an initial access technique (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application). However, the question specifies that this exploitation would occur **after** securing persistence, which is less common and less logical.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not typical. Normally, an attack group would exploit vulnerabilities to gain initial access, then move to reconnaissance and persistence. The idea of exploiting a vulnerability **after** securing persistence and gathering credentials is not a standard or logical sequence.

### Final Answer:
B: No
