### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor group Earth Lusca gathered network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and tools like PowerSploit before using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move malware or tools across the network. It also asks if this was preceded by initial access via spear phishing emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious code or move tools across the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves using spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link):**
     - Spear phishing emails with malicious links are a common method for gaining initial access to a target network. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Gathering Network Configurations and Domain Information:**
     - Once initial access is gained, threat actors often gather network configurations and domain information to understand the environment better. Tools like PowerSploit can be used for this purpose.
   - **Using Software Deployment Tools (T1072-Software Deployment Tools):**
     - After gathering the necessary information, threat actors may use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move malware or tools across the network. This aligns with the final part of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Earth Lusca would likely use spear phishing emails to gain initial access, then gather network configurations and domain information, and finally use software deployment tools to move malware or tools across the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
