### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an iOS malware:
     - Sends gathered information.
     - Writes log messages.
     - Uses a token for communication.
     - Uploads files during the Command and Control phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the app will subsequently collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which can help the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory structures, which can help the attacker locate and target specific data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs suggest that the malware is likely to engage in further data collection and discovery activities. The techniques T1082 and T1083 are part of the Discovery phase, which is typically followed by the Collection phase (T1005). This sequence aligns with the logical progression of an attack where the malware first discovers the system and then collects specific data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not collect additional information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. However, given the related TTPs and the typical attack sequence, this is less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of an attack, it is likely that the malware will collect additional information during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
