### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Rising Sun implant:
     - Initial reconnaissance to collect system and network details.
     - Use of RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves the use of standard data encoding schemes to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications. Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode data to make it appear less suspicious.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable. This is often used in conjunction with encoding techniques to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Rising Sun implant has already been described as using RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration. It is common for malware to use similar techniques for both data exfiltration and C2 communications to maintain consistency and reduce the complexity of the malware.
     - The use of HTTP POST requests is a common method for C2 communications, as it can blend in with normal web traffic and is less likely to be detected by network security systems.
     - The combination of RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding aligns with the T1132.001-Standard Encoding technique, which is used to obfuscate C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the Rising Sun implant would use a different method for C2 communications, which is less likely given the consistency in the use of RC4 and Base64 for data exfiltration.
     - It would be less efficient and more complex for the malware to use different methods for different stages of the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant would indeed communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
