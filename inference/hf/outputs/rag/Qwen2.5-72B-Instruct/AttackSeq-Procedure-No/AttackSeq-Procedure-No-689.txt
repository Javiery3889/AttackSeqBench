### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use `AutoExe1.bat` to download malware via BITS jobs **only** before identifying internal systems and remote control software.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access is gained by identifying internal systems and remote control software.
     - The use of `AutoExe1.bat` to download malware via BITS jobs.
     - The sequence of these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying networked systems and their resources.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs:**
     - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download and execute files.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs:**
     - This technique involves using BITS to evade detection by downloading and executing files in a stealthy manner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Discovery:**
     - The question states that the attackers gain initial access by identifying internal systems and remote control software using tools like Advanced IP Scanner and PushVNC.
     - This aligns with the T1018-Remote System Discovery technique.
   - **Using BITS Jobs:**
     - The question mentions the use of `AutoExe1.bat` to download malware via BITS jobs.
     - This aligns with the T1197-BITS Jobs technique for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use BITS jobs **only** before identifying internal systems and remote control software.
     - This implies a sequence where BITS jobs are used before the discovery of internal systems and remote control software.
     - However, the related TTPs suggest that the discovery of internal systems (T1018) typically happens before the use of BITS jobs (T1197) for downloading malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack stages, it is not likely that attackers would use BITS jobs to download malware **only** before identifying internal systems and remote control software.
   - The discovery of internal systems and remote control software is a necessary step before using BITS jobs to download malware.

**Final Answer: B: No**
