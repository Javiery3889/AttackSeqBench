### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Cobalt Strike retrieves encrypted commands from its command and control (C2) server for follow-on actions before delivering `beacon.dll` to control an infected host.
   - The key points are:
     - Generating raw malicious payloads.
     - Retrieving encrypted commands from the C2 server.
     - Delivering `beacon.dll`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves the transfer of tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Generating Raw Malicious Payloads:**
     - This is a common initial step in many attacks, where the attacker prepares the malicious code or payloads.
   - **Retrieving Encrypted Commands from the C2 Server:**
     - Cobalt Strike is known for its ability to communicate with a C2 server to receive commands and instructions. These commands are often encrypted to avoid detection.
   - **Delivering `beacon.dll`:**
     - `beacon.dll` is a key component of Cobalt Strike that allows the attacker to maintain control over the infected host. It is typically delivered after the initial infection and command retrieval.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical attack flow of Cobalt Strike:
     1. **Initial Infection and Payload Generation:**
        - The attacker generates raw malicious payloads, which can be used to initially compromise a host.
     2. **Command Retrieval:**
        - Once the initial infection is successful, the malware (e.g., a PowerShell script) will communicate with the C2 server to retrieve encrypted commands.
     3. **Delivery of `beacon.dll`:**
        - After receiving the commands, the malware will typically deliver `beacon.dll` to establish a persistent and controllable presence on the infected host.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the typical behavior of Cobalt Strike.
