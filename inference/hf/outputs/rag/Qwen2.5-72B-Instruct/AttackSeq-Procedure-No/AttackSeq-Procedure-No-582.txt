### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks after performing credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz and reading the memory of lsass.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
   - This TTP indicates that the attackers are using a technique to dump credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Dumping (T1003.001-LSASS Memory):**
     - This technique is used to extract credentials from the memory of the lsass.exe process, which is a common method for gaining access to user credentials.
   - **Anti-Sandboxing and Anti-Virtualization Checks:**
     - These checks are typically performed by attackers to ensure that they are not operating in a controlled or monitored environment, such as a sandbox or virtual machine. This is often done to avoid detection and to ensure that their actions are not being analyzed.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - After successfully dumping credentials, attackers often perform additional checks to ensure that their environment is safe for further operations. This can include anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks to avoid detection and to ensure that their actions are not being monitored.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that credential dumping is a critical step in gaining access to credentials, it is logical for attackers to perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks to ensure that their environment is secure before proceeding with further actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attackers are likely to perform these checks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
