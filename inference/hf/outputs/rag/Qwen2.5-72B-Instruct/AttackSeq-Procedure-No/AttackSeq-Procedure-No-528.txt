### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant threat actor is likely to use steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files after gaining initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1027.003 - Steganography**
   - This TTP indicates that the threat actor uses steganography to evade detection by hiding malicious content within seemingly benign files, such as PNG images.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that the threat actor gains initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. These are common techniques used to compromise a target system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - After gaining initial access, the threat actor needs to maintain persistence and avoid detection. Steganography (T1027.003) is a technique used to hide malicious content within files to evade detection by security systems.
   - **Steganography in PNG Files:**
     - Steganography can be used to hide malicious executables within PNG files. This technique is effective because PNG files are often considered benign and are less likely to be scrutinized by security systems.
   - **Decoding Encoded Blobs:**
     - The question also mentions decoding the encoded blobs, which is a step that would be necessary to extract the hidden malicious content from the PNG files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTP (T1027.003 - Steganography) and the context of the question, it is plausible that the Dropping Elephant threat actor would use steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
