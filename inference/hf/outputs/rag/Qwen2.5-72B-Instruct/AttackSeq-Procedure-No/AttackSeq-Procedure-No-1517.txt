### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions after data exfiltration over a C&C channel.
   - It asks if the backdoor was then used to collect detailed system information (file manipulation, screenshots, network details) and communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted protocol to send a 'Start conversation' message and receive a 'Get Victim Information' message.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is consistent with the initial part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exfiltration:**
     - The question states that data was exfiltrated over the established C&C channel, which aligns with T1041.
   - **Subsequent Actions:**
     - The question then asks if the backdoor was used to collect detailed system information (file manipulation, screenshots, network details) and communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted protocol.
     - This sequence of actions is not directly supported by the provided TTP (T1041). T1041 only covers the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel, not the subsequent collection of detailed system information or the specific communication protocol used.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - While it is possible that attackers might perform additional actions after exfiltration, the question implies a specific sequence that is not directly supported by the given TTP.
     - The detailed system information collection and the specific communication protocol (encrypted, 'Start conversation', 'Get Victim Information') are not part of the T1041 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the provided TTP and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor was not used to collect detailed system information and communicate with the C&C server in the specific manner described after the initial exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
