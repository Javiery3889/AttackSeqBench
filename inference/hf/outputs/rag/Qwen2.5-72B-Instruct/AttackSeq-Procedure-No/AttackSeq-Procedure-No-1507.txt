### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising:**
     - Malvertising involves the use of online advertising to spread malware. This technique is often used to redirect users to malicious websites.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to execute commands and scripts. It is often used by attackers to download and execute malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - Drive-by compromise involves the exploitation of a web application vulnerability to automatically download and execute malware on a victim's system when they visit a compromised website.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that the RIG EK uses malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites, and only after that, it runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Malvertising (T1583.008) is a common initial access technique used by exploit kits like RIG to redirect users to malicious websites.
       - Once the user is redirected, the exploit kit can use various techniques to deliver the payload, including running an obfuscated PowerShell script (T1059.001) to fetch and execute malware.
       - The sequence described in this answer aligns with the typical attack flow of an exploit kit.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the RIG EK does not use the described sequence of TTPs.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This answer does not align with the typical behavior of exploit kits, which often use malvertising to redirect users and then use scripting languages like PowerShell to deliver the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the typical behavior of exploit kits, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
