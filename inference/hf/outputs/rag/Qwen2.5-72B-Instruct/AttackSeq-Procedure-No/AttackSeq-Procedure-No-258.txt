### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
     - They deliver a Flash exploit "flash_video_x86.swf" via a spear-phishing email.
     - They establish the victim's machine as a valid target.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will make and impersonate tokens for privilege escalation to gain persistence on the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves using phishing emails to deliver malware or exploits to the victim.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token:**
     - This technique involves creating and impersonating tokens to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft:**
     - This technique involves stealing and using existing tokens to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Sednit group uses a spear-phishing email to deliver the Flash exploit, which aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - After gaining initial access, the group would likely want to escalate privileges to gain more control over the victim's machine.
     - The techniques T1134.003 (Make and Impersonate Token) and T1134.001 (Token Impersonation/Theft) are both relevant to privilege escalation.
     - Making and impersonating tokens (T1134.003) is a common method for gaining higher privileges and maintaining persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the Sednit group will make and impersonate tokens for privilege escalation to gain persistence on the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
