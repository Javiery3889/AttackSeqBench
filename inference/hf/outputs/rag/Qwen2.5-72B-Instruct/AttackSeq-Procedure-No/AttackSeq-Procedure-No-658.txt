### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the actors first run discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems. After this, it asks if it is likely that the actors started a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin before using webshells for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.005-VNC:** This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to gain remote access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to gain remote access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The initial phase of running discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems is a common first step in many cyber attacks. This helps the attackers understand the environment and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **VNC Session:** The question mentions starting a remote VNC session. VNC is a legitimate remote access tool that can be used by attackers to control a system remotely. The related TTP T1021.005-VNC confirms that VNC is a valid technique for lateral movement.
   - **Downloading a New Plugin:** The question states that the actors downloaded a new plugin before using webshells. This is a plausible step, as attackers often need to download additional tools or plugins to facilitate their activities, such as webshells for maintaining persistence and further lateral movement.
   - **Webshells for Lateral Movement:** Webshells are commonly used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system and to move laterally within a network. The sequence of using VNC to gain initial access and then using webshells for further movement is a logical progression.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the actors started a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin before using webshells for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
