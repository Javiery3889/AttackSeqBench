### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence starts with using an LNK file to execute a JavaScript file.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the JavaScript file will configure payloads to load via LD_PRELOAD for persistence before adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking (LD_PRELOAD):** This technique involves loading a shared library (e.g., via LD_PRELOAD) to execute arbitrary code when a program is run.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time.
   - **T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves using JavaScript to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **JavaScript Execution (T1059.007):** The JavaScript file is used to execute commands, which is consistent with the initial part of the attack sequence.
   - **Dynamic Linker Hijacking (T1574.006):** This technique is used to maintain persistence by loading a shared library. This is a plausible step after the initial execution to ensure the malware remains active.
   - **Scheduled Task (T1053.005):** This technique is also used for persistence by ensuring the malware runs at specific intervals. This is another plausible step after the initial execution and dynamic linker hijacking.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. LNK file execution.
     2. JavaScript file execution.
     3. Configuration of payloads to load via LD_PRELOAD.
     4. Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with the related TTPs. The JavaScript file can be used to configure the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to load a shared library, and then it can create a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
