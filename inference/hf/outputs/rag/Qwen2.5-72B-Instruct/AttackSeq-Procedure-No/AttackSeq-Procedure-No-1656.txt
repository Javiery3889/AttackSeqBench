### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack:
     - An APT phishing email was sent.
     - The email contained a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
     - The VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file.
     - The .doc file led to the execution of the malware.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an attacker using a malicious file to execute code on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:**
     - This technique involves using the cron utility to schedule tasks on Unix-like systems.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:**
     - This technique involves using the cron utility to maintain persistence on a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not install itself as a cron job using the cron utility and will likely use PowerShell instead.

   - **Context and Plausibility:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that the cron utility is a known method for both execution and persistence.
     - However, the question specifies that the malware was initially executed via a VBScript and a .doc file, which are more common in Windows environments.
     - PowerShell is a more common tool for further execution and persistence in Windows environments, whereas cron is more common in Unix-like systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the initial execution involved a VBScript and a .doc file, which are typical in Windows environments, it is less likely that the malware would switch to using the cron utility, which is more common in Unix-like systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware will not install itself as a cron job using the cron utility and will likely use PowerShell instead.

**Final Answer: B: No**
