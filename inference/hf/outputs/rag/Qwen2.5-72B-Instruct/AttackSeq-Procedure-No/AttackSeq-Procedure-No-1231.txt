### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers and execute remote commands after deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack, which aligns with the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:** This technique involves actions that prevent or impede system recovery, which also aligns with the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions the deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, which is consistent with the T1070.004 and T1490 techniques.
   - However, the question also asks if the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with C2 servers and execute remote commands **only afterwards**.
   - The related TTPs do not explicitly mention the use of backdoor malware or C2 communication. They focus on the deletion of files and inhibiting system recovery.
   - Typically, in a sophisticated attack, the use of backdoor malware and C2 communication would be part of the initial stages to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system, rather than being used only after the ransomware deployment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files is a clear tactic to prevent recovery and hide evidence.
   - The use of backdoor malware and C2 communication is a common tactic to maintain access and control over the compromised system, which is usually established before or during the initial stages of the attack.
   - The question implies that the backdoor malware and C2 communication were used only after the ransomware deployment, which is less common and less strategic in a sophisticated attack.
