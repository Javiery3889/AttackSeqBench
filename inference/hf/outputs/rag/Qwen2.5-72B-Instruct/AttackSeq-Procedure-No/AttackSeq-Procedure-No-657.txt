### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the actors first run discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems. Then, they use a Mimikatz variant to dump credentials and Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement. Finally, they use webshells for further lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using existing domain accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is a common method used by tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The question mentions running discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment.
   - **Credential Dumping:** The use of a Mimikatz variant to dump credentials aligns with the T1003.001-LSASS Memory technique. Mimikatz is a well-known tool for extracting credentials from LSASS memory.
   - **Lateral Movement with atexec:** Impacket's atexec tool is used for executing commands on remote systems, which is a form of lateral movement. This tool is often used after obtaining credentials to move through the network.
   - **Lateral Movement with Webshells:** Webshells are another method for lateral movement, often used to maintain persistence and execute commands on web servers. However, the question specifically asks if the actors used webshells only after using atexec.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. The actors first gather information, then use Mimikatz to dump credentials, and use atexec for initial lateral movement. The use of webshells for further lateral movement is also a common technique, but the question specifies that webshells are used only after atexec.
   - The related TTPs support the use of domain accounts and credential dumping, which are consistent with the described sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
