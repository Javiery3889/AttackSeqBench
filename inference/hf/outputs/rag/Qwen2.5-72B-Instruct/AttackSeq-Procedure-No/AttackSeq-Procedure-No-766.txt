### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Iranian state-backed hackers, after using phishing attacks to gain initial access, scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the target organization, which can include IP addresses, network topology, and other relevant details.
   - **T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves gathering email addresses of potential targets, which is often used in phishing attacks.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing emails to gain initial access to a target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique is relevant because it suggests that the attackers would gather detailed information about the target organization, which could include IP addresses.
   - **T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique is relevant because it indicates that the attackers are gathering email addresses, which is consistent with the use of phishing attacks.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique is directly related to the initial access method described in the question.

   Given that the attackers have already used phishing to gain initial access, it is logical that they would further refine their targeting by gathering more specific information about the target organization, including IP addresses. This would help them tailor their attacks more effectively and potentially gain deeper access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of the attack, it is likely that the attackers would scan specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
