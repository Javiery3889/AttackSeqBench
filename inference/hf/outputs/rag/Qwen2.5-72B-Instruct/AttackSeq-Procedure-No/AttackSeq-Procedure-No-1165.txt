### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM is likely to execute malicious code using Trojans and RATs after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.
   - The key points are:
     - Evasion techniques (WHOIS protection).
     - Initial access through malicious files (RTF and Excel).
     - Exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
     - Execution of malicious code using Trojans and RATs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The related TTP T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) aligns with the question's mention of gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files.
   - **Execution:**
     - The related TTP T1204.002 (Malicious File) aligns with the question's mention of executing malicious code using Trojans and RATs.
   - **Evasion:**
     - The question mentions WHOIS protection, which is a technique to hide the identity of the attacker's infrastructure. This is a common evasion technique but is not directly related to the execution or initial access techniques mentioned in the TTPs.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question (evasion, initial access, execution) is logical and aligns with the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs provided.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
