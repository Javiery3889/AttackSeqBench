### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15, including the deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) and the use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings.
   - It then asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using existing domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique involves stealing private keys, which can be used to access encrypted data or authenticate to systems.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager:** This technique involves accessing and extracting credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deployment of Backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS):** These backdoors are known to be used by APT15 for maintaining persistence and remote access.
   - **Bypassing Command Prompt Policy Settings with RoyalCLI:** This indicates that APT15 has the capability to execute commands despite policy restrictions, which is a common tactic for maintaining control over a compromised system.
   - **Using Mimikatz to Obtain Domain Administrator Credentials:** Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, particularly effective in extracting domain administrator credentials from memory or the Windows Credential Manager. This aligns with the T1555.004 technique.
   - **Stealing a VPN Certificate to Access the Network Remotely:** Stealing a VPN certificate would allow the attackers to authenticate and access the network remotely, which aligns with the T1552.004 technique for stealing private keys.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described, it is highly plausible that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely. These actions are consistent with the tactics and techniques commonly used by APT15.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
