### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an MSI package achieves persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - It then asks if it is likely that a malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker using a malicious file, such as an XLS file with a VB macro, to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.007-Msiexec:** This technique involves using the `msiexec` command to install or execute a malicious MSI package, which can help evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to download and execute a malicious MSI package.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs:
       - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** The XLS file with a VB macro is a common method to execute arbitrary code.
       - **T1218.007-Msiexec:** The VB macro can use `msiexec` to silently download and install the malicious MSI package.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malicious XLS attachment will not use a VB macro to download and execute a malicious MSI package.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as it contradicts the common use of VB macros in XLS files to execute malicious actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common attack patterns, the most plausible sequence is that the malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to silently download and execute a malicious MSI package.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
