### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after a series of specific actions: downloading and executing a malware Dropper module, exploiting Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access, and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level permissions on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions exploiting Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1190 technique, which involves exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question mentions achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956. This aligns with the T1068 technique, which involves exploiting software vulnerabilities for privilege escalation.
   - **Stager Module Notification:**
     - The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after these actions. The Stager module is typically responsible for loading and executing additional components of the malware, and it may or may not have a built-in mechanism to notify of successful exploitation. However, the question does not provide specific details about the Stager module's functionality in this context.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (downloading and executing a Dropper module, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, and achieving privilege escalation) is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - However, the question specifically asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after these actions. Without additional information about the Stager module's capabilities, it is not possible to definitively say that it will notify only after these specific actions.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence of actions described is plausible, but the specific notification behavior of the Stager module is not clearly defined in the question. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after these specific actions.
