### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Luckycat campaign is likely to use free hosting services and communicate with C&C servers using HTTP over port 80 after using WMI for persistence and defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription:**
     - This technique involves using WMI to register a script or executable to run when certain events occur, providing persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription:**
     - This technique can also be used to escalate privileges by ensuring that the script or executable runs with higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:**
     - This technique involves using WMI to execute commands or scripts, which can be used for various purposes, including persistence and defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question focuses on the use of WMI for persistence and defense evasion, which is well-supported by the related TTPs.
   - The next part of the question asks about the use of free hosting services and HTTP over port 80 for C&C communication.
   - While the related TTPs do not directly mention C&C communication or the use of free hosting services, it is common for APT groups like Luckycat to use HTTP over port 80 for C&C communication due to its commonality and ability to blend in with normal traffic.
   - Free hosting services are also a plausible choice for C&C servers because they are often free and can be easily set up and discarded, making it harder for defenders to track and block them.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common practices of APT groups and the plausibility of using free hosting services and HTTP over port 80 for C&C communication, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
