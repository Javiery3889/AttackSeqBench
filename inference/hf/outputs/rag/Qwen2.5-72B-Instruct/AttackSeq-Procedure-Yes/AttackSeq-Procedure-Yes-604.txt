### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to detect compromised Docker APIs during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.
   - The context is that the initial access was gained through misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves gaining access to a network or system by using external remote services, such as misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying malicious containers to execute code or perform other malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007-Container API:** This technique involves accessing credentials or sensitive information through the Docker API.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If attackers have already gained initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports, it is logical that they would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to further explore and confirm the compromised Docker API before deploying malicious containers.
     - DOCKERGEDDON is a tool designed to scan and exploit Docker APIs, making it a useful tool for reconnaissance in this context.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that adversaries would not use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance, which seems less plausible given the context.
     - If the initial access was gained through misconfigured Docker API ports, it is highly likely that the attackers would want to ensure they have full control and understanding of the compromised environment before deploying malicious containers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions an attacker would take, the most plausible answer is that adversaries would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
