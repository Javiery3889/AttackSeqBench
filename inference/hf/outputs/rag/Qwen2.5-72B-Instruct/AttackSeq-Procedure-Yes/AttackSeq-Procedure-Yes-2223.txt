### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an actor (Earth Lusca) uses scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and specific commands to discover open ports and services on a range of IP addresses.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the actor will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network that can be targeted for further exploitation.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services running on remote systems, which can be used to determine potential attack vectors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** The use of HUC Port Banner Scanner and the command `hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443` aligns with this technique. The actor is scanning a range of IP addresses to discover remote systems and their open ports.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** The command is specifically targeting common ports (445, 3389, 1433, 3306, 80, 443) which are associated with various network services (SMB, RDP, SQL, MySQL, HTTP, HTTPS). This aligns with the technique of discovering network services.

4. **Evaluate the Likelihood of Exploitation and Lateral Movement:**
   - **Exploiting Remote Services:** Once the actor has identified open ports and services, it is common for them to attempt to exploit these services. For example, port 445 (SMB) is often targeted for exploitation due to vulnerabilities like EternalBlue.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After gaining access to one system, the actor can use network tunnels to move laterally within the network. This is a common tactic to spread the attack and gain deeper access to the network.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the discovery of remote systems and network services, it is highly likely that the actor will attempt to exploit these services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels.
