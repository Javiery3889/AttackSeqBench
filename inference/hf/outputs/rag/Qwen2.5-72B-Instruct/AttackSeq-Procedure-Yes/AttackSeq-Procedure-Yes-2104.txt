### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers establish persistence using a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to execute a DLL function via `rundll32.exe`.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers employed anti-sandboxing techniques and dynamically resolved APIs to evade detection before gathering information about the victim's computer for discovery purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions that can help in executing malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves using time-based evasion to avoid detection by security systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The question mentions using a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to execute a DLL function via `rundll32.exe`. This aligns with the **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** technique, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Anti-sandboxing Techniques:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers employed anti-sandboxing techniques. While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, anti-sandboxing techniques are often used in conjunction with other evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Dynamically Resolved APIs:**
     - The **T1106-Native API** technique involves using native APIs, which can be dynamically resolved to perform actions. This is a common method to evade detection by security systems.
   - **Time-Based Evasion:**
     - The **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion** technique is directly mentioned in the related TTPs. This technique involves delaying the execution of malicious actions to avoid detection by sandbox environments.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After establishing persistence, it is common for attackers to use anti-sandboxing techniques and dynamically resolve APIs to evade detection. The use of time-based evasion (T1497.003) is also a logical next step to avoid detection before gathering information about the victim's computer for discovery purposes.
