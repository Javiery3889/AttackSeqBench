### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers gain initial access through phishing emails, establish backdoors, and then leverage control weaknesses in the Windows network to perform lateral movement and compromise the Enterprise Admin account to obtain full access to the infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to escalate privileges within the network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to escalate privileges, which can include domain accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through phishing emails, which aligns with the use of valid domain accounts (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) to gain initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question describes leveraging control weaknesses in the Windows network to perform lateral movement. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and can be facilitated by using valid domain accounts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question mentions compromising the Enterprise Admin account to obtain full access to the infrastructure. This aligns with the use of valid domain accounts (T1078.002-Domain Accounts and T1078-Valid Accounts) to escalate privileges and gain higher-level access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is highly likely that the attackers followed this sequence to gain and escalate their access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
