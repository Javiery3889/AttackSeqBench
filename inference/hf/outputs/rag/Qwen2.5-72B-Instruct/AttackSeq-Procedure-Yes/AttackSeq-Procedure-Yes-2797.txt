### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro, a known cyber threat, is likely to steal credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**
   - This TTP indicates that the threat actor is known to steal credentials from web browsers, which includes Google Chrome.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro will indeed steal credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting initial information.
     - The related TTP (T1555.003) supports the idea that Grandoreiro is capable of and likely to steal credentials from web browsers like Google Chrome.
     - Additionally, stealing credentials from Microsoft Outlook is a common technique in credential access, especially for financial malware like Grandoreiro, which often targets banking and financial information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro will not steal credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting initial information.
     - This choice is less likely given the related TTP and the known behavior of Grandoreiro, which often targets credentials to gain deeper access and exfiltrate sensitive information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the known behavior of Grandoreiro, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Grandoreiro will steal credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting initial information about the computer.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
