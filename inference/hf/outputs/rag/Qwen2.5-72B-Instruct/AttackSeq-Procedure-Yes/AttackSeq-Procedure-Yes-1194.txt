### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the BlackEnergy Trojan:
     - Ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.
     - The LNK file executes a command: `rundll32.exe "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT",#1` on every system boot.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the Trojan will connect to a hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80 to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves creating a LNK file in the startup folder to ensure the malware runs at every system boot.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This is a broader category that includes T1547.001 and other methods to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions creating a LNK file in the startup folder, which aligns with T1547.001 and T1547.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question asks about connecting to a C&C server using HTTP POST with BASE64-encoded data, which aligns with T1071.001.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical:
       1. Ensure persistence by creating a LNK file in the startup folder.
       2. On system boot, the LNK file executes the command.
       3. The malware then connects to the C&C server to send victim information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to its hardcoded C&C server to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
