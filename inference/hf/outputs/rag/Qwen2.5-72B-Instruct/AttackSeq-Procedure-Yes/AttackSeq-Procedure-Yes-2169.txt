### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails after using a technique in which Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad category that includes various forms of phishing.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This involves sending spear phishing emails with links that, when clicked, can lead to the execution of malicious actions.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This involves sending spear phishing emails with attachments, such as OLE2 format documents, that can execute malicious code when opened.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers would use OLE2 format documents with embedded links in spear phishing emails after using a technique to gather information about the installed software.
     - The related TTPs support the use of spear phishing with both links and attachments. The technique of using OLE2 format documents with embedded links aligns with T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link).
     - The reconnaissance step, where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software, is a plausible initial step to tailor the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, the related TTPs and the described sequence align well with known attack patterns, making this choice less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
