### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows to gain initial access and achieve privilege escalation.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application (in this case, Google Chrome) to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability (in this case, CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to gain higher privileges on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attacker exploits a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The attacker then uses CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to escalate privileges.
   - **Stager Module:**
     - A Stager module is typically used to load a small piece of code that will then download and execute a larger payload (in this case, a Dropper module).
   - **Notification:**
     - The Stager module is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It is unlikely to include a notification mechanism for successful exploitation, as this would add unnecessary complexity and increase the risk of detection.
   - **Dropper Module:**
     - The Dropper module is responsible for downloading and executing the actual malware payload. It is more likely that the Dropper module would include mechanisms to notify the attacker of successful execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is unlikely that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the Dropper module. The Stager module is typically designed to be minimal and focused on loading the next stage of the attack.

**Final Answer: B: No**
