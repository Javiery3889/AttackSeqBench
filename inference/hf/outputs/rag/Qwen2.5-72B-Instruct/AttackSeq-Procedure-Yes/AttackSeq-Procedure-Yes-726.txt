### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Rising Sun implant:
     - Initial reconnaissance to collect system and network details.
     - Communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     - Encryption of communication with RC4 and obfuscation with Base64 encoding.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the same encryption and obfuscation methods (RC4 and Base64) would be used for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding methods (like Base64) to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using various methods to deobfuscate or decode files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Rising Sun implant has already used RC4 and Base64 for initial communication with the control server. It is common for malware to use consistent methods for both command and control and data exfiltration to maintain simplicity and reduce the risk of detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the implant would use different methods for data exfiltration, which is less likely given the consistency in the initial communication methods.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of RC4 and Base64 for initial communication suggests that the implant is designed to maintain a consistent and simple communication method. This consistency helps in avoiding detection and ensures reliable communication with the control server.
   - The related TTPs (T1132.001 and T1140) further support the idea that standard encoding and deobfuscation techniques are commonly used in both command and control and data exfiltration.
