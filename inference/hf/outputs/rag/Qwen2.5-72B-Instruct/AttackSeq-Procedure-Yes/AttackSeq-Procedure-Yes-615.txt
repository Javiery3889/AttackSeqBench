### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a VBS script, after employing obfuscation and configuring itself to delete post-execution, is likely to communicate with a C&C server at a specific URL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1216.001-PubPrn**: This technique involves using the `pubprn.vbs` script to execute arbitrary commands, which can be used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBS) scripts to execute commands on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation and Self-Deletion**: The VBS script is obfuscated to evade detection and is configured to delete itself after execution. This is a common tactic to avoid leaving traces on the system, which aligns with the defense evasion tactic.
   - **Communication with C&C Server**: The question specifically asks about communication with a C&C server. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention C&C communication, it is a common next step in many attack sequences after initial execution and defense evasion.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion**: The use of obfuscation and self-deletion is a strong indicator of an attempt to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Execution**: The use of VBS scripts for execution is a common method in many attack scenarios.
   - **C&C Communication**: While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a logical next step for an attacker to establish communication with a C&C server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server after performing the initial defense evasion and execution steps.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
