### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Babar, after achieving persistence by creating a registry key to execute its DLL at system boot, is likely to capture screenshots of desktop applications as part of its collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection**
   - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the user's screen, which can include desktop applications, to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Key:**
     - Babar has achieved persistence by creating a registry key to execute its DLL at system boot. This ensures that the malware is active every time the system starts.
   - **Collection via Screen Capture:**
     - The related TTP (T1113-Screen Capture) indicates that capturing the contents of the user's screen is a common technique used in the Collection tactic. This technique is often employed to gather sensitive information, such as user activities, documents, and other visual data.
   - **Likelihood of Screen Capture:**
     - Given that Babar has already established persistence, it is logical for the malware to engage in collection activities to gather valuable information. Screen capture is a common and effective method for collecting such information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of the attack, it is likely that Babar will capture screenshots of desktop applications as part of its collection activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
