### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Emissary Panda used stolen credentials for lateral movement after performing network reconnaissance and before employing the HyperBro backdoor for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using various remote services to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This sub-technique specifically involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Network Reconnaissance:** The question mentions that Emissary Panda used tools for network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Stolen Credentials for Lateral Movement:** The question asks if Emissary Panda used stolen credentials for lateral movement. The related TTPs (T1021, T1021.002, and T1570) all support the use of remote services and SMB for lateral movement, which often involves the use of stolen credentials.
   - **HyperBro Backdoor for Command and Control:** The question mentions that the HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control after lateral movement. This is a logical sequence, as once an attacker has moved laterally within the network, they can establish a backdoor for persistent access and control.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (network reconnaissance, lateral movement using stolen credentials, and then employing the HyperBro backdoor) aligns well with the related TTPs and is a common attack pattern.

### Final Answer
