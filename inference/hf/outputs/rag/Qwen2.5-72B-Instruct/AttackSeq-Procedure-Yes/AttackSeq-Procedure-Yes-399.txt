### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the execution of the Gholee malware through a specific method (concatenated PE file NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32).
   - It asks whether it is likely that the malware will use obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection before establishing a secure command-and-control (C2) connection using an expired digital certificate.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using a digital certificate to sign malware, which can help it appear legitimate and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:**
     - This technique involves using the Rundll32 utility to execute code, which can be used to evade detection by masquerading as a legitimate system process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation and Hiding from Sandboxes:**
     - Malware often uses obfuscation techniques to hide its true nature and evade detection by security software, including sandboxes. This is a common practice in the malware lifecycle.
   - **Using an Expired Digital Certificate:**
     - The use of an expired digital certificate is a form of code signing (T1553.002). While an expired certificate may not be as effective as a valid one, it can still be used to make the malware appear more legitimate to some extent.
   - **Establishing a Secure C2 Connection:**
     - Establishing a secure C2 connection is a common goal for malware to maintain communication with the attacker. Using an expired certificate for this purpose is less common but not unheard of, especially if the malware is trying to blend in with legitimate traffic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the malware will use obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection. The use of an expired digital certificate for code signing (T1553.002) and the use of Rundll32 (T1218.011) are both consistent with the described attack sequence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware will indeed employ these techniques.

### Final Answer
