### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will ensure persistence within the target network before using increased privileges to spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - Execution of malicious code.
     - Ensuring persistence.
     - Using increased privileges to spread or gain access to strategic goals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using local accounts to maintain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a system through a user visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying local accounts to maintain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - This technique is used to gain initial access to a system, which aligns with the execution of malicious code.
   - **Persistence (T1078.003-Local Accounts and T1136.001-Local Account):**
     - These techniques are used to ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the system over time, which is a common next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Using Increased Privileges:**
     - After ensuring persistence, attackers often escalate privileges to gain more control over the system and spread to other systems or achieve strategic goals.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access to the system through a drive-by compromise (T1189).
     2. **Persistence:** The attacker ensures persistence by creating or using local accounts (T1078.003 and T1136.001).
     3. **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:** After ensuring persistence, the attacker may then escalate privileges and spread to other systems or achieve strategic goals.
