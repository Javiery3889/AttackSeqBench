### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase.
   - Key points:
     - FIN13 has already exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     - The question focuses on the Reconnaissance phase and the subsequent Execution phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves deploying web shells to maintain persistent access to a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:**
     - This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The question mentions the Reconnaissance phase, which is typically the initial stage where threat actors gather information about the target network.
     - The related TTP T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) is a key technique used during the Reconnaissance phase to gather network information.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The question also mentions the Execution phase, where threat actors use tools like JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.
     - The related TTP T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell) is a technique used during the Execution phase to execute commands on the victim's system.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack lifecycle:
       1. **Initial Access:** Deploying web shells and custom malware (T1505.003).
       2. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering network information (T1016).
       3. **Execution:** Using JSPRAT for command execution and network traffic proxying (T1059.003).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the typical attack lifecycle, it is likely that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
