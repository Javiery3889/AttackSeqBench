### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the WINDSHIFT APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information.
     - Employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents.
     - Sending benign daily emails duplicating local media content to build a relationship with the target.
     - Tracking interactions via domains like Wasmyemailread[.]com and ifread[.]com.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves creating and using email accounts to support operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing via a service (e.g., social media, email) to gain initial access to a target.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:**
     - This technique involves creating and using social media accounts to support operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that WINDSHIFT APT will send benign daily emails to build a relationship and track interactions.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** Creating and using social media accounts to gather information and build trust.
       - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** Using spearphishing via social media to gain initial access.
       - **T1585.002-Email Accounts:** Creating and using email accounts to send benign emails and track interactions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that WINDSHIFT APT will not send benign daily emails to build a relationship and track interactions.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate a sequence of actions that includes building trust and tracking interactions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that WINDSHIFT APT will send benign daily emails to build a relationship and track interactions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
