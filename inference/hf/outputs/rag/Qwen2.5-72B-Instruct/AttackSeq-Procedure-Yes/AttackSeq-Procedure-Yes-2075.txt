### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising:**
     - This technique involves using malicious advertisements to distribute malware. Malvertising can redirect users to malicious websites or exploit kits.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, often to download and run malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to users who visit the site, often through exploit kits.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the RIG EK uses malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites, and then runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs:
       - **T1583.008-Malvertising:** Malvertising is used to redirect users to malicious content.
       - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** The compromised websites or advertising pages are used to deliver the exploit kit.
       - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** The exploit kit uses PowerShell to execute the final payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as the TTPs clearly describe a sequence that matches the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
