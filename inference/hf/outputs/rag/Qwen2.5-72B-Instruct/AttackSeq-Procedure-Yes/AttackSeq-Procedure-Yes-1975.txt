### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use phishing emails from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain to gain initial access after exploiting vulnerabilities in remote desktop protocols (RDP) during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting RDP Vulnerabilities for Reconnaissance:**
     - Exploiting RDP vulnerabilities is a common initial access technique. Once the attackers gain access, they can perform reconnaissance to understand the network and identify potential targets.
   - **Using Phishing Emails from Genuine Accounts:**
     - Phishing emails from genuine accounts (T1566) are a common method for gaining initial access. If the attackers have already compromised a genuine account (T1078), they can use it to send phishing emails to other targets within the network or supply chain.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After gaining initial access, attackers often use techniques like internal spearphishing (T1534) to move laterally within the network and gain deeper access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After exploiting RDP vulnerabilities for reconnaissance, attackers can use compromised valid accounts to send phishing emails to other targets within the supply chain. This can help them gain initial access to additional systems, which they can then use to exfiltrate sensitive data during ransomware attacks.
