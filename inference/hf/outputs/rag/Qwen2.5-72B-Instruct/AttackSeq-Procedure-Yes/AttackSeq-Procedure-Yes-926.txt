### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to use a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control (C2) operations through application layer protocols after spreading laterally through the network or via USB devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to spread malware across a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using Server Message Block (SMB) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over compromised systems, often through application layer protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations is consistent with the T1104 technique (Multi-Stage Channels). This technique suggests that the attackers use multiple stages of communication to maintain control, which can include application layer protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the Volatile Cedar campaign does not use a sophisticated C2 infrastructure, which seems less likely given the context of the related TTPs.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Volatile Cedar campaign uses sophisticated techniques for lateral movement (T1091 and T1021.002) and command and control (T1104). The use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations aligns well with the T1104 technique, which involves multi-stage communication channels.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Volatile Cedar campaign would leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations through application layer protocols.
