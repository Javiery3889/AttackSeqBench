### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TDrop2 malware is likely to communicate with C2 servers using an encrypted channel after performing discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications, making it harder for defenders to detect or disrupt the communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves the malware collecting information about network connections, which is a common discovery activity.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which is often encrypted to protect the data in transit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The presence of T1573 (Encrypted Channel) in the related TTPs strongly suggests that the malware is likely to use encrypted communication for C2. This is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the malware does not use encrypted communication, which is less likely given the presence of T1573 in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, particularly T1573 (Encrypted Channel), it is highly likely that TDrop2 malware will communicate with C2 servers using an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
