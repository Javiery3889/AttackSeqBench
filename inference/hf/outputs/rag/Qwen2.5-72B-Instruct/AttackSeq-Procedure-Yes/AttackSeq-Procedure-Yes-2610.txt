### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
     - They deliver a Flash exploit "flash_video_x86.swf" via a spear-phishing email.
     - They establish the victim's machine as a valid target.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will use the resulting malware to:
     - Utilize an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit.
     - Enable persistence on the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Privilege Escalation
     - **Technique:** T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
   - This indicates that the group is likely to use an exploit to gain higher privileges on the victim's machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the group will use the malware to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability and enable persistence.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is a plausible sequence. The technique T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) aligns with the group's likely actions after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the group will not use the malware to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability or enable persistence.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced threat groups like Sednit, which often seek to maintain long-term access to compromised systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Sednit group will use the resulting malware to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability and enable persistence on the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
