### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where adversaries use phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments to gain initial access. Once the employees enable macros, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will establish a connection to a C2 server before performing internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique describes the use of spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through spearphishing with weaponized MS Office attachments (T1566.001). Once the attachment is opened and macros are enabled, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - After the malware is installed, it typically needs to establish a connection to a C2 server to receive further instructions. This is a common behavior for malware to ensure it can receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance and Credential Harvesting:**
     - Once the C2 connection is established, the malware can then perform internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting. These actions are often part of the post-exploitation phase and are typically initiated by commands from the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware like BlackEnergy 3, it is highly likely that the malware will establish a connection to a C2 server before performing internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting. This is because the C2 server is necessary to receive commands and coordinate further actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
