### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a backdoor, after stealing Google Chrome credentials, is likely to ping the C2 (Command and Control) server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types (doc, docx, pdf) to the same server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include credentials, files, and other sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating collected data over the C2 channel, which is the communication channel used by the malware to send data back to the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will not ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique is relevant to the collection of data, including Google Chrome credentials and targeted file types (doc, docx, pdf).
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique is relevant to the exfiltration of the collected data over the C2 channel.
   - **Regular Pinging of C2 Server:**
     - Regular pinging of the C2 server is a common tactic used by malware to maintain a persistent connection and to ensure that the C2 server is available before attempting to exfiltrate data. This helps in maintaining a reliable communication channel and can also be used to receive commands from the attacker.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - After stealing Google Chrome credentials, the backdoor is likely to ping the C2 server to ensure the connection is active and to receive any further commands or instructions.
     - Once the connection is established and confirmed, the backdoor will proceed to collect and exfiltrate the targeted file types (doc, docx, pdf) over the C2 channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
