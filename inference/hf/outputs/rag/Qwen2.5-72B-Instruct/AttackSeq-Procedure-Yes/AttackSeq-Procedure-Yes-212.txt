### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will communicate with C&C servers hosted on Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront using an encrypted channel after the custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1113-Screen Capture, which is part of the Collection tactic. This technique involves capturing screenshots from a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique is used to capture screenshots from the victim's system. Once the screenshots are captured, they need to be exfiltrated to the attacker's C&C server.
   - **Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon:** These are tools used for maintaining persistence and command and control (C2) communication. They are often designed to communicate with C&C servers in a stealthy manner to avoid detection.
   - **C&C Servers on Microsoft Infrastructure and CloudFront:** Using legitimate cloud services like Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront for C&C servers is a common tactic to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Encrypted Channel:** Modern C2 communication often uses encrypted channels to protect the data in transit and to avoid detection by network security tools.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After capturing and archiving screenshots, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the data to the C&C server.
   - Both Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon are sophisticated tools that are likely to use encrypted channels for communication to maintain stealth and security.
   - Using C&C servers hosted on legitimate cloud services like Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront is a common tactic to avoid raising suspicion and to blend in with normal network traffic.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
