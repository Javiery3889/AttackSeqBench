### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to leverage shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims, exploiting systems that share access and credentials.
   - The context involves internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and later stages using open-source pentesting tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using Server Message Block (SMB) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network. It is a common method for accessing and controlling remote systems.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement. This can include transferring malware, scripts, or other tools to execute on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT10's Known TTPs:**
     - APT10 is known for using a variety of techniques to move laterally within a network, including leveraging shared infrastructure and exploiting weak or shared credentials.
     - They often use SMB and Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002) to gain access to remote systems.
     - They also transfer tools and malware to remote systems (T1570) to facilitate further movement and control.
   - **Shared MSP Infrastructure:**
     - MSPs often manage multiple clients and may have shared infrastructure, which can be a single point of entry for attackers.
     - APT10 has been known to target MSPs to gain access to their clients, leveraging the shared infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Exploiting Shared Access and Credentials:**
     - APT10 frequently exploits weak or shared credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems.
     - This aligns with the use of SMB and Windows Admin Shares, as these protocols often rely on credentials for authentication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of APT10, their history of targeting MSPs, and their use of SMB and tool transfer techniques, it is highly likely that APT10 would leverage shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally and exploit systems with shared access and credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
