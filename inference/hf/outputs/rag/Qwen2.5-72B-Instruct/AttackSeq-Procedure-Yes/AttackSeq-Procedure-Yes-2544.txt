### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Milestone backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 (Command and Control) channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen on the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Exfiltration
     - **Technique:** T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the adversary using the established C2 channel to exfiltrate data from the compromised system. This is a common method for adversaries to send stolen data back to their servers.
   - **Discovery and Screen Capture:** The question mentions that the Milestone backdoor has already discovered system information and captured the screen. These actions are typically part of the reconnaissance and data collection phases of an attack.
   - **Logical Sequence:** After discovering system information and capturing the screen, it is logical for the backdoor to exfiltrate the collected data. The C2 channel is a common and efficient method for this exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is highly likely that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate the data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
