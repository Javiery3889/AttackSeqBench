### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the BlueDelta campaign likely exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then conducted discovery activities to gather system and network configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network or system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the BlueDelta campaign did exploit the Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then conducted discovery activities.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The related TTP (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) aligns with the scenario described in the question. Roundcube is a public-facing webmail application, and CVE-2020-35730 is a known vulnerability in such applications.
       - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to conduct discovery activities to gather information about the system and network configurations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the BlueDelta campaign did not exploit the Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and did not conduct discovery activities.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTP (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application), which suggests that exploiting a public-facing application is a plausible method for initial access.
       - It also does not account for the typical follow-up actions of conducting discovery activities after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the alignment with the related TTP and the typical sequence of attack activities, the most plausible answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
