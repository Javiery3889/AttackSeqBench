### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SideTwist backdoor, which was set up to run every 5 minutes via a scheduled task, communicated with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence. The task is named 'SystemFailureReporter' and is set to execute the SideTwist payload every 5 minutes.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:**
     - This technique involves setting up a scheduled transfer of data to a remote location, which is often used for exfiltration. The data transfer is likely to be periodic, aligning with the scheduled task.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):**
     - The scheduled task is used to ensure that the SideTwist payload runs every 5 minutes, maintaining persistence on the compromised system.
   - **Exfiltration (T1029-Scheduled Transfer):**
     - The periodic nature of the scheduled task suggests that the SideTwist backdoor is likely to communicate with the C&C server at regular intervals to exfiltrate data or receive commands.
   - **Encrypted HTTP Channels:**
     - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention encryption, it is common for sophisticated malware like SideTwist to use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophistication of the SideTwist backdoor and the common practice of using encrypted channels for C&C communication, it is likely that the SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
