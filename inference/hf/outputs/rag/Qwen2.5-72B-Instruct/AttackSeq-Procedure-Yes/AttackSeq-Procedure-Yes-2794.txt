### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro, a known malware, is likely to collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, after employing techniques to evade detection and emulation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves the malware checking for the presence of virtual environments or sandboxes to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001 - System Checks:** This sub-technique involves the malware performing checks to determine the system environment, which can include identifying the operating system and security products.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer after employing evasion techniques.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is used to avoid detection, which is a common step before performing further actions like information collection.
       - **T1497.001 - System Checks:** This sub-technique directly involves collecting information about the system, including operating system details and security products.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Grandoreiro will not collect information about the victim's computer after employing evasion techniques.
     - The related TTPs do not support this choice:
       - The techniques listed are specifically designed to help the malware understand the environment and avoid detection, which typically precedes information collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions a malware like Grandoreiro would take, the most plausible answer is that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer after employing evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
