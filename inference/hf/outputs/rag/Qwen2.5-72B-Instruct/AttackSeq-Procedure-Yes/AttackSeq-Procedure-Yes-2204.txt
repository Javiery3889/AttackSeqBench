### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan during the Discovery phase.
     - Collecting data from local systems and network shared drives during the Collection phase.
     - Compressing the collected data using WinRAR.
     - Exfiltrating the data using the megacmd tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:**
     - This technique involves compressing data using utilities like WinRAR.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from local systems.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves archiving collected data, which is a broader category that includes T1560.001.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan is consistent with the Discovery phase, where threat actors gather information about the network and systems.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Collecting data from local systems and network shared drives aligns with the T1005 technique.
   - **Data Compression:**
     - Compressing the collected data using WinRAR aligns with the T1560.001 technique.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Using the megacmd tool for exfiltration is a plausible next step after data collection and compression.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs and follows a logical progression of actions in a cyber attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Earth Lusca will indeed collect data from local systems and network shared drives, compress it using WinRAR, and exfiltrate it using the megacmd tool.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
