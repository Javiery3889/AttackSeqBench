### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections after collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data at regular intervals.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automatic collection of data from various sources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Automated Collection (T1119):** This TTP aligns with the initial part of the question where files are collected from application and data directories.
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):** This TTP aligns with the automatic exfiltration of files at regular intervals.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** This TTP aligns with the use of a C2 channel for exfiltration, which could include a Tor hidden service.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.
     - The related TTPs support the idea of automated exfiltration and exfiltration over a C2 channel, which could include a Tor hidden service.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This answer suggests that Infamous Chisel is not likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.
     - This answer does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate automated exfiltration and exfiltration over a C2 channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
