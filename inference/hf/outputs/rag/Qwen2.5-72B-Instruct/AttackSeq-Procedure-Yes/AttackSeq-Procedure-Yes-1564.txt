### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ChChes, after establishing communication with C&C servers using HTTP cookie headers for defense evasion, is likely to communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with C&C servers. HTTP cookie headers can be used to evade detection by blending in with normal web traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to avoid detection. Using HTTP cookie headers for communication is a form of protocol impersonation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ChChes will indeed communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after establishing communication using HTTP cookie headers (T1071.001 and T1001.003), the malware would continue to use this channel to receive further commands and modules.
     - Malware often uses encrypted communication to further evade detection and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data being exchanged.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ChChes will not communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, as the initial communication using HTTP cookie headers is already a form of defense evasion and protocol impersonation, which are common tactics for establishing and maintaining C&C communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely answer is that ChChes will communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
