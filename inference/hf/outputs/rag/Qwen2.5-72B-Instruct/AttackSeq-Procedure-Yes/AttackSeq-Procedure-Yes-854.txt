### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG-3279 will perform a sequence of actions:
     - Perform reconnaissance via open source research and network scanning.
     - Clone domain registration information from legitimate companies like Google or Microsoft.
     - Gain initial access using tools such as 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the target's network, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:**
     - This technique involves searching public databases for technical information about the target, which also aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:**
     - This technique involves acquiring or registering domains to support the attack, which could include cloning domain registration information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The related TTPs T1590 and T1596 clearly support the reconnaissance phase described in the question.
   - **Cloning Domain Registration Information:**
     - The related TTP T1583.001 supports the idea of acquiring or registering domains, which could include cloning domain registration information.
   - **Gaining Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets. While these specific tools are not mentioned in the related TTPs, the general idea of using tools to gain initial access is a common next step after reconnaissance and resource development.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that TG-3279 would perform these actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
