### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Vyveva's backdoor will encrypt C&C (Command and Control) traffic using the XOR operation after compressing files with zlib during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or data to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data using a custom method, which in this case is zlib.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compression (T1560.003):** The backdoor compresses files using zlib during the Collection phase. This is a common technique to reduce the size of data before exfiltration.
   - **Encryption (T1027.013):** The question asks about encrypting C&C traffic using the XOR operation. XOR is a simple and lightweight encryption method that can be used to obfuscate data.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of XOR Encryption:**
     - XOR is a simple and effective method for basic encryption, often used in malware to obfuscate data and evade detection.
     - Given that the backdoor already uses zlib for compression, it is plausible that it would also use a simple encryption method like XOR to further obfuscate the C&C traffic.
     - The related TTP T1027.013 (Encrypted/Encoded File) supports the idea that the backdoor might use encryption to evade detection.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of XOR in malware for obfuscation, it is likely that the backdoor would encrypt C&C traffic using the XOR operation.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
