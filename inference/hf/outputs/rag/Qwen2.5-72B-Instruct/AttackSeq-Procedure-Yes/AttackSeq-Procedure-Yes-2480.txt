### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spear phishing emails containing a malicious attachment that exploits CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control (C2) servers during the resource development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. However, the question specifically mentions spear phishing with a malicious attachment, which is more aligned with T1566 (Phishing).
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:**
     - This technique involves acquiring domains to support future operations, such as setting up C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:**
     - This technique is similar to T1583.001 and involves registering or leasing domains to use in various stages of an attack, including C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did acquire domains for C2 purposes. Given the related TTPs T1583.001 and T1584.001, which both involve acquiring domains for future operations, this choice aligns well with the resource development phase of the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not acquire domains for C2 purposes. However, this does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that acquiring domains is a common practice in the resource development phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack stages, it is likely that the attackers acquired domains to serve as C2 servers during the resource development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
