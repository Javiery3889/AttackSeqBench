### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the NanHaiShu malware:
     - Gathering system information from the infected machine.
     - Uploading this information to the C&C server.
     - Using dynamic DNS providers to communicate with the C&C server.
     - Switching from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware gathering information about the network configuration of the infected machine, which is consistent with the first part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS for communication with the C&C server, which aligns with the use of dynamic DNS providers mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed use dynamic DNS providers to communicate with the C&C server and switch from U.S. to Chinese IP addresses.
     - The related TTPs support the use of DNS for C&C communication (T1071.004) and the gathering of system information (T1016).
     - Dynamic DNS providers are commonly used by malware to maintain communication with C&C servers, especially when the IP addresses of the servers need to change frequently.
     - Switching from U.S. to Chinese IP addresses is a plausible strategy to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use dynamic DNS providers or switch IP addresses.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as it does not align with the use of DNS for C&C communication or the need to gather system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
