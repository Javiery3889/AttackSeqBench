### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will use scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory before achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.
   - The key points are:
     - The adversary has already obtained access through compromised remote services.
     - The adversary is using scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon.
     - The adversary is targeting systems with high uptimes for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services (like VPN or Citrix) to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The adversary has already gained access through compromised remote services (T1133).
   - **Execution:**
     - The adversary is using scheduled tasks (T1053.005) to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The adversary is targeting systems with high uptimes (like servers) to achieve persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The adversary first gains access through compromised remote services.
     - Once inside the network, the adversary uses scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.
     - To ensure long-term access, the adversary targets systems with high uptimes (like servers) to achieve persistence.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is common for adversaries to use scheduled tasks to execute their payloads and maintain persistence.
     - Targeting systems with high uptimes is a strategic move to ensure the beacon remains active and the adversary can maintain control over the network.
