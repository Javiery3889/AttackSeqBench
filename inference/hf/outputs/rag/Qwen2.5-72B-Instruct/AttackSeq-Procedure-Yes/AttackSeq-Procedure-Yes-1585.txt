### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the T9000 malware.
   - The sequence starts with the malware exploiting an RTF file to deliver a multi-stage shellcode process.
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to use DLL sideloading with a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll) through a legitimate executable (igfxtray.exe), followed by setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves loading a DLL into every user-mode process by adding it to the AppInit_DLLs registry value.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves executing a malicious DLL by loading it through a legitimate executable that is configured to load a DLL from a specific location.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** The question mentions that the malware uses a legitimate executable (igfxtray.exe) to load a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll). This aligns with the DLL Side-Loading technique.
   - **AppInit DLLs (T1546.010):** The question also mentions setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence. This aligns with the AppInit DLLs technique, as it involves loading a DLL into every user-mode process by modifying the registry.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (exploiting an RTF file, using DLL sideloading, setting registry keys, and injecting a DLL into explorer.exe) is consistent with the related TTPs provided.
   - Both DLL Side-Loading and AppInit DLLs are techniques used for persistence, which is a common goal for malware like T9000.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
