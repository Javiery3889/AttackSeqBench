### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Earth Lusca targeted user credentials using specific tools and techniques.
   - The tools and techniques mentioned are:
     - **procdump** to dump the **lsass** process memory.
     - Retrieval of credential hashes.
     - Leveraging valid code-signed executions and obfuscation techniques.
     - Deploying containers for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1003.001 - LSASS Memory**
   - This TTP indicates that the attacker is using a technique to access credentials by dumping the memory of the **lsass** process, which is a common method for extracting credential hashes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **procdump** is a legitimate tool that can be used to dump the memory of processes, including the **lsass** process.
   - **T1003.001 - LSASS Memory** aligns with the use of **procdump** to extract credential hashes from the **lsass** process.
   - The question also mentions leveraging valid code-signed executions and obfuscation techniques, which are common in advanced attacks to evade detection.
   - Deploying containers for defense evasion is a sophisticated technique that can be used to isolate malicious activities and avoid detection by security tools.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (using **procdump** to dump **lsass** memory, retrieving credential hashes, and using code-signed executions and obfuscation techniques) is consistent with the related TTPs provided.
   - The use of containers for defense evasion is a plausible next step after gaining access to credentials, as it helps in maintaining persistence and evading detection.

### Final Answer:
**A: Yes**
