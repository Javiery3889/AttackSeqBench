### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious macro in an MS Office document downloads the RMS tool and supporting scripts.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the threat actors will achieve persistence by adding a 'Microtik' string value to the registry and launching the RMS executable before attempting to kill the 'rundll32.exe' process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:**
     - This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute code, which can be used to evade defenses.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves adding a registry run key or startup folder entry to ensure that a program is executed when the system boots or a user logs in.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Adding a 'Microtik' string value to the registry:**
     - This aligns with the T1547.001 technique, which involves adding a registry run key to achieve persistence.
   - **Launching the RMS executable:**
     - This is a logical step after adding the registry key to ensure the RMS tool runs at startup.
   - **Killing the 'rundll32.exe' process:**
     - This is less common and does not align with the typical use of T1218.011. Typically, threat actors use rundll32.exe to execute code, not to kill it.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (adding a registry key for persistence and launching the RMS executable) is plausible and aligns with the T1547.001 technique.
   - However, the step of killing the 'rundll32.exe' process is not typical and does not align with the T1218.011 technique, which is more about using rundll32.exe to execute code.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The sequence described, particularly the step of killing the 'rundll32.exe' process, is not typical and does not align with the related TTPs. Therefore, it is not likely that the threat actors will follow this specific sequence.
