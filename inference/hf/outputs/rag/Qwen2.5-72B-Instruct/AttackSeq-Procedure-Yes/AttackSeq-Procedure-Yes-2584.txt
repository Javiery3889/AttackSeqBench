### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware communicates with the identified C&C servers using application layer protocols after discovering system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C&C) communication.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of protocols that are not typically used for application layer communication (e.g., ICMP, DNS).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware uses application layer protocols for C&C communication.
     - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols supports this choice, as it specifically mentions the use of web protocols, which are application layer protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware does not use application layer protocols for C&C communication.
     - The related TTP T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol supports this choice, as it mentions the use of non-application layer protocols.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question states that the malware has already discovered system information such as the hostname, user details, and active TCP connections. This suggests that the malware is in a position to establish a more sophisticated communication channel.
   - Given the context, it is more likely that the malware would use application layer protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) for C&C communication, as these protocols are more common and can blend in with normal network traffic, making them less likely to be detected.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
