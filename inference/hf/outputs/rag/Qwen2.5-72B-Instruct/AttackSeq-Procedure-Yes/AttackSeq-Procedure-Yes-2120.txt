### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether A41APT attackers, after executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader, are likely to perform software discovery using WMIC before heavily utilizing RDP for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using valid accounts and remote services, such as RDP, to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC):** This technique involves using WMIC to execute commands and scripts, which can be used for various purposes, including software discovery and system enumeration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading with DESLoader:** This is a method to execute malicious code without writing it to disk, often used to evade detection.
   - **Software Discovery using WMIC:** WMIC can be used to gather information about the system, including installed software, which can help attackers understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement using RDP:** RDP is a common method for attackers to move between systems within a network, especially after gaining initial access and performing reconnaissance.

   Given the sequence described:
   - **Step 1:** The attackers execute fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader.
   - **Step 2:** They perform software discovery using WMIC to gather information about the environment.
   - **Step 3:** They use RDP for lateral movement to target additional servers.

   The sequence is logical because:
   - After gaining initial access and executing the fileless implant, the attackers would likely want to understand the environment they are in.
   - Using WMIC for software discovery helps them identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
   - Once they have this information, they can use RDP to move laterally and target additional servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the A41APT attackers will perform software discovery using WMIC before heavily utilizing RDP for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
