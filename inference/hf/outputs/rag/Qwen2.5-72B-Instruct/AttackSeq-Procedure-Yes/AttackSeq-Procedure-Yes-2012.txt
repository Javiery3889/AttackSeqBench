### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Welcome Chat app:
     - Ensures persistence by auto-starting at device boot through the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast.
     - Collects device information and GPS location for discovery.
     - Asks if it is likely that the app uploads exfiltrated data to its C&C server using the HTTP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. Common protocols used for this include HTTP, HTTPS, and other network protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast):**
     - Ensuring persistence by auto-starting at device boot is a common tactic to maintain long-term access to the device.
   - **Data Collection (device information and GPS location):**
     - Collecting device information and GPS location is typical for reconnaissance and data exfiltration purposes.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - The related TTP T1041 specifically mentions exfiltration over the same channel used for C2 communications. HTTP is a common protocol used for both C2 and exfiltration due to its widespread use and ability to blend in with normal traffic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTP T1041, it is highly likely that the app would use HTTP to exfiltrate data to its C&C server. This aligns with the common practice of using the same channel for both C2 and exfiltration to avoid detection and maintain a low profile.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
