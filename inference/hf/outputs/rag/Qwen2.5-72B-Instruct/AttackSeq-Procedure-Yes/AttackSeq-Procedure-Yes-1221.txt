### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers compress proprietary data using WinRAR (a utility) and then exfiltrate the files to Dropbox using custom malware and cURL for Windows.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves using built-in or third-party utilities to compress data. WinRAR is an example of such a utility.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, such as Dropbox.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves using custom methods to compress data, which is different from using a utility like WinRAR.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files.
     - The related TTPs support the use of a utility (WinRAR) for archiving and exfiltration to cloud storage (Dropbox). However, the use of custom malware is not directly supported by the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is not likely.
     - The related TTPs do not explicitly mention the use of custom malware for exfiltration. They only mention the use of a utility for archiving and exfiltration to cloud storage.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs support the use of a utility (WinRAR) for archiving and exfiltration to cloud storage (Dropbox). However, they do not provide evidence for the use of custom malware in the exfiltration process.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question, which includes the use of custom malware, is not fully supported by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
