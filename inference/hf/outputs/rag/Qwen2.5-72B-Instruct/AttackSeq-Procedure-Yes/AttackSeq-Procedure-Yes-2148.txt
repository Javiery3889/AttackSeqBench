### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the FlowCloud macro renames files and executes `gup.exe` using a version of `certutil.exe` (Temptcm.tmp).
   - It then asks if it is likely that `gup.exe` will execute `EhStorAuthn.exe` to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves renaming malicious files to match legitimate names to avoid detection.
   - **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell (Execution):** This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Persistence):** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malicious code runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Renaming Files (T1036.005):** The FlowCloud macro renames files to match legitimate names, which aligns with the T1036.005 technique.
   - **Executing `gup.exe` using `certutil.exe` (T1059.003):** The use of `certutil.exe` to execute `gup.exe` is a common technique for executing commands and scripts, which aligns with T1059.003.
   - **Extracting and Installing Payload for Persistence (T1547):** The question mentions that `gup.exe` will execute `EhStorAuthn.exe` to extract and install payload file components for persistence. This aligns with the T1547 technique, which involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malicious code runs automatically.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (renaming files, executing `gup.exe` using `certutil.exe`, and then using `gup.exe` to execute `EhStorAuthn.exe` for persistence) is consistent with the related TTPs.
   - The use of `EhStorAuthn.exe` to extract and install payload file components for persistence is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
