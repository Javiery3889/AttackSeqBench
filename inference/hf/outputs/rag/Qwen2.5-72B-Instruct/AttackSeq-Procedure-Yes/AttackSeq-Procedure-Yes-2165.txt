### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the NetTraveler malware:
     - Ensuring persistence by registering a C&C module as a service.
     - Using mutexes to prevent multiple instances.
     - Potentially using a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration and reveal C&C servers through decryption.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion:**
     - This technique involves using mutexes to prevent multiple instances of the malware from running, which aligns with the described use of "SD_2013 Is Running!".
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to maintain persistence, which aligns with the described registration of "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" as a service named "Windowsupdata".
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files, which aligns with the potential use of a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate the configuration and C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration and reveal C&C servers through decryption.
     - The related TTP T1027.013 (Encrypted/Encoded File) directly supports this idea, as it is a common technique used to evade detection and protect sensitive information like C&C server addresses.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the NetTraveler malware will not use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1027.013, which indicates that encryption is a common method for obfuscation in malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in malware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration and reveal C&C servers through decryption.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
