### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that A41APT attackers, after gaining initial access, executed malicious code through DESLoader using DLL side-loading techniques before conducting discovery activities using WMIC and deploying tools to find domain accounts and trust relationships.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, such as SSL-VPNs, to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers gained initial access by exploiting SSL-VPN vulnerabilities or using stolen credentials, which aligns with T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers used DLL side-loading techniques to execute malicious code through DESLoader. This aligns with T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, which is listed under both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The question mentions conducting discovery activities using WMIC and deploying tools to find domain accounts and trust relationships. While the specific techniques for these activities are not listed in the Related TTPs, it is common for attackers to use WMIC for discovery after gaining initial access and executing malicious code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the provided TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that the A41APT attackers followed this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
