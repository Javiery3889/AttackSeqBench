### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign is likely to monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data after capturing credentials from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, such as credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of keylogging in the context of credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):** The related TTPs focus on keylogging, which is a method to capture keystrokes and collect credentials. This technique is effective for capturing usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information entered via the keyboard.
   - **Automated Collection (T1119):** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, which can include a variety of methods such as logging, scraping, and monitoring.
   - **Monitoring Documents Sent to the Printer:** The question specifically asks about monitoring documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data. This is a different method of data collection that is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs emphasize keylogging and automated collection, which are methods for capturing data entered via the keyboard or collected through automated tools. Monitoring documents sent to the printer is a more specific and less common method of data collection.
   - While it is possible for malware to monitor documents sent to the printer, the related TTPs do not provide evidence to support this specific method. The focus is on keylogging and automated collection, which are more aligned with the described activities of capturing credentials and selling them to other cybercriminals.

### Final Answer:
B: No
