### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials and relies on Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of C2 traffic.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This suggests that FIN4 might use DNS for C2 communication, which is a common method for maintaining stealth and evading detection.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This indicates that FIN4 might use multiple proxies to further obfuscate their C2 traffic, making it harder to trace back to the attackers.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This suggests that FIN4 might use symmetric cryptography to encrypt their C2 communications, ensuring that the data is not easily intercepted.

   - **Tor Usage:**
     - The question specifically asks about the use of Tor for anonymous communication. However, none of the related TTPs mention Tor. Tor is a well-known tool for anonymous communication, but the absence of any reference to Tor in the related TTPs suggests that FIN4 does not rely on Tor for their C2 communications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is more likely that FIN4 uses DNS, multi-hop proxies, and symmetric cryptography for their C2 communications rather than Tor. Therefore, the answer is:

   **Final Answer: B: No**
