### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an adversary might use after achieving persistence.
   - The sequence in question is:
     1. Achieving persistence by modifying registry keys.
     2. Using process injection techniques for defense evasion.
     3. Gathering system details using registry queries.
     4. Using thread manipulation techniques for discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:**
     - This technique involves performing system checks to avoid detection or to determine the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - Modifying registry keys using functions like `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, and `SetBinaryValue` is a common method for achieving persistence. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Using process injection techniques such as `ZwWriteVirtualMemory` and `RtlNtStatusToDosError` is a common method for defense evasion. This aligns with the second part of the sequence.
   - **Gathering System Details:**
     - Querying the registry using functions like `GetStringValue` is a common method for gathering system details, which aligns with the third part of the sequence.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Using thread manipulation techniques like `ZwGetContextThread` for discovery activities is less common. However, it is possible that adversaries might use such techniques to gather more detailed information about the system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After achieving persistence, adversaries often use defense evasion techniques to avoid detection. Following this, they gather system details and perform discovery activities to understand the environment better.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of querying the registry for discovery and performing system checks for defense evasion.
