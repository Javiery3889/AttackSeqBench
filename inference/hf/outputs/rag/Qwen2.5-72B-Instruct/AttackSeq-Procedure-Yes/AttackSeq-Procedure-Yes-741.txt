### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Desert Falcons used spear phishing emails and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access after operating campaigns with homemade backdoors for Command and Control activities like keylogging and password stealing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
   - These TTPs are all related to the Initial Access phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and specifically to phishing and spear phishing techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the Desert Falcons used spear phishing and social engineering techniques for Initial Access.
     - The related TTPs strongly support this choice. Phishing and spear phishing are common methods for gaining initial access to a target's system. The techniques T1566, T1566.002, and T1566.001 are all relevant to this method.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the Desert Falcons used spear phishing and social engineering techniques for Initial Access.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs. Given the context of the question and the provided TTPs, it is less plausible that the Desert Falcons did not use these techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Desert Falcons used spear phishing and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
