### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Initial access using Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199.
     2. Execution of an embedded .hta file using mshta.exe.
     3. Achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CVE-2017-0199 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, often through an embedded .hta file.
   - **Execution of .hta file:**
     - The .hta file is typically executed using the `mshta.exe` utility, which is a common method for executing embedded scripts in Office documents.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes is a plausible method for achieving persistence. This task name is often used to blend in with legitimate system tasks, making it less likely to be detected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the attack followed the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
