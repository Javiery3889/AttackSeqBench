### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Aumlib malware downloading updated samples from specific URLs and sharing code with an older variant after evading detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications. Malware often uses these protocols to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands, download updates, or exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools:**
     - This technique involves altering or removing indicators from tools to evade detection. This can include encoding or obfuscating communication patterns to avoid signature-based detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Aumlib malware will download updated samples from specific URLs and share code with an older variant as part of the attackers' C2 activity.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** Aumlib malware can use web protocols to download updated samples from specific URLs. This is a common technique in C2 operations to ensure the malware remains up-to-date and can adapt to new environments or defenses.
       - **T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools:** Aumlib malware can alter HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques to evade detection. This aligns with the question's mention of altering communication patterns.
       - Sharing code with an older variant is also plausible as it can help maintain compatibility and leverage existing functionalities while adding new features or evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Aumlib malware will not download updated samples from specific URLs and share code with an older variant.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs. The use of web protocols for C2 and the alteration of communication patterns to evade detection strongly suggest that the malware would engage in activities such as downloading updates and sharing code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the plausibility of the described activities, the most likely answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
