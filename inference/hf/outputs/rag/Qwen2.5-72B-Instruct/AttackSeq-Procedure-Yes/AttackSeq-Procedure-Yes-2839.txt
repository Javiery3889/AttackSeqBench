### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - Evading defenses through a dropper.
     - Persisting in the system using the 'upnphost.exe' executable by setting a registry key.
     - Gathering system information.
     - Sending the gathered information to a server located in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves establishing a communication channel with a remote server to send and receive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will gather system information and send it to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1082-System Information Discovery** aligns with the gathering of system information.
       - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** aligns with sending the gathered information to a remote server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will not gather system information and send it to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that APT28 is likely to perform both system information discovery and bidirectional communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that APT28 will gather system information and send it to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
