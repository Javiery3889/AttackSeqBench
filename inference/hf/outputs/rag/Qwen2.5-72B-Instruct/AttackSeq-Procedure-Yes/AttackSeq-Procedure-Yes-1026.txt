### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection after inserting malicious macros and using a backdoor for discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which are often used to store sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory locations on a system, which can help in locating sensitive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after discovering interesting files (T1083), the malware would proceed to collect data from network shared drives (T1039). This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like Gamaredon, which often aim to gather as much sensitive data as possible.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not scan network shared drives for sensitive data. However, this contradicts the related TTPs, which indicate that data collection from network shared drives is a common technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of APTs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
