### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by a malware (netsat.exe) that infects removable media, collects data from infected drives, and then potentially uses netui3.dll and winmgt.dll to collect detailed system information before self-deleting based on a hardcoded date for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the first part of the question where netsat.exe infects and collects data from removable media.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to evade detection, which aligns with the part of the question where the malware self-deletes based on a hardcoded date.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that netui3.dll and winmgt.dll will collect detailed system information before the malware self-deletes.
     - The question does not explicitly mention the involvement of netui3.dll and winmgt.dll in collecting detailed system information. However, it is plausible that these DLLs could be used for such purposes, especially if they are part of the malware's functionality.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that netui3.dll and winmgt.dll will not collect detailed system information before the malware self-deletes.
     - The question does not provide direct evidence that these DLLs are involved in collecting detailed system information, but it also does not rule out this possibility.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the sequence of actions: infection of removable media, data collection, and self-deletion. The related TTPs confirm the collection of data from removable media and the file deletion for defense evasion.
   - While the involvement of netui3.dll and winmgt.dll in collecting detailed system information is not explicitly stated, it is a plausible step in a more sophisticated attack sequence. However, the question does not provide enough information to definitively confirm this step.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The question does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm that netui3.dll and winmgt.dll will collect detailed system information before the malware self-deletes. Therefore, the most plausible answer based on the given information is "No."
