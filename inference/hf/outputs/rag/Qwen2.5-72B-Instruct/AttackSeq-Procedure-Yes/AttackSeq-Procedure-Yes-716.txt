### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by fetching various system information (network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, and OS product name) from the registry.
   - It then asks whether the implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP) for command and control (C2) communications, which is relevant to the question about HTTP POST requests.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names to communicate with C2 servers, which is also relevant to the question about communicating with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1568 (Dynamic Resolution) strongly suggest that the Rising Sun implant is likely to use HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers. The initial reconnaissance (T1012) is a common precursor to establishing C2 communications, as the attacker needs to gather system information to tailor their commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice would be less plausible given the related TTPs. The techniques T1071.001 and T1568 indicate that HTTP POST requests are a common method for C2 communications, and the initial reconnaissance (T1012) is a typical step in the attack chain.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
