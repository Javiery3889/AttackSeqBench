### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Duke group, after using Seaduke to securely communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server, is likely to exfiltrate sensitive data to legitimate cloud services using Seaduke for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications from being intercepted.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group will exfiltrate sensitive data to legitimate cloud services using Seaduke for exfiltration.
     - Given that Seaduke is already being used for secure communication with the C2 server (T1573-Encrypted Channel), it is plausible that the same tool could be used for exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group will not exfiltrate sensitive data to legitimate cloud services using Seaduke for exfiltration.
     - This choice is less likely because it contradicts the use of Seaduke for both C2 and exfiltration, which is a common practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of APT groups, it is more plausible that the Duke group will use Seaduke for both secure communication and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
