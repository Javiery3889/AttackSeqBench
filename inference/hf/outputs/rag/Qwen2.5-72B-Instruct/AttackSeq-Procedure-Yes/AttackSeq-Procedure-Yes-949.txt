### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration becomes operational for communications.
   - The context involves the Collection phase, where data is scanned and staged for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
     - Commonly used ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) are often used for this purpose to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves having a backup or fallback method for C2 communications in case the primary method fails.
     - The fallback C&C server is embedded in the configuration to ensure continued communication if the primary server is unavailable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before the fallback C&C server is used.
     - This aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves using the same channel for both C2 and exfiltration, typically over commonly used ports.
     - It also aligns with the T1008 technique, which indicates that a fallback C&C server is used if the primary server fails.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that data will not be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before the fallback C&C server is used.
     - This does not align well with the T1041 technique, which typically involves using the primary C&C channel for exfiltration.
     - It also does not align with the T1008 technique, which suggests that the fallback C&C server is a secondary option.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before the fallback C&C server is used.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
