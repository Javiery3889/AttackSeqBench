### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where WinDealer malware is delivered via a legitimate application's automatic update mechanism and maintains persistence through the registry's RUN key.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that WinDealer will use UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 for Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using ports that are not commonly associated with standard services to avoid detection.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the application layer to communicate, often to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** The use of UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 aligns with the T1571 technique, as these are non-standard ports. Standard ports for common services (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443) are well-known and monitored, so using non-standard ports can help evade detection.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique is less directly relevant to the specific ports mentioned but suggests that the malware might use protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication. However, the question does not specify the protocol, only the ports.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the use of non-standard ports (6999 and 55556) aligns with the T1571 technique, it is plausible that WinDealer would use these ports for C2 communication to avoid detection.
   - The T1095 technique, while relevant to evasion, does not contradict the use of non-standard ports.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
