### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions taken by the Dridex loader after it is downloaded via malicious documents with embedded macros.
   - Specifically, it asks if the loader is likely to use the `OutputDebugStringW` function for anti-debugging before employing RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the process of converting obfuscated or encoded data into its original form.
   - **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the use of various methods to obfuscate or encode data to make it harder to detect or analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique is relevant to the process of deobfuscating or decoding data, which is the reverse of obfuscation. It is not directly related to anti-debugging techniques.
   - **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique is directly related to the use of obfuscation methods, such as RC4 encryption, to evade detection.

   - The question specifically mentions the use of `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging. Anti-debugging techniques are used to detect and prevent the analysis of malware by security researchers. The `OutputDebugStringW` function is often used in anti-debugging to check if a debugger is attached to the process.

   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Downloading the Dridex loader via malicious documents with embedded macros.
     2. Using `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging.
     3. Employing RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings.

   - Based on the related TTPs, the use of RC4 encryption (T1027) is a common technique for obfuscation and evasion. However, the use of `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - While the use of RC4 encryption (T1027) is a common and plausible step in the Dridex loader's behavior, the specific use of `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the Dridex loader will use `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging before employing RC4 encryption.

**Final Answer: B: No**
