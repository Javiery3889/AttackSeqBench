### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Gamaredon's malware:
     - Searching for sensitive documents.
     - Capturing screenshots every minute.
     - Using HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control (C&C) communication.
     - Transferring harvested documents to the C&C server for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique indicates that the malware uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique indicates that the malware automatically exfiltrates data to a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C&C communication before transferring harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs:
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** confirms the use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
       - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** confirms the automated transfer of data to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C&C communication before transferring harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as T1071.001-Web Protocols specifically mentions the use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C&C communication before transferring harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
