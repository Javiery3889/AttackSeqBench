### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities by the Machete malware:
     - It uses FTP and HTTP to communicate with C&C servers.
     - It can download additional files for execution.
     - The question asks if it is likely to automatically copy data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present during the exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives, external hard drives, etc.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a compromised system to an external location.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique suggests that the malware might look for and collect data from removable media. However, it does not specify that the malware automatically copies data from all drives to a removable drive.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data, but it does not specify the method of exfiltration (e.g., to a removable drive).

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the malware automatically copies data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present. However, the related TTPs do not provide strong evidence to support this specific behavior.
   - **B: No**
     - This would imply that the malware does not automatically copy data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present. The related TTPs suggest that the malware might collect data from removable media and exfiltrate data, but they do not specify the automatic copying of data from all drives to a removable drive.

### Final Answer:
Based on the related TTPs and the lack of specific evidence supporting the automatic copying of data from all drives to a removable drive, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
