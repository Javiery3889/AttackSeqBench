### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access scenario where a malicious macro in a Word document is used to inject the Sharpshooter downloader into memory.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Word document with a macro.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VB) scripts for execution, which is often used in macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through a malicious macro in a Word document, which aligns with T1204.002 (Malicious File).
   - **Injection of Sharpshooter Downloader:**
     - The Sharpshooter downloader is injected into memory, which is a common technique for evading detection and maintaining persistence.
   - **Rising Sun Implant:**
     - The Rising Sun implant is known to be a sophisticated piece of malware that often includes the capability to download additional payloads.
   - **Second-Stage Payload:**
     - It is common for initial downloaders and implants to download additional payloads to perform further malicious activities. This is a standard practice in multi-stage attacks to maintain stealth and flexibility.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the nature of the Rising Sun implant and the common practice of multi-stage attacks, it is highly likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
