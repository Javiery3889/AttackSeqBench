### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Elise malware:
     - Injecting the `NavShExt.dll` into the Internet Explorer process.
     - Creating a mutex named `donotbotherme` to prevent duplicate executions.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware will employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting a dynamic-link library (DLL) into a process to execute code in the context of that process. This is a common method for evading detection and maintaining persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This is a broader category that includes various methods of injecting code into processes, including DLL injection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Injection and Mutex Creation:**
     - The injection of `NavShExt.dll` into the Internet Explorer process and the creation of a mutex are both techniques used to evade detection and ensure the malware runs only once.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - The question asks about additional defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation.
     - These techniques are commonly used by sophisticated malware to avoid detection by security tools and analysts.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrating data to a C2 server is a critical step in many malware operations, and it often involves additional defense evasion to avoid detection during this phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the malware has already employed techniques to evade detection (DLL injection and mutex creation), it is highly likely that it will continue to use additional defense evasion techniques such as anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation to protect its C2 communication and data exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
