### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla, after establishing persistence via Windows scheduled tasks and installing second-stage malware like PyFlash or NetFlash, is likely to use the PyFlash backdoor to execute commands for system information gathering and then send the gathered information to its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system, often involving initial and secondary backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence via Windows Scheduled Tasks:**
     - This is a common method for maintaining long-term access to a system.
   - **Installing Second-Stage Malware (PyFlash or NetFlash):**
     - PyFlash and NetFlash are known to be used by Turla for maintaining control and executing commands on the compromised system.
   - **Using PyFlash to Execute Commands:**
     - The commands mentioned (systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, getmac, and arp) are typical for gathering system and network information, which aligns with the T1016 technique.
   - **Sending Gathered Information to C&C Server:**
     - This is a common step in the command and control process, aligning with the T1104 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs, it is highly likely that Turla will use the PyFlash backdoor to execute the specified commands and send the gathered information to its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
