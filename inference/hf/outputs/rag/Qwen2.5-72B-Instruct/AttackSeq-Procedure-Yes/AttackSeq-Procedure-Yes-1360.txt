### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an initial exploit (CVE-2015-5119) is used to execute a first stage downloader. This downloader retrieves a second stage payload (PlugX) and establishes communication with C2 domains starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will communicate with other domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` as part of its command and control protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring additional tools or payloads to the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This suggests that the attack involves multiple stages of communication, which aligns with the described sequence of events (initial exploit, first stage downloader, second stage payload).
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This suggests that DNS requests are used to communicate with C2 servers, which is consistent with the use of domains like `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This suggests that additional tools or payloads are transferred, which is consistent with the retrieval of the second stage PlugX file.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - If Sakula malware is part of the same attack chain, it is possible that it could communicate with additional C2 domains. However, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of communication with `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - Given the specific domains mentioned (`inocnation[.]com` and `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`), there is no direct evidence in the related TTPs that suggests these domains are part of the same C2 infrastructure. The related TTPs focus on the initial stages and the use of DNS for communication, but do not provide specific information about these domains.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that it is unlikely that the Sakula malware will communicate with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` as part of its command and control protocol, given the specific context and related TTPs provided.

Final Answer: B: No
