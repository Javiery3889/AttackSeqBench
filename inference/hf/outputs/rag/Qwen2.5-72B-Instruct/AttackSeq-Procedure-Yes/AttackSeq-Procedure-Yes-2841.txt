### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - This exploit is used to drop an embedded downloader file.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute, download a full RAT component from a specific IP and port, and establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a document reader) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1059.007-JavaScript:** This sub-technique involves using JavaScript to execute code on the victim's machine.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring additional tools or components to the victim's machine after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1203):** The weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 aligns with T1203, as it is a client-side exploit.
   - **Execution (T1059.007):** The embedded downloader file, likely written in JavaScript, aligns with T1059.007, as it is used to execute the MSIL/Crimson malware.
   - **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105):** The MSIL/Crimson malware downloading the full RAT component from the specified IP and port aligns with T1105, as it involves transferring additional tools to the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control (Custom TCP Protocol):** The question mentions establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol, which is a common next step after the RAT component is downloaded and executed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described attack sequence with the related TTPs, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute, download the full RAT component, and establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
