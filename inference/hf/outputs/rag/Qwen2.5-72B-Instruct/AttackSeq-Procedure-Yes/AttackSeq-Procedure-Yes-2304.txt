### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will move laterally to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM after performing specific actions: using PsLogList for account discovery with exported Windows Security Event Logs and executing Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz to dump credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management (WinRM):** This technique involves using WinRM to execute commands on remote systems, which is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is a common method for credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Account Discovery with PsLogList:**
     - PsLogList is a tool used to export Windows Security Event Logs, which can be analyzed to discover user accounts and their activities. This is a common initial step in gathering information about the network.
   - **Executing Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz:**
     - Mimikatz is a powerful tool used to dump credentials from the LSASS memory. This is a critical step in gaining access to valid credentials, which are necessary for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM:**
     - Once the adversary has valid credentials, they can use various methods to move laterally, including SMB, PsExec, and WinRM. WinRM, in particular, is mentioned in the related TTPs and is a common method for executing commands on remote systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. After discovering accounts and dumping credentials, the adversary would have the necessary information and credentials to move laterally to a domain controller using methods like SMB, PsExec, or WinRM.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, as they include both the credential access technique (T1003.001) and the lateral movement technique (T1021.006).
