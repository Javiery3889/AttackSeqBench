### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT-TOCS, after using defense evasion techniques like running in memory and multi-beacon communication, is likely to use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicate with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the command and control stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system. This can include using different protocols and methods to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute malicious payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - Running in memory and multi-beacon communication are common techniques used to evade detection by security systems. Running in memory allows the malware to avoid leaving traces on the disk, and multi-beacon communication helps to avoid pattern recognition by security systems.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - The use of HTTP GET requests for C2 communication is a common technique. It is often used because HTTP traffic is less likely to be blocked by firewalls and is easier to blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **PowerShell for Script Execution:**
     - PowerShell is a versatile tool that can be used to download and execute scripts. It is often used in the execution stage to download and run additional payloads, including encrypted data scripts.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that APT-TOCS would use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicate with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the command and control stage. This aligns with the use of multi-stage channels and the execution of scripts using PowerShell.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
