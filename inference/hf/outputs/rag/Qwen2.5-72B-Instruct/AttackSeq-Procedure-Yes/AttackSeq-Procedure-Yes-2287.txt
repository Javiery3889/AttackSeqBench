### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs for the DNSpionage malware.
   - Specifically, it asks if the malware will execute a PE file before maintaining persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique describes the initial access method where the attacker uses spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents as attachments.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique describes how the attacker maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The malware gains initial access through spear-phishing with a malicious Microsoft Office document. This is a common initial access vector.
   - **Execution of PE File:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for malware to execute a PE (Portable Executable) file to perform its malicious activities. This step is often necessary to establish a foothold in the system.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Once the malware has executed and established a foothold, it will typically attempt to maintain persistence. One common method is by creating a scheduled task, as described in T1053.005.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Initial access through spear-phishing with a malicious Microsoft Office document.
     2. Execution of a PE file.
     3. Creation of a scheduled task for persistence.
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with common malware behavior.
