### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution, following reconnaissance activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering remote systems on the network, which is a common step after gaining initial access to understand the network topology.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering active network connections on the system, which helps in understanding the network environment and identifying potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:** The question mentions that reconnaissance activities such as gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods have been performed. This aligns with the initial stages of an attack where the adversary gathers information about the target.
   - **Employee-Enabled Macro Execution:** This is a common method for initial infection, where a malicious macro in a document is executed by an unsuspecting employee, leading to the installation of malware like BlackEnergy 3.
   - **Establishing C2 Communication:** After the malware is installed, it is highly likely that it will attempt to establish communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events described (reconnaissance, macro execution, and the nature of BlackEnergy 3), it is highly likely that the malware will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
