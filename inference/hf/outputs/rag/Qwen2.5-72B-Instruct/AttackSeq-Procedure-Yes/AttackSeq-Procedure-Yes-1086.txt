### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Lazarus Group gains initial access through malicious documents containing job offers sent via various communication platforms (LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email).
   - It then asks if it is likely that the group will use system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` to gather victim host information during reconnaissance before executing malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and leveraging the SQLite DLL library.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using system utilities to gather information about the network configuration of the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using spearphishing via services like LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email to gain initial access to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that the initial access is gained through malicious documents containing job offers sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email. This aligns with the T1566.003 technique.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, the question states that the group will use system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` to gather victim host information. This aligns with the T1016 technique, which involves system network configuration discovery.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:**
     - The question also mentions the use of the CommsCacher backdoor and leveraging the SQLite DLL library. This is a plausible next step after reconnaissance, as the group would use the gathered information to execute more targeted and sophisticated attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the alignment of the described attack sequence with the related TTPs, it is likely that the Lazarus Group will use system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` to gather victim host information during reconnaissance before executing malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and leveraging the SQLite DLL library.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
