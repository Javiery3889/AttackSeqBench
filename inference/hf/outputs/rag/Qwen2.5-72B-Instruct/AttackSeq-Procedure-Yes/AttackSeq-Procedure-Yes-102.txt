### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Waterbear malware, after decrypting its payload and injecting it into an existing Windows Service, is likely to use API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying memory-resident functions such as 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to execute code. This is relevant because the malware is injecting its payload into an existing Windows Service, which likely involves using native APIs.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This technique involves hooking into APIs to capture credentials. While this is related to credential access, it does not directly address the evasion technique mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or modifying indicators to evade detection. This is relevant because the question asks about evading detection by modifying memory-resident functions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The question mentions API hooking to evade detection by modifying memory-resident functions. The T1562.006-Indicator Blocking technique is directly related to evading detection, which aligns with the idea of modifying memory-resident functions to avoid being detected.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the malware does not use API hooking to evade detection. However, the related TTPs, particularly T1562.006-Indicator Blocking, suggest that the malware does indeed use techniques to evade detection, which could include API hooking.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the Waterbear malware is likely to use API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying memory-resident functions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
