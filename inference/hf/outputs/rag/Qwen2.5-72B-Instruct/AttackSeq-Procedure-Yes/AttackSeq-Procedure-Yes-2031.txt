### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution of a Visual Basic macro to reassemble and execute a portable executable.
     - Achieving persistence by registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the startup shell.
     - Evading defenses through anti-debugging techniques such as CryptDecrypt() and IsDebuggerPresent API.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves adding a registry run key or placing a file in the startup folder to ensure the malware runs at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process using Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution of a Visual Basic macro:**
     - This aligns with T1059.005, which is about using Visual Basic scripts to execute code.
   - **Achieving persistence by registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the startup shell:**
     - This aligns with T1547.001, which involves adding a registry run key or placing a file in the startup folder.
   - **Evading defenses through anti-debugging techniques:**
     - The question mentions specific API calls like CryptDecrypt() and IsDebuggerPresent, which are common anti-debugging techniques. However, these are not directly listed in the provided TTPs. The closest related TTP is T1546.012, which involves code injection, but it is more about persistence rather than anti-debugging.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible based on the provided TTPs. The execution of a Visual Basic macro and achieving persistence through registry run keys are well-supported by the TTPs.
   - The anti-debugging techniques mentioned (CryptDecrypt() and IsDebuggerPresent) are not directly listed in the TTPs, but they are common in malware to evade detection and analysis.
