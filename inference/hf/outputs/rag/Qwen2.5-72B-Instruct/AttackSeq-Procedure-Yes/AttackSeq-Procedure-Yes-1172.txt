### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a group will deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services before using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.
   - The key points are:
     - Conducting vulnerability scanning.
     - Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
     - Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in external systems to identify potential entry points.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to access remote services and gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Vulnerability Scanning (T1595.002):**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, where the group identifies vulnerabilities in external systems.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):**
     - After identifying vulnerabilities, the group is likely to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the system.
   - **External Remote Services (T1133):**
     - Once initial access is gained, the group may then use stolen credentials to maintain persistent access and move laterally within the network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical attack pattern:
     1. **Reconnaissance (Vulnerability Scanning):** The group scans for vulnerabilities.
     2. **Initial Access (Exploit Public-Facing Application):** The group exploits the identified vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
     3. **Initial Access (External Remote Services):** The group uses stolen credentials to maintain persistent access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
