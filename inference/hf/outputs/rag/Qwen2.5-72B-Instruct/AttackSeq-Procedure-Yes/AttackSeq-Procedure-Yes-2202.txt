### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor Earth Lusca will target user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz before exploiting remote services for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is often done using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Scanning for Machines:** The initial step involves scanning the network to identify potential targets. Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan are used for this purpose.
     - **Credential Access:** After identifying potential targets, the next logical step is to gain access to user credentials. This is often done using tools like procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials from the LSASS memory.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Once the credentials are obtained, the threat actor can use them to exploit remote services and move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is logical that Earth Lusca would target user credentials before exploiting remote services for lateral movement. The credential access step (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) is a prerequisite for the lateral movement step (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services).

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
