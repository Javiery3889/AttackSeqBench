### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 is likely to use a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network after gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, before deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique involves stealing private keys, which can be used to authenticate and gain access to systems.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for future use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1078.002-Domain Accounts):** APT15 has already gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, which is a powerful tool for extracting credentials from memory. This indicates that they have already achieved initial access to the network.
   - **Credential Access (T1552.004-Private Keys):** While this technique involves stealing private keys, the question specifically mentions a stolen VPN certificate, which is a different type of credential. However, both are related to credential access.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials):** This technique involves collecting credentials for future use, which aligns with the idea of using the stolen credentials to gain further access.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes:** This suggests that APT15 will use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors.
   - **Answer B: No:** This suggests that APT15 will not use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors.

### Reasoning:
- APT15 has already gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, which provides them with significant access to the network.
- Using a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network is a plausible next step, especially if the APT group wants to maintain persistent access or access the network from a remote location.
- Deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS is a common tactic for maintaining long-term access and control over the network.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
