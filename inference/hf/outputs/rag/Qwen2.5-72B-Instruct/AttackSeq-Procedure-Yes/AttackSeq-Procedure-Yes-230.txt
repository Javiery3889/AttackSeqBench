### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group, after using a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory for defense evasion, is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain a connection with a C2 server. This is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors to ensure resilience and stealth.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the legitimate Windows utility `rundll32.exe` to load and execute malicious code, often to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding data to make it usable, often used to hide the true nature of the payload until it is executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory is a sophisticated method of defense evasion. Once the backdoor is executed, it is highly likely that the next step would be to establish a connection with a C2 server to receive further commands and conduct activities. This aligns with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique, which is a common practice for maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice suggests that the backdoor would not connect to a C2 server. However, this is less likely given the context of the Lazarus group's known tactics. The group is known for using C2 servers to maintain control over compromised systems and to receive commands for further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of the Lazarus group, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor would connect to a C2 server after being executed in memory.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
