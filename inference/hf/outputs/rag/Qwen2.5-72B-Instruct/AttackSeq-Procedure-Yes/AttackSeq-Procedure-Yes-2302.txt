### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an adversary uses PsLogList for account discovery and Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials of privileged users during the Discovery phase.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the adversary will attempt to clean up traces of their intrusions through activities such as Windows event logs clearing, file deletion, and timestomping during the Defense Evasion phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs:** This sub-technique specifically involves clearing Windows event logs to remove traces of the adversary's actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary is likely to clean up traces of their intrusions.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that after performing account discovery and credential dumping, the adversary would want to cover their tracks to avoid detection.
     - Clearing Windows event logs (T1070.001) is a common technique used in the Defense Evasion phase to remove evidence of their activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary is unlikely to clean up traces of their intrusions.
     - This is less plausible because it is a common and expected behavior for adversaries to attempt to hide their actions to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of adversaries, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary will attempt to clean up traces of their intrusions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
