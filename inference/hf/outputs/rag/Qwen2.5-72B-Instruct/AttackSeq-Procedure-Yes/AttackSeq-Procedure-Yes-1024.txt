### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gamaredonâ€™s malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase after injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:**
     - This technique involves modifying shared content (e.g., documents) to include malicious code, which can then be used to spread to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves searching for and collecting data from the local system, which can include sensitive documents.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - The attack starts with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments, which is a common initial access method for many threat actors, including Gamaredon.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1080-Taint Shared Content):**
     - After gaining initial access, the malware injects malicious macros into accessible Word and Excel documents. This is a form of lateral movement, as it spreads the infection to other systems that access these documents.
   - **Collection (T1005-Data from Local System):**
     - Once the malware has spread to other systems, it is logical for the malware to search for and collect sensitive documents from the local system. This is a common next step in the attack lifecycle to gather valuable information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs, it is highly likely that after lateral movement via compromised systems, the malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase. This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like Gamaredon.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
