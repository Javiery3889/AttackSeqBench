### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SkinnyBoy, before communicating with the C2 server, has collected data by base64 encoding the output of system-related commands and directory content using the `CryptBinaryToStringA` API.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data (e.g., base64) to obfuscate the content of the data being exfiltrated or communicated to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique is relevant to the communication method (HTTP POST request) mentioned in the question.
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique is relevant to the encoding method (base64) mentioned in the question.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of the `CryptBinaryToStringA` API, which is a common method for base64 encoding in Windows environments.
   - It is common for malware to encode data before sending it to a C2 server to avoid detection and to ensure the data is transmitted in a format that can be easily processed by the server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common practice of encoding data before C2 communication, it is likely that SkinnyBoy would have collected and base64 encoded the output of system-related commands and directory content before sending it to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
