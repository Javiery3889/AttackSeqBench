### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC after achieving credential access through the Responder tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) to capture and relay credentials.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to execute commands on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (T1557.001):** The Responder tool is used to capture and relay credentials, which aligns with the LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay technique.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1021.002):** After obtaining credentials, the next logical step is to use these credentials to move laterally within the network. SMB/Windows Admin Shares is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **Execution (T1047):** WMIC can be used to execute commands on remote systems, which is a common technique for lateral movement and can be used after obtaining credentials.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Step 1: Credential Access:** The Lazarus group uses the Responder tool to capture and relay credentials.
   - **Step 2: Lateral Movement:** Using the captured credentials, the group can then use SMB/Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within the network.
   - **Step 3: Execution:** WMIC can be used to execute commands on the compromised systems to further the attack.
   - **Step 4: Discovery:** After gaining access to additional systems, the group may conduct discovery activities such as network share discovery to gather more information and identify additional targets.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (credential access followed by lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC before conducting discovery activities) is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs based on the related TTPs provided.
