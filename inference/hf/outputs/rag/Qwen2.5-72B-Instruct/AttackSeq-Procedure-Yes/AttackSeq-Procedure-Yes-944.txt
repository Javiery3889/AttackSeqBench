### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will scan for files matching specific extensions after gathering information about the victim's computer and environment through commands for registry key enumeration and listing running processes.
   - The key activities mentioned are:
     - Registry key enumeration
     - Listing running processes
     - Scanning for files matching specific extensions
     - Preparing staged data for exfiltration

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, registry keys, and other system information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, which can include scanning for specific file types.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on the system, which is a common step before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Key Enumeration and Listing Running Processes:**
     - These activities are part of the discovery phase, where the malware gathers information about the system to understand its environment.
   - **Scanning for Files Matching Specific Extensions:**
     - This activity is part of the collection phase, where the malware identifies specific files of interest.
   - **Preparing Staged Data for Exfiltration:**
     - This activity is part of the exfiltration phase, where the malware prepares the identified files for transfer.

   Given the related TTPs:
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** aligns with the scanning for files matching specific extensions.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** and **T1119-Automated Collection** align with the collection and preparation of data for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of activities and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will scan for files matching specific extensions after gathering information about the victim's computer and environment.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
