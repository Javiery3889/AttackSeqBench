### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has been executed by rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of the malware, making it harder for security tools to detect and analyze.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware discovering files and directories on the system, which is a common step in the attack lifecycle but not directly related to evasion or obfuscation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed use evasion techniques and obfuscation.
     - Given the related TTP T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information), it is highly likely that the malware will use obfuscation to avoid detection. The use of a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension in the %Temp% folder is a common obfuscation technique to blend in with legitimate system files and avoid suspicion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use evasion techniques and obfuscation.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP T1027, which specifically mentions obfuscation as a technique used in defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
