### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the callCam app, after the SideWinder APT group has evaded detection using obfuscation and data encryption, is likely to collect information about the device's location as part of its discovery operations before encrypting the collected data for exfiltration to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less recognizable to defenders.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation** and **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** are both related to evading detection, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the SideWinder APT group uses obfuscation and data encryption methods.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method** is related to the exfiltration of data, which is mentioned in the question as the final step of encrypting and exfiltrating the collected data to the C&C server.
   - The question specifically asks about the collection of device location information as part of the discovery operations. The related TTPs do not explicitly mention the collection of location data, but they do cover the broader context of data collection and exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention the collection of location data, it is a common practice for APT groups to gather as much information as possible about the compromised device, including location data, to better understand the environment and tailor their attacks.
   - The sequence described in the question (evade detection, collect information, encrypt, and exfiltrate) is a logical and common attack flow for APT groups.
