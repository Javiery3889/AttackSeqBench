### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Emissary Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.
     - Installing webshells on SharePoint servers.
     - Uploading tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, to perform execution.
     - Scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that Emissary Panda exploited CVE-2019-0604, which is a public-facing application vulnerability (Microsoft SharePoint). This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Webshell Installation:**
     - Installing webshells is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access through a vulnerability. Webshells allow the attacker to maintain persistence and execute commands on the server.
   - **Uploading Tools and Backdoors:**
     - Uploading tools and custom backdoors like HyperBro is a logical next step to establish a foothold and perform further actions within the network.
   - **Network Scanning:**
     - Scanning the network for other vulnerable systems is a common tactic to expand the attack. Using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144 (a known vulnerability in SMB) is a plausible action to find and exploit other vulnerable systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the alignment with the T1190 technique, the most plausible answer is that Emissary Panda did indeed follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
