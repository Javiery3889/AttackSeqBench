### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Derusbi, after using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection, is likely to gather system information before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves the use of protocols below the application layer (e.g., raw sockets) to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Derusbi will gather system information before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Gathering system information (T1082) is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack. It helps the adversary understand the environment and plan subsequent actions.
       - After evading detection using the Turbo Linux LKM, it is logical for the adversary to gather system information to ensure they have a clear understanding of the victim host before proceeding with more advanced actions like binding to a raw socket and communicating with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Derusbi will not gather system information before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While it is possible for an adversary to skip the discovery phase, it is less likely given the context of the question. The use of the Turbo Linux LKM indicates a sophisticated attack, and sophisticated adversaries typically gather system information to ensure their actions are effective and stealthy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a sophisticated attack, the most plausible sequence is that Derusbi will gather system information before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
