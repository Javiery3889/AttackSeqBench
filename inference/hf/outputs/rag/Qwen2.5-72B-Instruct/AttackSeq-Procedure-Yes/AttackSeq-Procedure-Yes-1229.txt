### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether POWERSHOWER, after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server, is likely to communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop to maintain Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting system information to understand the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** This is the initial step where POWERSHOWER collects system information. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1071.004-DNS):** These techniques are used to maintain communication with the C2 server. After collecting and sending system information, it is logical for the malware to continue communicating with the C2 server to receive further commands or instructions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the related TTPs include both system information discovery and command and control techniques, it is highly likely that POWERSHOWER will continue to communicate with the C2 server after the initial information gathering. This is a common behavior in malware to maintain persistent control over the infected machine.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
