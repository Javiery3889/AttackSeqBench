### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers developed malware capabilities as part of their Resource Development efforts before achieving Initial Access through a compromised software update.
   - The context is the SolarWinds attack, where the attackers demonstrated advanced reconnaissance capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.004-Exploits:** This technique involves the development or acquisition of exploits to use in an attack.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves the development or acquisition of malware to use in an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Capabilities:** The attackers demonstrated advanced reconnaissance capabilities by understanding the SolarWinds source code and internal development domain names. This indicates a high level of sophistication and preparation.
   - **Resource Development:** The related TTPs suggest that the attackers likely engaged in resource development activities, including the development or acquisition of both exploits and malware.
   - **Initial Access through Compromised Software Update:** The SolarWinds attack involved the use of a compromised software update to gain initial access. This suggests that the attackers had already developed the necessary malware to embed in the update.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the advanced reconnaissance capabilities, it is highly likely that the attackers would have developed or acquired the necessary malware as part of their resource development efforts.
   - The use of a compromised software update to achieve initial access implies that the attackers had the malware ready before the attack was executed.
   - The related TTPs (T1587.001-Malware and T1587.004-Exploits) further support the idea that the attackers were engaged in resource development activities, including malware development.

### Final Answer:
