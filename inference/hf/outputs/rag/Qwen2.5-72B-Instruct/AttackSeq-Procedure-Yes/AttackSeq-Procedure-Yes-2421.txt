### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already compromised the bank's Enterprise Admin account through privilege escalation.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers would compromise the third-party processor's network, use captured credentials to connect to the processor's network, and conduct reconnaissance of the card processing service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain higher levels of access within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** Since the attackers have already compromised the bank's Enterprise Admin account, they have high-level access within the bank's network. This technique is relevant to the initial compromise and privilege escalation.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique is relevant to maintaining access and potentially moving laterally to other networks, such as the third-party processor's network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** The attackers have already gained high-level access within the bank's network by compromising the Enterprise Admin account.
   - **Step 2:** To compromise the third-party processor's network, the attackers would likely use the valid credentials they have obtained (T1078-Valid Accounts) to connect to the processor's network.
   - **Step 3:** Once connected to the processor's network, the attackers would conduct reconnaissance to understand the card processing service (T1046-Network Service Scanning, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, etc.).
   - **Step 4:** The use of external remote services (T1133) would be a logical step to maintain access and facilitate the reconnaissance and further actions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of the attack, it is likely that the attackers would compromise the third-party processor's network, use captured credentials to connect, and then conduct reconnaissance.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
