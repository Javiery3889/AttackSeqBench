### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Explosive Trojan.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Credential Access**: Using keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
     - **Lateral Movement**: Using writable mass storage devices (USBs) infected through a configurable USB infection option.
     - **Command and Control**: Employing a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware across a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using a multi-tiered server backend framework to maintain control over compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access**: The question mentions using keylogging to gain administrator passwords. This is a common technique for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement**: The question suggests using writable mass storage devices (USBs) for lateral movement. The related TTP T1091 (Replication Through Removable Media) supports this.
   - **Command and Control**: The question mentions using a multi-tiered server backend framework. The related TTP T1104 (Multi-Stage Channels) supports this.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     - **Credential Access**: Keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
     - **Lateral Movement**: Using infected USBs to spread the malware.
     - **Command and Control**: Using a multi-tiered server backend framework to maintain control.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the sequence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
