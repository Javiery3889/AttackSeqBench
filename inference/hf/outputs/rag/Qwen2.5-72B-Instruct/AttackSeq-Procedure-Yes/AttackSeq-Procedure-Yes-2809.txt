### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker gains SSH access to a target system, uses `wget` to fetch malware samples, and then potentially uses the Turbo Linux Kernel Module and Derusbi malware to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attacker's presence or actions.
   - **T1014-Rootkit:** This technique involves using rootkits to hide the presence of malware or other malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique aligns with the idea of deleting the Turbo Linux Kernel Module after it has been used to avoid detection.
   - **T1014-Rootkit:** This technique aligns with the idea of using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to load a rootkit into the kernel, which can help in hiding the presence of the Derusbi malware.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module will be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and then deleted by the Derusbi malware to avoid detection.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is unlikely.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module would be used to load a rootkit (T1014) and then deleted (T1070.004) to avoid detection. This aligns with common defense evasion techniques used by sophisticated malware like Derusbi.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
