### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data, Infamous Chisel will enumerate data directories to discover files of interest, collect GPS information, and then exfiltrate these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from various sources and staging it in a central location before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory information to identify files of interest.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique aligns with the part of the question where files are collected from application and data directories and staged for exfiltration.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique aligns with the part of the question where the adversary enumerates data directories to discover files of interest.

   - The question also mentions collecting GPS information, which is not directly covered by the provided TTPs. However, it is a plausible step in a comprehensive data collection process, especially if the adversary is interested in location data.

   - The exfiltration using Tor hidden service and SSH connections is a logical next step after data collection and staging, as it ensures the data is securely and anonymously transferred.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the provided TTPs with the described sequence of actions and the logical progression of the attack, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
