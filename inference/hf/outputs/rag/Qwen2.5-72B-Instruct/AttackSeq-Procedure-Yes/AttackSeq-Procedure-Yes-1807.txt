### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious file 'intel.wll' is dropped into the Word startup folder to establish persistence.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) module downloaded during the final stage of the infection chain will have capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, and execute new processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a program to the Windows Registry or startup folder to ensure it runs at system startup or when a user logs in.
   - **T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using Microsoft Office add-ins to maintain persistence and execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Startup Folder (T1547.001):** The file 'intel.wll' is dropped into the Word startup folder, which is a common method to ensure that the malicious code runs every time Microsoft Word is launched.
   - **Persistence via Add-ins (T1137.006):** This technique can be used to load the malicious code as an add-in, which can provide additional persistence and execution capabilities.
   - **RAT Capabilities:** RATs are typically designed to provide a wide range of functionalities to the attacker, including taking screenshots, listing files and directories, and executing new processes. These capabilities are essential for remote control and data exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question describes a RAT module being downloaded in the final stage of the infection chain, it is highly likely that this module will have the capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, and execute new processes. These are common and essential features of RATs to enable remote control and data exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
