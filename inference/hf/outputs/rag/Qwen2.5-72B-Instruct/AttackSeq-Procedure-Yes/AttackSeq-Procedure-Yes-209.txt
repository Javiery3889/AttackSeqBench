### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor after setting up encrypted communications with the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different, asymmetrically encrypted protocol that is not the same as the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.
     - Given that SparrowDoor is already being used for C&C communications and is capable of encrypted communications, it is plausible that the same tool and channel would be used for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow will not exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.
     - This would imply that FamousSparrow would use a different method or channel for exfiltration, which is less likely given the context of the question and the related TTPs.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) directly supports the idea that data exfiltration can occur over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - The use of SparrowDoor for both C&C and exfiltration is a common and efficient approach for adversaries, as it minimizes the number of different channels and tools they need to manage.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
