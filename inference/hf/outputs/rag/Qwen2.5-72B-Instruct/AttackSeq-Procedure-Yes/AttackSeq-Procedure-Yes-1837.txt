### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the callCam app is likely to encrypt the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase, and then send it to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It is common for attackers to use custom encoding or encryption to obfuscate the data being exfiltrated.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves archiving data using a custom method before exfiltration. This can include compressing or encrypting the data to make it smaller and more difficult to detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question mentions encrypting the data using RSA and AES during the Collection phase. While encryption is a common practice to protect data, it is more typical for encryption to occur during the Exfiltration phase rather than the Collection phase. The Collection phase is generally focused on gathering and preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The related TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that data is often encrypted or encoded during the Exfiltration phase to avoid detection. This aligns with the question's mention of using a customized encoding routine.
     - The related TTP T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method also supports the idea of data being processed (e.g., encrypted or compressed) before exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While encryption can occur during the Collection phase, it is more common and practical for encryption to occur during the Exfiltration phase to protect the data as it is being sent to the C&C server. The related TTPs support this sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
