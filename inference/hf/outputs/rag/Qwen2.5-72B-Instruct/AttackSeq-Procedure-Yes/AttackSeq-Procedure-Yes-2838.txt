### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware first discovers system information using the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` and sends this information to an IP address `45.124.132.127`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server before contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which aligns with the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Discovery and Exfiltration:**
     - The malware has already discovered system information and exfiltrated it to the IP address `45.124.132.127`. This aligns with the T1082 technique.
   - **Establishing HTTPS Communication:**
     - The question asks if the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.
     - Given the T1071.001 technique, it is common for malware to use HTTPS for C2 communication to avoid detection.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Typically, after initial discovery and exfiltration, malware will establish a more secure and persistent communication channel with the C2 server.
     - It is plausible that the malware would establish an HTTPS connection to the C2 server before moving on to contact `marina-info.net` for further operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
