### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a backdoor (likely associated with the Waterbear malware) uses API hooking techniques to evade detection. Specifically, it modifies the functions `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` in memory.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor's configuration will include an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address for communication with external entities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or data, making it harder for defenders to detect or analyze the malicious content.
   - **T1562.006 - Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves preventing or blocking the generation or transmission of indicators of compromise (IOCs) to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **API Hooking (ZwOpenProcess and GetExtendedTcpTable):** These functions are often used to manipulate process and network information, which can help the malware evade detection by hiding its presence or activities.
   - **Encrypted/Encoded File (T1027.013):** This technique is commonly used to protect the C&C server address and other sensitive information from being easily discovered. XOR encryption is a simple yet effective method for this purpose.
   - **Indicator Blocking (T1562.006):** This technique is used to prevent the detection of the malware by blocking or altering indicators that could be used to identify it.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware is already using API hooking to evade detection, it is highly likely that it will also use encryption to protect its C&C server address and other sensitive information. This is a common practice in advanced malware to ensure that the communication with the C&C server remains hidden and secure.
   - The use of XOR encryption is a well-known method for obfuscating data, and it aligns with the T1027.013 technique of using encryption to protect files or data.
   - The combination of API hooking and encryption/encoding is a strong indicator that the backdoor is designed to be stealthy and resilient against detection.
