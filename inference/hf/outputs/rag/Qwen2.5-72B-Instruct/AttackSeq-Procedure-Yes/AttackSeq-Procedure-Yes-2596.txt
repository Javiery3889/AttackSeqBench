### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether HIDDEN COBRA (a known threat actor) is likely to use legitimate sites hijacked and repurposed as part of their global exfiltration network to host exfiltration nodes at various entities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for threat actors to send stolen data back to their servers.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:**
     - This technique involves stealing financial data, which aligns with the context of intercepting customer transaction data through malicious scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - HIDDEN COBRA is known for sophisticated and stealthy operations. Using legitimate sites hijacked and repurposed as exfiltration nodes is a common tactic to avoid detection and maintain a low profile. The diverse locations (Italian modeling agency, vintage music store from Tehran, family-run bookstore from New Jersey) suggest a deliberate effort to obfuscate the origin and nature of the exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that HIDDEN COBRA would not use such a method. However, given their known tactics and the need to exfiltrate data stealthily, this seems less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known tactics of HIDDEN COBRA, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that they would use legitimate sites hijacked and repurposed as part of their global exfiltration network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
