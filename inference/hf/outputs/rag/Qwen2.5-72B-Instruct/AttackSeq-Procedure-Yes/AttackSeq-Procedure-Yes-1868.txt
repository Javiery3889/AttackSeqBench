### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - A malicious document uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique.
     - This technique is leveraged via PowerShell to download and run encoded commands.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the document will then create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or scripts, often to download and run additional payloads.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to ensure that a program runs every time the system starts up.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Execution:**
     - The use of DDE via PowerShell to download and run encoded commands aligns with the T1559.002 technique. This is a common method for initial execution.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The creation of a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence aligns with the T1547.001 technique. APT28, like many advanced threat actors, often employs persistence mechanisms to maintain access to the victim's system.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that APT28 is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks, it is highly plausible that after achieving initial execution, they would take steps to ensure persistence. Creating a batch file and a registry entry are common methods to achieve this.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of APT28, it is likely that the document would create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
