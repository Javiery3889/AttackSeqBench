### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware, after collecting and exfiltrating information to Dropbox, will connect to a C&C server and use Dropbox API for command and control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. In this case, the malware is using Dropbox to exfiltrate collected information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves using a web service (like Dropbox) for bidirectional communication, meaning the malware can both send data to and receive commands from the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services (like Dropbox) for C&C operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The malware has already used Dropbox to exfiltrate information, which aligns with the T1020-Automated Exfiltration technique.
     - The T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication technique suggests that the malware can use Dropbox for both sending data and receiving commands.
     - The T1102-Web Service technique further supports the use of Dropbox for C&C operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the malware does not use Dropbox for C&C operations, which contradicts the T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication and T1102-Web Service techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the malware will connect to a C&C server and use Dropbox API for command and control operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
