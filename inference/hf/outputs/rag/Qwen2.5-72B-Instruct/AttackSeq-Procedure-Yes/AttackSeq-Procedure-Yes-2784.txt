### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by iOS malware:
     - **Discovery Phase:** The malware collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** The malware sends the gathered information, writes log messages, uses a token for communication, and uploads files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the malware gathering text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is part of the initial information gathering process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The malware collects information (T1005) and discovers files and directories (T1083). This aligns with the initial steps described in the question.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - After collecting the data, it is common for malware to send the gathered information back to the attacker's server. This is a typical C2 activity.
     - Writing log messages and using a token for communication are also common in C2 to maintain persistence and secure communication.
     - Uploading files is another typical C2 activity, often used to exfiltrate data or receive additional commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the malware will perform the subsequent actions during the C2 phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
