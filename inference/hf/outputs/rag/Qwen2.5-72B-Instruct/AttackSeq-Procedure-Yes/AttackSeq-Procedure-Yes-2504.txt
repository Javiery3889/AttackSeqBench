### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT3 uses a zero-day vulnerability disclosed in the Hacking Team data leak to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor via phishing emails.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, while GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This technique involves collecting email addresses for use in phishing campaigns.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT3 and SHOTPUT Backdoor:**
     - APT3 is known for using sophisticated techniques, including zero-day vulnerabilities and spearphishing.
     - The SHOTPUT backdoor is a known tool used by APT3.
     - SHOTPUT backdoors often use hardcoded CnC addresses to maintain communication with the attacker.
   - **APT18 and GH0ST RAT:**
     - APT18 is known for using phishing campaigns to deliver malware.
     - GH0ST RAT is a known tool used by APT18.
     - GH0ST RAT typically communicates with CnC servers controlled by APT18.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the known behaviors of APT3 and APT18, it is plausible that:
     - APT3 would use a zero-day vulnerability and spearphishing to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor, which would communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses.
     - APT18 would use a phishing campaign to deliver GH0ST RAT, which would call out to an APT18 CnC address.
