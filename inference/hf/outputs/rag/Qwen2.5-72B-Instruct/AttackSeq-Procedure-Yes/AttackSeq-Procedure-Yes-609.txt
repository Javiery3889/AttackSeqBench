### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers:
     - Deploy worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     - Exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - Abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     - Achieve their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003 - Malicious Image:**
     - This technique involves using malicious images, such as container images, to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001 - Compute Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking compute resources, often for cryptocurrency mining.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access by exploiting exposed Docker API ports. This aligns with the T1204.003 technique, which involves using malicious images to gain initial access.
   - **Execution of Cryptocurrency Mining Scripts:**
     - The question states that attackers abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts. This aligns with the T1496.001 technique, which involves compute hijacking for cryptocurrency mining.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical:
       1. Gain initial access using exposed Docker API ports.
       2. Use command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
       3. Achieve the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is likely that attackers will abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts before achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
