### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files.
   - It then asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware to overwrite files as part of data destruction activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the adversary destroying data to disrupt availability or conceal their actions.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves the adversary deleting files to cover their tracks and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are both tools that can be used for data destruction, which aligns with the T1485-Data Destruction technique.
     - The sequence described in the question (awaiting commands, sending recon information, downloading files) suggests a multi-stage attack where the final stage could involve data destruction.
     - The use of 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' to overwrite files fits the context of data destruction and aligns with the T1485 technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Agrius is not likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction.
     - However, given the context of the attack sequence and the related TTPs, this choice seems less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware to overwrite files as part of its data destruction activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
