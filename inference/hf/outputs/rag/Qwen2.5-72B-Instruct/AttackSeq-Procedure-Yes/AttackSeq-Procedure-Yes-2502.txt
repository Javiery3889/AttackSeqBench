### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers use spear-phishing emails with malicious document attachments to gain initial access and execute RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware like RevengeRAT.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites during their operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and RAT Execution:**
     - The use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments (T1566.001) is a common method for gaining initial access to a target system.
     - Once the attackers gain initial access, they can deploy RAT malware like RevengeRAT to establish a persistent presence and gain remote control over the compromised system.
   - **Collection of Credit Card Information from OTA Websites:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA websites.
     - While RATs like RevengeRAT can be used to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including data exfiltration, the specific focus on collecting credit card information from OTA websites is not a typical or primary goal of such attacks.
     - Attackers using RATs often have broader objectives, such as stealing sensitive data, espionage, or maintaining long-term access to the network. Collecting credit card information from OTA websites would be a more specialized and targeted activity that is not commonly associated with the initial stages of a RAT-based attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations, given the broader and more common objectives of RAT-based attacks.

**Final Answer: B: No**
