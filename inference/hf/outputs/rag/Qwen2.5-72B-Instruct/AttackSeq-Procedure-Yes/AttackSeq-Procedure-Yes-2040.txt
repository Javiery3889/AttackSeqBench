### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Iranian threat actors will use fake personas and falsified identities to connect with US officials on social media to gather victim identity information during the Reconnaissance phase, and then use spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages for Initial Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves creating and using social media accounts to support the development of resources for an attack.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves using social media accounts to establish and maintain a presence that can be used to support the development of resources for an attack.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.001-Social Media:** This technique involves using social media to gather information about potential victims.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The techniques T1585.001 and T1586.001 both involve creating and using social media accounts to establish fake personas and falsified identities. This aligns with the first part of the question where Iranian threat actors establish fake personas and create falsified identities.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The technique T1593.001 involves using social media to gather information about potential victims. This aligns with the second part of the question where the threat actors connect with US officials on social media to gather victim identity information.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The question mentions using spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages for Initial Access. This is a common technique used by threat actors to gain initial access to a victim's system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (establishing fake personas, connecting with US officials on social media to gather information, and then using spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages) is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs.
   - The related TTPs support each step of this sequence, making it a likely scenario for Iranian threat actors.
