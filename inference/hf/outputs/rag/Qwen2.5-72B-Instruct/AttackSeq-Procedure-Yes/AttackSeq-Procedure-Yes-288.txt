### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Dropping Elephant will use spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.
   - The sequence of actions described is:
     1. Targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information.
     2. Using spear-phishing emails with malicious documents to gain initial access.
     3. Executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with links to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Targeting Diplomatic and Economic Entities:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks, especially for state-sponsored groups like Dropping Elephant, which often target specific organizations to gather intelligence.
   - **Using Spear-Phishing Emails with Malicious Documents:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that spear-phishing with attachments (T1566.001) is a known technique for gaining initial access. This aligns with the use of malicious documents in spear-phishing emails.
   - **Executing UPX-Packed Backdoors:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a common practice for attackers to use packed or obfuscated malware to evade detection. UPX is a popular packer used for this purpose.
   - **Downloading Additional Malware:**
     - Once initial access is gained, it is typical for attackers to download additional malware to further compromise the system and achieve their objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in cyber-attacks, it is likely that Dropping Elephant will use spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
