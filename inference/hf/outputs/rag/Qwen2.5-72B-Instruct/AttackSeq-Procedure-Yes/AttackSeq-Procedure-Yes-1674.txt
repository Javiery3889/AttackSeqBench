### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise, followed by using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves an attacker using various methods to identify remote systems on a network. The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView is a specific tool that can be used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves an attacker compromising a legitimate website to deliver malicious content to victims when they visit the site. The SocGholish framework is a known tool used for drive-by compromises.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):**
     - The SocGholish framework is commonly used to deliver malware via compromised legitimate websites. This aligns with the initial access phase of the attack.
   - **Discovery (T1018-Remote System Discovery):**
     - After gaining initial access, attackers often need to discover other systems on the network to further their objectives. The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView is a powerful tool for this purpose.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the typical attack flow:
     1. **Initial Access:** Use the SocGholish framework to compromise a legitimate website and deliver malware to the victim.
     2. **Discovery:** Once the initial access is established, use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView to discover other systems on the network.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
