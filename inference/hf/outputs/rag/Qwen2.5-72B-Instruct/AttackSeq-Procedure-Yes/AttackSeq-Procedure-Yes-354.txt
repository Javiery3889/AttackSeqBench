### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have used Defense Evasion techniques (T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls) to avoid detection before employing Discovery techniques (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files, directories, or other artifacts in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting the trust mechanisms of a system, such as code signing, to make malicious activities appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036 and T1553):**
     - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique is commonly used to avoid detection by making malicious files or processes appear as legitimate system components. This is a crucial step in the initial stages of an attack to ensure that the malware can operate undetected.
     - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique is used to bypass security mechanisms that verify the integrity and authenticity of software. By subverting trust controls, attackers can ensure that their malicious activities are not flagged by security systems.
   - **Discovery (T1057 and T1012):**
     - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
     - **T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system configuration and installed software.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The SolarWinds attackers are known for their sophisticated and stealthy approach. They would likely use Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection before engaging in Discovery activities.
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** and **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** are both effective in ensuring that the initial malware and subsequent activities remain undetected.
   - Once the attackers have successfully evaded detection, they would then proceed to use **T1057-Process Discovery** and **T1012-Query Registry** to gather information about the system and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
