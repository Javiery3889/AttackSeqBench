### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the SideWinder APT group after gaining initial access via a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-2215) through malicious apps on Google Play.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group used additional exploits from the C&C server to root devices for privilege escalation and then employed techniques to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. In this case, the vulnerability is CVE-2019-2215, which was used to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves using additional exploits to gain higher privileges on the compromised system. The question mentions using CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU to root devices, which aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The group used CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access, which is consistent with the T1190 technique.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The group then used additional exploits (CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU) to root devices, which is consistent with the T1068 technique.
   - **Evasion:**
     - The question mentions techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection. These are common tactics used by APT groups to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is likely that the SideWinder APT group used these techniques to escalate privileges and evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
