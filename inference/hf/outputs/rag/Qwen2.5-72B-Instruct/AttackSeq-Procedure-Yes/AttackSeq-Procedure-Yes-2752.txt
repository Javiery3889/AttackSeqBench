### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary spoofs banks in CIS countries to deliver a phishing email containing a ZIP archive named `dog.zip`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the SOCKSBOT infection chain will establish persistence using a PowerShell script `setup.ps1` and later use `checkupdate.ps1` containing a PowerShell reflective loader script for further execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that the attack starts with a phishing email containing a ZIP archive. This aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.
   - **Execution:**
     - The question then mentions the use of PowerShell scripts (`setup.ps1` and `checkupdate.ps1`). This aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question specifically mentions that the `setup.ps1` script is used to establish persistence. This is a common tactic in malware infection chains to ensure the malware remains on the system even after a reboot.
   - **Further Execution:**
     - The `checkupdate.ps1` script containing a PowerShell reflective loader script is used for further execution. Reflective loading is a technique where malware loads itself into memory without touching the disk, which is a common method to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described attack sequence with the related TTPs, it is plausible that the SOCKSBOT infection chain will follow the described steps.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
