### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware WinDealer:
     - Discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.
     - Staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.
     - Collecting data from removable media and targeting relevant folders.
     - Exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection**
   - **Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting data from the local system and staging it in a specific location before exfiltration. The %TEMP% folder is a common location for staging data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the data.
     - Given the T1074.001 technique, it is plausible that WinDealer would collect data from various sources, including removable media and relevant folders, and stage it in the %TEMP% folder before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will not collect data from removable media and target relevant folders.
     - This is less likely given the context of the T1074.001 technique, which involves collecting and staging data from various sources.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that WinDealer will collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
