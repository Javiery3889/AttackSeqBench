### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where exploit code is disguised within legitimate scripts on a compromised website (Daily NK) to evade detection. It then asks if the BLUELIGHT malware is likely to use the Microsoft Graph API for command and control (C2) operations by performing OAuth2 token authentication and setting up a directory structure in OneDrive.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves naming or placing files, directories, or other system objects in a way that makes them appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1189 - Drive-by Compromise (Initial Access):** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver exploit code to victims when they visit the site.
   - **T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication (Command and Control):** This technique involves establishing a communication channel that allows the attacker to send commands to the compromised system and receive data back.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This aligns with the part of the question where exploit code is disguised within legitimate scripts to evade detection.
   - **T1189 - Drive-by Compromise:** This aligns with the initial access method of compromising the Daily NK website to deliver the exploit code.
   - **T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication:** This aligns with the use of a command and control (C2) mechanism. However, the specific mention of using the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations and setting up a directory structure in OneDrive is not directly covered by this TTP.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the BLUELIGHT malware will use the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations, which involves OAuth2 token authentication and setting up a directory structure in OneDrive.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the BLUELIGHT malware will not use the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations in the described manner.

### Final Reasoning
- The related TTPs provide strong evidence for the initial stages of the attack (disguising exploit code and drive-by compromise). However, the specific use of the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations and setting up a directory structure in OneDrive is not directly supported by the given TTPs.
- While it is possible that the malware could use such advanced techniques, the provided TTPs do not explicitly mention these specific actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
