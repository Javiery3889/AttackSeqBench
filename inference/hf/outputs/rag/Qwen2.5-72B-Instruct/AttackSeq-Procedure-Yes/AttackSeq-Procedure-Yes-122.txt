### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Agrius.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting public-facing applications (CVE-2018-13379) for initial access.
     - Using webshells for tunneling RDP traffic.
     - Leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement.
     - Communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions exploiting public-facing applications (CVE-2018-13379) for initial access, which aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Webshells for Tunneling RDP Traffic:**
     - Webshells are often used to maintain persistence and can be used to tunnel RDP traffic, which is a common technique for lateral movement.
   - **Leveraging Compromised Accounts for Lateral Movement:**
     - The T1021.001 technique (RDP) is mentioned, which is a common method for lateral movement. Leveraging compromised accounts is a typical way to authenticate and use RDP.
   - **Communicating with C2 Servers using the 'IPsec Helper' Backdoor over HTTP:**
     - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a specific tool that can be used to communicate with C2 servers. Using HTTP for C2 communication is a common technique to blend in with normal traffic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The use of webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement are common post-exploitation techniques.
   - The communication with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP is a specific and plausible method for maintaining command and control.
