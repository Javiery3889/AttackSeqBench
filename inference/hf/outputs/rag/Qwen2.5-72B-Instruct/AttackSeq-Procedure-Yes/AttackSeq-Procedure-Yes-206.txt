### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information (usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types) during the Discovery phase after dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries collecting information about the system, such as usernames, computer names, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves adversaries using tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information after dumping credentials.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after gaining credentials, an adversary would want to gather more information about the system to understand the environment and identify valuable targets for further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow is not likely to collect system information after dumping credentials.
     - This is less plausible because collecting system information is a common step in the Discovery phase to facilitate further actions such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of adversaries, it is more likely that FamousSparrow would collect system information after dumping credentials to better understand the environment and identify valuable targets.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
