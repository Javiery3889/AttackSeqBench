### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Emissary Panda group:
     - Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.
     - Performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit.
     - Used the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
   - **Technique: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems and move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploitation and Persistence:**
     - Emissary Panda exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells. This is a common initial access and persistence technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit for lateral movement. EternalBlue is a well-known exploit for the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which is a remote service.
     - The related TTP T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) aligns with the use of EternalBlue for lateral movement.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The HyperBro backdoor is used to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS. This is a common technique for maintaining command and control over compromised systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The use of webshells for persistence, followed by lateral movement using stolen credentials and EternalBlue, and then using a backdoor for C2 communication, is a logical and common attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
