### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT35 used a spear phishing email to gain initial access to a corporate device.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the detection of Command and Control (C2) activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves using a spear phishing email with a malicious link.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves using a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that APT35 used spear phishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the question.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Detection:**
     - The question mentions that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process following the detection of C2 activity.
     - Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is designed to automate the detection and investigation of threats, including C2 activity.
     - It is common for advanced security solutions like Darktrace to automatically investigate and respond to detected C2 activity to prevent further damage and to gather more information about the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the capabilities of Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst and the typical response to detected C2 activity, it is likely that the investigation process was automated.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
