### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the driver (CEIDPageLock) is likely to connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration during the process of tampering with the browser after collecting victim browsing data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target:**
     - This technique involves using a drive-by download to compromise a victim's system. This is often the initial infection vector.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server. This is a common method for maintaining control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's browser, such as history, bookmarks, and cookies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Infection (T1608.004-Drive-by Target):**
     - The initial infection vector is likely a drive-by download, which could be used to deploy the CEIDPageLock driver.
   - **Browser Information Discovery (T1217-Browser Information Discovery):**
     - Once the driver is installed, it collects victim browsing data, which aligns with the question's context.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS):**
     - After collecting browsing data, it is plausible that the driver would connect to C&C hard-coded domains to exfiltrate the data or receive further instructions.
   - **Downloading Homepage Configuration:**
     - Downloading the homepage configuration is a form of tampering with the browser, which could be part of the C&C communication to modify the victim's browser settings.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the driver will connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration during the process of tampering with the browser after collecting victim browsing data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
