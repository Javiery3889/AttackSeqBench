### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors conducted research on the targets before sending phishing emails with malicious attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to specific targets. Spearphishing is a targeted form of phishing where the attacker has some knowledge about the target to make the email more convincing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors conducted research on the targets before sending the phishing emails. This aligns with the nature of spearphishing, where the attacker needs to gather information about the target to craft a convincing email.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors did not conduct research on the targets before sending the phishing emails. This is less likely for spearphishing, as the lack of research would make the emails less effective and less convincing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the nature of spearphishing, it is highly likely that the threat actors conducted research on the targets to craft convincing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
