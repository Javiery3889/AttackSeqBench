### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete malware, after gaining initial access via spearphishing emails with malicious compressed files, will list all nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command before copying files from local systems and removable media for collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network connections and devices, which can include listing Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.004-Evil Twin:** This technique involves setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point to capture sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery:** This technique involves discovering nearby Wi-Fi networks, which is a more specific form of network discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The question states that Machete malware gains initial access via spearphishing emails with malicious compressed files. This aligns with the initial access tactic.
   - **Wi-Fi Discovery:** The question asks if the malware will list all nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command. The related TTPs include T1016.002 (Wi-Fi Discovery), which is relevant to this step.
   - **File Collection:** The question also mentions copying files from local systems and removable media for collection. This aligns with the collection tactic, but the specific technique is not mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Wi-Fi Discovery:** The related TTPs indicate that Wi-Fi discovery is a known technique used in the discovery phase. This suggests that listing nearby Wi-Fi networks is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - **File Collection:** While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention file collection, it is a common next step after discovery to gather sensitive information.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions (initial access, discovery, and collection), it is plausible that Machete malware would list nearby Wi-Fi networks before copying files.
