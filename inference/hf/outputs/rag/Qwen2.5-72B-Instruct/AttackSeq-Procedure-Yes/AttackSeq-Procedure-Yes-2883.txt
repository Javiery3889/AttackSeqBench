### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will query registry values using functions like `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` after evading defenses using `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, and before establishing command and control (C2) through HTTP/HTTPS communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This TTP indicates that querying the registry is a common discovery technique used by threat actors to gather information about the system and its configuration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses:**
     - The functions `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64` are often used to manipulate memory and evade detection mechanisms. This is a common initial step in many attacks to ensure the malware can run without being detected.
   - **Querying Registry:**
     - After evading defenses, it is logical for threat actors to gather more information about the system. Querying the registry (using `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue`) is a common discovery technique to understand the system's configuration, installed software, and other relevant details.
   - **Establishing Command and Control:**
     - Once the threat actors have gathered the necessary information, they will typically establish a C2 channel to communicate with their command server. Using HTTP/HTTPS with specific headers like `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="upload_file"; filename="%s"` is a common method for this.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs, it is highly likely that threat actors will query registry values as part of their discovery tactics after evading defenses and before establishing C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
