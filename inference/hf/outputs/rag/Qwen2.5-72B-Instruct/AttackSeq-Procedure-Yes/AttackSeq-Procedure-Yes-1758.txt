### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Shuckworm, after executing VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain persistence and deploying additional variants of Pterodo, will likely establish command and control (C2) using HTTP requests and interacting with C2 servers like deep-pitched.enarto.ru before downloading additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to establish and maintain C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Shuckworm will indeed use HTTP requests to interact with C2 servers and download additional payloads.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** Shuckworm can use HTTP requests to communicate with C2 servers.
       - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** Shuckworm can use multiple stages of communication, which aligns with the sequence of executing scripts, deploying variants, and then establishing C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Shuckworm will not use HTTP requests to interact with C2 servers and download additional payloads.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1071.001 and T1104 indicate that HTTP requests and multi-stage communication are common in C2 operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that Shuckworm will establish C2 using HTTP requests and interact with C2 servers before downloading additional payloads.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
