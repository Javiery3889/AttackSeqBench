### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media, notify the C&C about these files, compress the collected files, and then send them to the C&C server after obtaining local IP address and system time through discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, system information, and other data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question mentions that the backdoor first obtains the local IP address and system time. This is a common initial step in many attacks to gather basic information about the compromised system.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique aligns with the backdoor collecting files from newly inserted removable media.
     - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique aligns with the backdoor compressing the collected files.
     - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique is not directly relevant to the specific sequence described in the question, as it focuses on collecting data from the local system rather than removable media.
   - **C&C Notification and Exfiltration:**
     - The question mentions notifying the C&C about the collected files and then sending them to the C&C server. This is a logical sequence of actions after collecting and compressing the data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (collecting files from removable media, notifying the C&C, compressing the files, and sending them to the C&C) is consistent with the related TTPs T1025 and T1560.
   - The initial discovery phase (obtaining local IP address and system time) is a common and logical first step in many attacks.
