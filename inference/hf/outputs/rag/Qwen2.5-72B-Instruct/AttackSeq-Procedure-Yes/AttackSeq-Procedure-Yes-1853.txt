### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of a decoy document, the use of an SFX executable, and the behavior of the VERMIN malware.
   - The specific actions in question are:
     - Decryption of an embedded resource using a brute force method.
     - Collection of the OS name via a WMI query as part of discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force**
     - This technique involves attempting to guess or crack passwords or other credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the OS name, version, and other details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Decryption of an Embedded Resource Using a Brute Force Method:**
     - The related TTPs do not directly mention decryption or embedded resources. However, T1110 (Brute Force) could be relevant if the malware is attempting to decrypt a resource by brute-forcing a password or key.
   - **Collection of OS Name via WMI Query:**
     - T1082 (System Information Discovery) is directly relevant to collecting system information, which includes the OS name. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a common method for gathering this information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if the VERMIN malware is likely to decrypt an embedded resource using a brute force method before collecting the OS name via a WMI query.
   - While T1110 (Brute Force) could be relevant to the decryption step, it is not explicitly mentioned in the context of the VERMIN malware's behavior in the question.
   - T1082 (System Information Discovery) is directly relevant to the collection of the OS name via a WMI query, which is a common discovery activity for malware.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The VERMIN malware is likely to collect the OS name via a WMI query as part of its discovery activities, but the question does not provide strong evidence that it would decrypt an embedded resource using a brute force method before doing so. The related TTPs support the discovery activity but not the brute force decryption.
