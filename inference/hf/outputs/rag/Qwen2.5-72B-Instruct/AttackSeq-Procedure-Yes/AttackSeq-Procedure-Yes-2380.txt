### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether LightNeuron, after discovering system network configurations, is likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering network configuration details, which aligns with the initial action of LightNeuron using functions like `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting data from the local system, which could include emails and local files.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of collected data, which aligns with the eventual exfiltration via backdoor functions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that LightNeuron is likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** (Discovery) is the initial step.
       - **T1005-Data from Local System** (Collection) follows, where the adversary collects emails and local files.
       - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** (Exfiltration) is the final step, where the collected data is exfiltrated.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that LightNeuron is not likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as the TTPs clearly indicate a sequence of discovery, collection, and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that LightNeuron is likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
