### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. The attacker performed reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure.
     2. The CARBANAK RAT beaconed to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.
     3. The PowerShell RAT communicated with the domain `hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate`.
     4. Data exfiltration was executed using the SmartFTP Client.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:**
     - This technique involves scheduling data exfiltration at specific times to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Data Discovery:**
     - The use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery is common in advanced attacks. Cobalt Strike is a popular tool for these purposes.
   - **CARBANAK RAT Beaconing:**
     - CARBANAK RAT is known for its ability to beacon to a C2 server, which aligns with the T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
   - **PowerShell RAT Communication:**
     - PowerShell RATs are often used for communication with C2 servers, which also aligns with T1041.
   - **Data Exfiltration Using SmartFTP Client:**
     - Using a legitimate tool like SmartFTP for data exfiltration is a common tactic to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection. This aligns with the T1029 technique (Scheduled Transfer) if the exfiltration is scheduled.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The use of different tools (Cobalt Strike, CARBANAK RAT, PowerShell RAT, and SmartFTP) for different stages of the attack is a common strategy in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
