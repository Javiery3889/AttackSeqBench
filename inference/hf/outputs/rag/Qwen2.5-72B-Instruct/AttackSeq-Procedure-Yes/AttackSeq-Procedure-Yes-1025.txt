### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Gamaredon group is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data before uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data.
     - The related TTPs T1025 and T1039 directly support this by indicating that the group collects data from removable media and network shared drives.
     - T1083, which involves discovering files and directories, further supports the idea that the group would scan all drives to identify potential targets for data collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon is not likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as T1025 and T1039 specifically mention the collection of data from removable media and network shared drives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data before uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
