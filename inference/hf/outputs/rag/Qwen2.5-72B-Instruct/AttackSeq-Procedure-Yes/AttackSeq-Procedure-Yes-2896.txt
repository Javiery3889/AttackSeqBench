### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the 'yty' framework uses a football-themed strategy to disguise its C2 (Command and Control) communication.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the framework will exfiltrate data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots back to the C2 server using plugins like 'abode.exe'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
   - This TTP indicates that the exfiltration of data is performed over the same channel used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the framework will exfiltrate data using the same C2 channel and plugins like 'abode.exe'.
     - Given the TTP T1041, it is common for malware to use the same C2 channel for both receiving instructions and exfiltrating data.
     - The use of plugins like 'abode.exe' for exfiltration is also plausible, as malware often uses various tools and plugins to perform different tasks, including data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the framework will not exfiltrate data using the same C2 channel and plugins like 'abode.exe'.
     - This is less likely given the TTP T1041, which specifically mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the TTP T1041 and the common practice of using the same C2 channel for both communication and exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that the framework will exfiltrate data using the same C2 channel and plugins like 'abode.exe'.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
