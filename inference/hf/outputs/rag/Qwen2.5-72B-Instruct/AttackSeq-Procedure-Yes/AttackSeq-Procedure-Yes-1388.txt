### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Raccoon stealer, after collecting system and account information as well as crypto wallet data, will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion before communicating with these C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the compromised system. This can include using different protocols or services to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves using a communication channel that supports both sending and receiving data, which is typical in C&C operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Raccoon stealer will use Telegram to receive encrypted C&C server addresses and then communicate with these servers using Telegram features.
     - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique supports the idea of using multiple stages of communication, which aligns with the scenario of using Telegram to receive C&C server addresses and then communicating with them.
     - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique supports the idea of using a bidirectional communication channel, which is consistent with using Telegram for both receiving and sending data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Raccoon stealer will not use Telegram to receive encrypted C&C server addresses or communicate with them using Telegram features.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which suggest the use of multi-stage and bidirectional communication channels.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that Raccoon stealer will use Telegram to receive encrypted C&C server addresses and communicate with them using Telegram features.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
