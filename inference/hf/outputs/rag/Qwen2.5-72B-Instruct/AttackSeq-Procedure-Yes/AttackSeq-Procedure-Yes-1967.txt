### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities in the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The campaign used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery activities to identify Active Directory information.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering domain trust relationships, which can help the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally through the network, which can be done using both privileged and non-privileged accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery activities aligns with the T1482 technique, which is part of the Discovery tactic. This helps the attacker gather information about the network and identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement Phase:**
     - The T1021.001 technique (RDP) is a common method for lateral movement. It is plausible that the threat actor would use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment.
     - Privileged accounts would provide more access and control, while non-privileged accounts might be used to avoid detection or to maintain a low profile.
   - **Access to Information Repositories:**
     - After moving laterally through the environment, the threat actor would likely access data from Information Repositories, which is a common final step in many cyber attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the StellarParticle campaign and the related TTPs, it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
