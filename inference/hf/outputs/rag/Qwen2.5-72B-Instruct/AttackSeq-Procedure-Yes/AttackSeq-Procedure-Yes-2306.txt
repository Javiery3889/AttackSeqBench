### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary, after using Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials, will copy the results of the discovery phase (such as local file and directory lists) in preparation for exfiltration after achieving collection by gathering data from local systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves an adversary staging data in a central location or directory on a local system before exfiltration. This is often done to make the exfiltration process more efficient.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005 - Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves an adversary collecting data from the local system, which can include files, directories, and other system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will indeed copy the results of the discovery phase (local file and directory lists) in preparation for exfiltration.
     - This aligns with the T1074.001 technique (Local Data Staging), which involves staging data before exfiltration.
     - It also aligns with the T1005 technique (Data from Local System), which involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will not copy the results of the discovery phase in preparation for exfiltration.
     - This does not align with the T1074.001 technique, which explicitly involves staging data before exfiltration.
     - It also does not align with the T1005 technique, which involves collecting data from the local system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions an adversary would take, the most plausible answer is that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase in preparation for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
