### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether INOCNATION malware, after using XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation for defense evasion, is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communications.
   - **T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC) to encrypt C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **XOR Obfuscation, Sandbox Detection, and String Stacking Obfuscation:**
     - These techniques are primarily used for defense evasion to avoid detection by security tools and analysts.
   - **Encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS:**
     - HTTPS is a standard web protocol (T1071.001) that uses SSL/TLS for encryption.
     - Using HTTPS for C2 communications is a common practice because it blends in with normal web traffic and is difficult to inspect without decrypting the traffic.
   - **Windows' Standard SSL/TLS Libraries:**
     - Malware often uses standard libraries to avoid detection and to leverage the built-in security features of the operating system.
   - **Asymmetric Cryptography (T1573.002):**
     - Asymmetric cryptography can be used to secure C2 communications, but it is not necessarily tied to the use of HTTPS. However, HTTPS can use asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC) for the initial handshake.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that INOCNATION malware has already employed various defense evasion techniques, it is logical to assume that it would also use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS for C2 communications to further evade detection and ensure secure communication.
   - The use of standard web protocols (T1071.001) and the potential use of asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) support this conclusion.
