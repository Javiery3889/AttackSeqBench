### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution after a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands or scripts. DDE is a method for inter-process communication in Windows.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic (VBA):** This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code. VBA is a powerful scripting language used in Microsoft Office applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Campaign:** The initial step in the attack sequence is a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT. Phishing is a common initial access vector used to deliver malware.
   - **Malicious VBA Script Execution:** After the RAT is delivered, it is plausible that the adversaries will use VBA scripts to execute further malicious activities. VBA scripts can be embedded in Office documents and are often used to establish C2 connections.
   - **C2 Connection:** Establishing a C2 connection is a critical step for adversaries to maintain control over the compromised system and to perform further actions such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or additional malware deployment.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs (T1559.002 and T1059.005) indicate that adversaries can use VBA scripts to execute code and establish C2 connections.
   - Given that the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is known for its capabilities in establishing C2 connections, it is highly likely that the adversaries will use VBA scripts to achieve this.
   - The sequence of events (phishing campaign, delivery of RAT, and execution of VBA scripts to establish C2) is a common and logical progression in cyber attacks.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
