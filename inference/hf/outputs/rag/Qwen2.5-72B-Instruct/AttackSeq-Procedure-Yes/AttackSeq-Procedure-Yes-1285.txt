### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to load a malicious DLL (wab32res.dll) through a benign file during the Defense Evasion phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL by placing it in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate program.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to load and execute a malicious DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL through a benign file. It is a common method to maintain stealth and avoid detection by security software.
   - **Rundll32 (T1218.011):** This technique is often used to execute malicious code by leveraging the rundll32.exe utility, which is a legitimate Windows tool. It can be used to load and execute the malicious DLL loaded through DLL side-loading.

   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The question specifically asks about the use of SSL in the C2 phase. While the related TTPs focus on the Defense Evasion phase, the use of SSL in the C2 phase is a common practice to secure communications and evade network-based detection.
     - Tropic Trooper, like many advanced threat actors, often uses encrypted channels (such as SSL/TLS) to communicate with their C&C servers to avoid detection by network security tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that Tropic Trooper is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence, it is highly likely that they would use SSL to secure their C2 communications.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
