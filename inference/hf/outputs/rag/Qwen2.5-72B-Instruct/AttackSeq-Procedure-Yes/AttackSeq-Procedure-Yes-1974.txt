### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks are likely to gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts after using phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim organization, which can include details about the organization's structure, employees, and business operations.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses:** This sub-technique involves gathering email addresses of individuals within the victim organization, which can be used for further phishing attacks.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.002-Business Relationships:** This sub-technique involves gathering information about the victim organization's business relationships, which can be used to target the organization's supply chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the related TTPs. The techniques T1591, T1589.002, and T1591.002 all involve gathering information about the victim organization, which is a common step in reconnaissance efforts. After gaining initial access through phishing emails, threat actors often gather more detailed information to plan further attacks, including targeting the supply chain.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs. The techniques listed clearly indicate that gathering victim organization information is a crucial step in the attack sequence, especially for sophisticated attacks like those targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that threat actors are likely to gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
