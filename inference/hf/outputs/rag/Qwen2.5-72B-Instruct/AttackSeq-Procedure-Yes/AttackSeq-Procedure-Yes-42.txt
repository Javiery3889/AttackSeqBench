### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether KONNI malware is likely to steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before uploading the stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves the malware collecting data from the local system, which can include files, documents, and other sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the malware sending the collected data back to the C2 server over the established communication channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before exfiltrating the data.
     - The related TTP T1005 (Data from Local System) supports this, as it indicates that the malware collects data from the local system.
     - The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) further supports this, as it indicates that the collected data is then exfiltrated to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not steal files from the local system as part of its collection process.
     - This is less likely given the presence of T1005, which explicitly states that the malware collects data from the local system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is that the malware will steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before exfiltrating the data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
