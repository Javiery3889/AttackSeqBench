### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the `netd` component of the Infamous Chisel malware, after enumerating directories and gathering system information during the discovery phase, will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery**
   - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system. This is typically done to identify files or directories of interest for further actions, such as exfiltration or modification.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The `netd` component is described as enumerating multiple directories and gathering system information. This aligns with the T1083 technique, which is part of the Discovery tactic. The purpose of this phase is to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question asks if the `netd` component will automatically collect files based on a predefined list of file extensions. The T1083 technique does not inherently include the collection of files; it is focused on discovery.
     - Collection of files based on predefined extensions is a separate action that typically follows the discovery phase. It is part of the Collection tactic, which involves gathering data of interest from the system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The `netd` component's primary function in the discovery phase is to enumerate directories and gather system information. While this information can be used to identify files of interest, the automatic collection of files based on predefined extensions is a distinct step that is not directly implied by the T1083 technique.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the `netd` component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: B: No
