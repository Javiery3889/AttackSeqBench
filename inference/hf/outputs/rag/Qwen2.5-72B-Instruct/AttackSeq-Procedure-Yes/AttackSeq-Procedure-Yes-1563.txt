### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sunburst backdoor, after being delivered through a supply-chain attack, is likely to communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique indicates that the adversary uses web protocols (such as HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique describes the method used to gain initial access by compromising the software supply chain, which is how the Sunburst backdoor was delivered.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Sunburst backdoor, once installed, needs to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions and commands. The use of web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) is a common and effective method for C2 communication because it can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the Sunburst backdoor would not communicate with its C2 server using a protocol. This is unlikely because the backdoor needs a way to receive commands and exfiltrate data, and web protocols are a standard method for this communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need for the backdoor to communicate with its C2 server, the most plausible answer is that the Sunburst backdoor will indeed use a protocol for further exploitation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
