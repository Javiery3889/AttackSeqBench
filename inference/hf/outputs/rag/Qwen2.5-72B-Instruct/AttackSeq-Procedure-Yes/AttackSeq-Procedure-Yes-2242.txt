### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether MuddyWater is likely to use compromised servers to host malicious code as part of their Command and Control (C2) operations after using compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. This can include using different servers or channels for different stages of the attack.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system. This is often used to download additional malware or tools needed for further stages of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique suggests that MuddyWater might use multiple servers or channels for different stages of the attack. This aligns with the idea of using compromised servers to host malicious code for C2 operations.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique indicates that MuddyWater downloads files from external systems to the compromised system. This is consistent with the initial access method described in the question (downloading files infected with macros).

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that MuddyWater uses compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access, it is logical to assume that they would continue to use compromised servers to host malicious code for C2 operations. This aligns with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique, which suggests the use of multiple servers for different stages of the attack.
   - The T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer technique further supports this by indicating that MuddyWater transfers tools and files from external systems, which can include compromised servers.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
