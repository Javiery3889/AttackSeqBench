### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks.
     - **Execution:** Deploying the Cobalt Strike loader disguised as a system update service.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Discovery
     - **Technique:** T1046-Network Service Discovery
   - This indicates that the question is specifically asking about the discovery phase and the use of network service discovery techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The initial access and execution phases are well-documented in the question. Earth Lusca uses spear phishing and malicious JavaScript to gain initial access and then deploys the Cobalt Strike loader.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase is the next logical step after gaining initial access and executing the payload.
     - The related TTP T1046-Network Service Discovery is a technique used to identify network services and their configurations, which is a common activity during the discovery phase.
   - **Tools for Network Service Discovery:**
     - HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan are tools that can be used to discover network services.
     - These tools are commonly used by threat actors to map out the network and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that Earth Lusca will use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
