### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to use dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2) infrastructure after staging data for exfiltration using compression tools and remote command execution scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data for exfiltration, often using compression tools and remote command execution scripts.
   - **T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels for C2, which can include dynamic-DNS domains.
   - **T1071.004 - DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2, which can include dynamic-DNS domains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Remote Data Staging (T1074.002):** This is consistent with the initial part of the question where data is staged for exfiltration using compression tools and remote command execution scripts.
   - **Multi-Stage Channels (T1104):** This technique suggests that APT10 might use multiple stages of communication, which can include dynamic-DNS domains.
   - **DNS (T1071.004):** This technique specifically mentions the use of DNS for C2, which can include dynamic-DNS domains.

   - **Robocopy and PSCP:**
     - **Robocopy:** This is a file copying tool, which is not typically used for C2 but can be used for data exfiltration.
     - **PSCP (Putty Secure Copy Client):** This is a tool for secure file transfer, which can be used for data exfiltration but not typically for C2.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of using dynamic-DNS domains for C2 after data staging. The related TTPs (T1104 and T1071.004) strongly suggest that APT10 does use dynamic-DNS domains for C2.
   - The tools mentioned (Robocopy and PSCP) are more relevant to data exfiltration rather than C2, but this does not contradict the use of dynamic-DNS for C2.
