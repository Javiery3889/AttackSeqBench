### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will demand ransom payments for the return of compromised Instagram accounts after locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information or funds, which can include demanding ransom payments.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts:** This technique involves gaining access to accounts, which can include social media accounts like Instagram.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This sub-technique specifically involves compromising email accounts, which can be used to reset passwords and gain control of other accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will demand ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1657-Financial Theft** indicates that attackers may engage in financial theft, which can include ransom demands.
       - **T1586-Compromise Accounts** and **T1586.002-Email Accounts** show that the attackers have the capability to gain control of accounts and lock out the original owners.
       - It is plausible that after gaining control of Instagram accounts, attackers might demand ransom payments to return the accounts to their rightful owners.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not demand ransom payments.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While it is possible that attackers might not demand ransom payments, the related TTPs suggest that financial theft and account compromise are common tactics.
       - The combination of these TTPs makes it more likely that attackers would seek to monetize their access to the compromised accounts, potentially through ransom demands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely scenario is that the attackers will demand ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
