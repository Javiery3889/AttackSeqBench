### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the KerrDown DLL is likely to execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic after decoding and executing a base64 encoded blob.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the adversary decoding or deobfuscating files or information to make the payload executable.
   - **T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This sub-technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute the payload in the context of that process, which is a common method for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This is relevant because the question mentions decoding a base64 encoded blob, which aligns with this technique.
   - **T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This is relevant because the question asks about executing the payload in memory using process injection, which is a form of dynamic-link library injection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves decoding a base64 encoded blob, which aligns with T1140.
   - After decoding, the question asks if the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection, which aligns with T1055.001.
   - Both techniques are part of the Defense Evasion tactic, which is consistent with the context of the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
