### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Machete malware:
     - Collects data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media.
     - Stages the collected data in a temporary folder.
     - Uses standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers.
     - Implements fallback channels for network traffic if the standard ports are not available.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using ports other than the well-known default ports for communication.
   - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using standard file transfer protocols like FTP and HTTP for data exfiltration.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary ones are not available.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Machete will use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers before implementing fallback channels.
     - This aligns with the T1071.002 technique, which involves using standard file transfer protocols.
     - It also aligns with the T1008 technique, which involves using fallback channels if the primary ones are not available.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Machete will not use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers before implementing fallback channels.
     - This does not align with the T1071.002 technique, which specifically mentions the use of standard file transfer protocols.
     - It also does not align with the T1008 technique, which suggests the use of fallback channels as a secondary measure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that Machete will use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers before implementing fallback channels.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
