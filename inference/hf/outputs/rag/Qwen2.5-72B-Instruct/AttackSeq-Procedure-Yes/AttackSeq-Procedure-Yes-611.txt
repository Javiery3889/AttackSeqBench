### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use various tools for reconnaissance and brute force authentication.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use specific tools for identifying internal hosts and remotely controlling software during Initial Access, followed by attempts to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which is a common step in the Discovery phase.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their versions, which is also part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 are used for reconnaissance to enumerate services and authenticate via brute force. This aligns with the initial steps of the attack.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The related TTPs T1018 and T1046 suggest that the next logical step after reconnaissance is to discover remote systems and network services.
     - Tools like Advanced IP Scanner and Radmin can be used for remote system discovery and network service discovery, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - PushVNC package can be used for remotely controlling software, which is a common technique for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **Defense Evasion Phase:**
     - Using AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat to evade defenses is a common technique in the Defense Evasion phase, which typically follows after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Using tools for service enumeration and brute force authentication.
     2. **Discovery:** Using tools for remote system and network service discovery.
     3. **Initial Access:** Using tools for remote control.
     4. **Defense Evasion:** Using scripts to evade defenses.
   - This sequence aligns well with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the related TTPs provided.
