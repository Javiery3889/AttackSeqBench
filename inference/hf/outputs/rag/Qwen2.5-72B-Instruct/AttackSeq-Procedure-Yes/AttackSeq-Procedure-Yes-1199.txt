### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Energetic Bear will compromise a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack to conduct a watering hole attack, after targeting software suppliers for PLC components during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves placing malicious content on a website that the target is likely to visit, often through a watering hole attack.
   - **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This is a specific sub-technique of T1195 where the attacker compromises the software supply chain to deliver malicious software to the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Energetic Bear targets software suppliers for PLC components. This aligns with the T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain technique, as they are likely targeting the supply chain to gain access to the target organization.
   - **Supply Chain Compromise:**
     - After targeting the software suppliers, Energetic Bear compromises the Turkish energy company's website. This aligns with the T1195-Supply Chain Compromise technique, as they are using the compromised supplier to gain access to the target.
   - **Watering Hole Attack:**
     - The compromised website is then used to conduct a watering hole attack, which aligns with the T1189-Drive-by Compromise technique. This involves placing malicious content on a website that the target is likely to visit.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. Energetic Bear uses a supply chain attack to compromise the software supplier, then uses the compromised website to conduct a watering hole attack targeting Turkish critical infrastructure.
