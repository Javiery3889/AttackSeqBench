### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access through a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome.
   - The attacker then exploits a Use-After-Free (UaF) condition with heap spraying to execute code.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will establish persistence by installing tasks using Windows Task Scheduler before connecting to the C2 server and downloading next-stage modules.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to establish persistence, ensuring that the malware runs at specific intervals or upon certain triggers.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges on the system, which can be necessary for installing tasks or performing other actions that require administrative rights.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Code Execution:**
     - The attacker gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome.
     - The UaF condition with heap spraying is used to execute code, which is a common technique for gaining code execution in such vulnerabilities.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The related TTP T1053.005 (Scheduled Task) is directly relevant to establishing persistence.
     - It is common for malware to use the Windows Task Scheduler to ensure it runs periodically or at system startup, which aligns with the question's description.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The related TTP T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) suggests that the malware might need to gain higher privileges to install tasks or perform other actions.
   - **C2 Communication and Next-Stage Modules:**
     - After establishing persistence, it is typical for malware to connect to a C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional modules.
     - This sequence is logical and aligns with common malware behavior.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible. The use of a zero-day vulnerability to gain initial access, followed by code execution, persistence via scheduled tasks, and then C2 communication and module downloading, is a well-documented and logical sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
