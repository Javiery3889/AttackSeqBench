### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SombRAT backdoor, after performing process discovery and system information discovery, is likely to communicate with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to encapsulate C2 traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique specifically involves using DNS to communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs indicate that the SombRAT backdoor could use protocol tunneling (T1572) and DNS (T1071.004) for C2 communication.
     - Protocol tunneling over DNS is a common technique used by malware to establish a covert C2 channel, especially when standard network traffic is closely monitored.
     - Given that the backdoor has already performed discovery activities, it is logical for it to establish a C2 channel to exfiltrate data or receive further commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor would not use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication.
     - However, the related TTPs and the nature of advanced malware like SombRAT make this less likely, as these techniques are commonly used to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, the most plausible sequence is that the SombRAT backdoor would use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
