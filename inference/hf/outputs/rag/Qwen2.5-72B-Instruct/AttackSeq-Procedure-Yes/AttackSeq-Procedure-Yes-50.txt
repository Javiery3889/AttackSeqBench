### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker evades defenses by operating in memory and using a specific DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - It then asks if it is likely that a PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used for various malicious activities, including communication with C2 servers and downloading payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Operating in Memory and Using DCOM:**
     - Operating in memory and using DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) to execute files without saving them to disk is a common technique used by advanced malware to evade detection. This is often seen in fileless malware attacks.
   - **PowerShell Script:**
     - PowerShell is frequently used by attackers to perform various malicious activities, including communication with C2 servers and downloading additional payloads. This is a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Ursnif and GandCrab:**
     - Ursnif is a banking trojan known for stealing sensitive information, and GandCrab is a ransomware family. Both are known to use PowerShell for their operations, including communication with C2 servers and downloading additional payloads.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the TTPs described (operating in memory, using DCOM, and using PowerShell), it is highly likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. This aligns with the known behaviors of these types of malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
