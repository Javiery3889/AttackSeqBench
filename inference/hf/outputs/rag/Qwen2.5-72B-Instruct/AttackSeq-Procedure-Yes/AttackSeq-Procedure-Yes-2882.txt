### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries, after using functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` to manipulate memory and processes to evade detection, will package and transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS to a command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the adversaries will use HTTP/HTTPS to transmit data to a C2 server.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** indicates that HTTP/HTTPS is a common method for C2 communication.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** indicates that data exfiltration often occurs over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the adversaries will use HTTP/HTTPS to transmit data to a C2 server.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1071.001 and T1041 indicate that HTTP/HTTPS is a common method for both C2 communication and data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is likely that the adversaries will use HTTP/HTTPS to transmit data to a C2 server after evading detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
