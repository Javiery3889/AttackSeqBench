### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where data is exfiltrated using SmartFTP Client during the Collection phase, and then RYUK ransomware is deployed a week later using both manual and scripted methods, including remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec during the Impact phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration using SmartFTP Client:**
     - This is a common method for exfiltrating data during the Collection phase. SmartFTP Client is a legitimate file transfer tool that can be used to transfer data out of a network.
   - **Deployment of RYUK Ransomware:**
     - RYUK ransomware is known for being deployed manually and through scripted methods. It often involves a multi-stage attack where initial access is gained, and then the ransomware is deployed after a period of time to maximize impact.
   - **Remote Code Execution using WMI and PsExec:**
     - WMI and PsExec are both common tools used for remote code execution and lateral movement. WMI is used to execute commands on remote systems, and PsExec is a tool that allows for the execution of processes on other systems.
   - **Timing:**
     - The question mentions that the ransomware is deployed a week after the data exfiltration. This is a plausible timeline, as attackers often wait to ensure they have full control and have exfiltrated all desired data before deploying ransomware to maximize the impact and leverage for ransom.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of events, it is plausible that RYUK ransomware would be deployed a week later using both manual and scripted methods, including remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec during the Impact phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
