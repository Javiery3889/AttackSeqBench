### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers modified a Javascript file on a CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006 - HTML Smuggling:** This technique involves smuggling malicious content within HTML documents or elements to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the use of various methods to obfuscate files or information to make it harder for defenders to detect or analyze the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTML Smuggling (T1027.006):** While this technique is related to defense evasion, it specifically involves smuggling malicious content within HTML documents. The question, however, is about obfuscating and encoding the malicious code within a Javascript file, not HTML.
   - **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027):** This technique is more relevant to the question. It involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. The use of Dean Edwards Packer to encode the malicious code is a form of obfuscation.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the question specifically mentions obfuscating the malicious code and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer, which is a known method for obfuscation, the most plausible answer is that the attackers did indeed obfuscate the code for defense evasion.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
