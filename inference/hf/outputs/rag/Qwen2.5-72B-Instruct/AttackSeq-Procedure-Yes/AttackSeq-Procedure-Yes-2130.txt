### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a script named 'stopedge.bat' is used to delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means of defense evasion.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the same script will contribute to persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code periodically.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of scheduled tasks in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Deleting Files)**: The script 'stopedge.bat' is used to delete files, which is a common technique to remove traces of the attack and evade detection.
   - **Persistence (Scheduling Tasks)**: The related TTPs indicate that scheduling tasks is a common technique for maintaining persistence. The technique T1053.005 (Scheduled Task) is mentioned twice, suggesting it is a significant part of the attack sequence.
   - **Combining TTPs**: It is plausible that after evading defense mechanisms by deleting files, the attacker would want to ensure the malware remains on the system. Scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs' would achieve this by creating a persistent mechanism.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is likely that the script 'stopedge.bat' will contribute to persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
