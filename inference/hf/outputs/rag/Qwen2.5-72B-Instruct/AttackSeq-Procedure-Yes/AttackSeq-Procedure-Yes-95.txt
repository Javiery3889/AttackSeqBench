### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The attack starts with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file.
   - The HTA file is then used to check for installed antivirus software using WMI.
   - The FinalBot backdoor is executed with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 (Command and Control) server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, CVE-2017-11882 in an RTF document) to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - The attack starts with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file. This aligns with T1203.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):**
     - The question asks if the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server using web protocols. This aligns with T1071.001.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The HTA file is dropped and used to check for antivirus software.
     - The FinalBot backdoor is executed with DLL sideloading.
     - It is reasonable to assume that the FinalBot backdoor, once executed, will need to communicate with the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - Using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) is a common method for C2 communication, and leveraging a domain like webserv-redir.net is a plausible way to obfuscate the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described, it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
