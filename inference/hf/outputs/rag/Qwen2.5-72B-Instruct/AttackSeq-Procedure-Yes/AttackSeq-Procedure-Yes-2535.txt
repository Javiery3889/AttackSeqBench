### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Deep Panda:
     - Gaining persistence by copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
     - Creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry.
   - The question then asks if Deep Panda is likely to use the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion, which employs Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to protect malicious artifacts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying code signing policies to allow the execution of unsigned or malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to change system behavior or hide malicious activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service):**
     - The question mentions that Deep Panda creates a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification):**
     - This technique is not directly mentioned in the question, but it is a common method for defense evasion.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1112-Modify Registry):**
     - The question mentions modifying the registry to create the service, which aligns with this technique.

4. **Evaluate the Use of Fire Chili Rootkit:**
   - The Fire Chili rootkit is known for its use of Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to protect malicious artifacts.
   - DKOM is a sophisticated technique that involves modifying kernel objects to hide processes, files, and other system artifacts.
   - While the question does not explicitly mention the use of DKOM, it is a plausible next step for a sophisticated threat actor like Deep Panda to use advanced rootkits for defense evasion.

### Final Answer
Given the sophisticated nature of Deep Panda and the use of advanced techniques for persistence and defense evasion, it is plausible that they would use the Fire Chili rootkit for further defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
