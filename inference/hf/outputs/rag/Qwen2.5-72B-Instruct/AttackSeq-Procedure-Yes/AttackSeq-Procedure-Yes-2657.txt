### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the communication behavior of the Korplug variant after it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - Specifically, it asks if Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves the use of protocols that are not typically used for application-level communication, such as raw TCP or UDP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for communication, with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.
     - The use of a custom TCP-based protocol aligns with the T1095 technique (Non-Application Layer Protocol).
     - The initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP is a plausible scenario, as it combines elements of both T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Korplug does not use the described communication method.
     - Given the related TTPs, this choice is less likely, as it does not align with the techniques mentioned.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the described communication method, the most likely answer is that Korplug does use a custom TCP-based protocol with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
