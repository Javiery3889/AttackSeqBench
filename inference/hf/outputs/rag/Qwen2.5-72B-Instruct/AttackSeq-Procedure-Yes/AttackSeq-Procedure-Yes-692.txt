### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Pierogi backdoor, after conducting discovery activities, is likely to communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers using predefined URLs to send machine information and receive commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the malware is collecting system information such as the computer name, username, and operating system version.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The malware has already conducted discovery activities, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This phase helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - After collecting system information, it is highly likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers. This communication is essential for the attacker to:
       - Send the collected information back to the attacker.
       - Receive further commands to execute additional actions.
   - **Predefined URLs:**
     - Using predefined URLs for C2 communication is a common technique. These URLs are often hardcoded into the malware to ensure reliable communication with the C2 infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the discovery activities and the typical behavior of malware, it is highly likely that the Pierogi backdoor will communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs to send machine information and receive commands.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
