### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers are likely to exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems after the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
   - **Technique: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using the "Exploitation of Remote Services" technique to achieve lateral movement. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs, as T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) is a common technique used for lateral movement. Once the attackers have moved laterally, they can then install additional persistence points on the new systems to maintain access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that attackers will not exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as the technique T1210 is specifically about exploiting remote services for lateral movement, which is a crucial step before installing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
