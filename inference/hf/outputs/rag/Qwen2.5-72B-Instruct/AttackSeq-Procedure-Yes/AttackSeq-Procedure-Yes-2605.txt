### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the NanHaiShu malware:
     - Establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry to point to the network.js file.
     - Gathering system information, including the Volume Serial Number and IP Address.
     - Uploading the collected system information to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to ensure that a malicious file (in this case, network.js) runs at system startup, establishing persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the Volume Serial Number and IP Address, which is often done to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The first step in the question, modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry, aligns with the T1547.001 technique. This is a common method for ensuring that the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - The second step, gathering system information, aligns with the T1082 technique. This is a typical action taken by malware to understand the environment and potentially exfiltrate useful data.
   - **Uploading Collected Information:**
     - The third step, uploading the collected information to the C&C server, is a logical follow-up to the discovery phase. Malware often sends this information back to the attacker to help in further decision-making or to confirm the success of the infection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is highly likely that NanHaiShu would gather system information after establishing persistence and then upload it to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
