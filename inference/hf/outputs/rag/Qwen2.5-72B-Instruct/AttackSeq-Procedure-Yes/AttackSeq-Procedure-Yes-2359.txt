### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the MuddyWater APT group.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether the group used a web control server and the muddyc3 tool for command and control (C2) operations after gaining initial access through spear-phishing attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. It suggests that the attackers might use different tools or servers at different stages of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the download of malware or the execution of a malicious payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The MuddyWater APT group is known to use spear-phishing attacks to gain initial access to target systems. This aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - After gaining initial access, the group would need to establish a command and control (C2) channel to maintain control over the compromised system.
     - The use of a web control server and the muddyc3 tool for C2 operations is a plausible next step. The muddyc3 tool is known to be used by MuddyWater for C2 purposes.
     - The web.py script, which processes client requests and delivers next-stage payloads, is also a logical step in the attack sequence, as it would be used to manage the compromised systems and deliver additional malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the known behavior of the MuddyWater APT group, it is likely that they used a web control server and the muddyc3 tool for C2 operations after gaining initial access through spear-phishing attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
