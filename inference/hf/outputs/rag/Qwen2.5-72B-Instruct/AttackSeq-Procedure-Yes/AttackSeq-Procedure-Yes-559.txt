### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether malware is likely to collect basic information such as IP address and hostname during the discovery phase after bypassing User Account Control (UAC) through a .NET technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary collecting information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary collecting information about the system, such as the hostname, operating system version, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to collect basic information such as IP address and hostname during the discovery phase.
     - The related TTPs T1016 and T1082 directly support this. T1016 involves collecting network configuration information, which includes IP addresses, and T1082 involves collecting system information, which includes the hostname.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to collect basic information such as IP address and hostname during the discovery phase.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1016 and T1082 indicate that collecting such information is a common and logical step in the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical attack, the malware is likely to collect basic information such as IP address and hostname during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
