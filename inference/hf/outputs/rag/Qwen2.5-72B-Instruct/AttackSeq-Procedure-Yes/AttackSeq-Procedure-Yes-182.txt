### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities performed by the threat actor "Infamous Chisel."
   - The activities include:
     - Using the `netd` component to discover files of interest from data directories.
     - Performing GPS information collection.
     - Deploying `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic.
     - Exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:**
     - This technique involves using tools like `tcpdump` to capture and analyze network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can include using Tor and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of `netd` to discover files of interest and GPS information collection aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Network Sniffing:**
     - Deploying `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic is a clear example of the T1040-Network Sniffing technique.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections aligns with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question logically follows the related TTPs.
   - The use of `tcpdump` for network sniffing (T1040) and the exfiltration of files using Tor and SSH (T1041) are both consistent with the described activities.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
