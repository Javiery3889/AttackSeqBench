### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Longhorn, after using defense evasion techniques like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation, is likely to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations before engaging in detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the adversary using various methods to obfuscate files or information to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1027):** The question mentions that Longhorn uses techniques like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation, which are part of the defense evasion tactic. This is consistent with the T1027 technique.
   - **Discovery (T1082):** The question also asks if Longhorn is likely to perform system information discovery. This aligns with the T1082 technique, which is part of the discovery tactic.
   - **Sequence of Operations:** The question suggests a sequence where Longhorn first uses defense evasion techniques and then moves on to discovery operations. This is a logical sequence because adversaries often use defense evasion to avoid detection before performing discovery to understand the environment they are in.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of operations and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is plausible that Longhorn would perform system information discovery after employing defense evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
