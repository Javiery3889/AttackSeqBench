### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs: exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells, using RDP for lateral movement, and then asks if the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be used to exfiltrate data to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a common step in the attack lifecycle before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending stolen data back to the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting Public-Facing Applications and Uploading Webshells:** This is a common initial access and persistence technique.
   - **Using RDP for Lateral Movement:** This is a common technique for moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems.
   - **Backdoor 'IPsec Helper':** The question specifically mentions the backdoor 'IPsec Helper.' While the name 'IPsec Helper' might suggest a legitimate security tool, in the context of malware, it could be a backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate service.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** This technique aligns with the use of a backdoor to exfiltrate data. Backdoors are often designed to facilitate communication with C2 servers, which is a key part of the exfiltration process.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described (initial access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration), it is plausible that a backdoor like 'IPsec Helper' would be used to exfiltrate data to C2 servers. The related TTPs (T1005 and T1041) support this sequence, as they describe the collection of data and its exfiltration over a C2 channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
