### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where actors first run discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems. Then, it asks if it is likely that the actors used webshells for lateral movement by dumping credentials with a Mimikatz variant and using Impacket's atexec tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts (Persistence):** This technique involves using existing domain accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **T1550.002-Pass the Hash (Lateral Movement):** This technique involves using stolen password hashes to authenticate to remote systems.
   - **T1003.001-LSASS Memory (Credential Access):** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, often using tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The initial discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems align with the reconnaissance phase of an attack. This is a common first step to understand the environment.
   - **Credential Dumping:** Using a Mimikatz variant to dump credentials from LSASS memory (T1003.001) is a well-known technique for credential access. This aligns with the related TTP.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using the dumped credentials for lateral movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash) is a common next step. Impacket's atexec tool can be used to execute commands on remote systems using these credentials.
   - **Webshells:** Webshells are often used to maintain persistence and execute commands on a compromised web server. However, the question does not explicitly mention the use of webshells in the context of lateral movement. The related TTPs focus more on credential access and lateral movement techniques.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (discovery, credential dumping, and lateral movement) is highly plausible and aligns well with the related TTPs. However, the use of webshells for lateral movement is not directly supported by the related TTPs, which focus more on credential-based techniques.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible, but the specific mention of webshells for lateral movement is not strongly supported by the related TTPs provided. The related TTPs focus more on credential access and lateral movement using stolen credentials.
