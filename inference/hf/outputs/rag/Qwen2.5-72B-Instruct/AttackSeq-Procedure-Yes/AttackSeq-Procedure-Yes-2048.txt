### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Charming Kitten, after creating fake websites to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase, is likely to target non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves creating fake social media accounts to gather information or credentials.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves creating fake email accounts to gather information or credentials.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate entities to gain trust and access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Charming Kitten has already created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials. This indicates a sophisticated and targeted approach to gather initial access credentials.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The next logical step in an attack sequence would be to use the obtained credentials to gather more information about potential targets.
     - Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists is a common tactic in the Reconnaissance phase to gain trust and access to additional information or networks.
   - **Impersonation (T1656):**
     - The use of impersonation aligns with the goal of gathering more detailed information about non-Iranian researchers, which can be used for further attacks or to refine the initial attack vectors.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Charming Kitten's initial activities and the common use of impersonation in the Reconnaissance phase, it is likely that they would target non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
