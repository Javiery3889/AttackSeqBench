### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server after establishing contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data without manual intervention. This could include scripts or tools that automatically collect and send data to a C2 server.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. This is a common method for attackers to send stolen data back to their servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after establishing contact with C2 servers and downloading shell scripts, attackers might use automated exfiltration techniques (T1020) to collect and send AWS credentials back to the C2 server (T1041).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that it is not likely that attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials. However, the related TTPs indicate that automated exfiltration and exfiltration over C2 channels are common techniques used by attackers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common attack patterns, it is likely that attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server as part of their attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
