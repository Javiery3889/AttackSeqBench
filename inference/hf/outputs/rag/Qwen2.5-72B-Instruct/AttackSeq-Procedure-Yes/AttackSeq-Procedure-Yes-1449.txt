### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FoggyWeb, after passively monitoring HTTP GET and POST requests for custom URI patterns as part of Command and Control, is likely to exfiltrate the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates while also having the capability to download additional components from a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - FoggyWeb is known to use web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communications, which aligns with T1071.001.
     - FoggyWeb can also impersonate legitimate protocols or services, which aligns with T1001.003.
     - FoggyWeb has been observed to exfiltrate sensitive data such as configuration databases and cryptographic certificates.
     - FoggyWeb has the capability to download additional components from a C2 server, which is a common feature in advanced malware to maintain persistence and update its capabilities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that FoggyWeb does not exfiltrate the specified data or download additional components, which contradicts the known capabilities of FoggyWeb as described in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the known capabilities of FoggyWeb, the most plausible answer is that FoggyWeb is likely to exfiltrate the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates while also having the capability to download additional components from a C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
