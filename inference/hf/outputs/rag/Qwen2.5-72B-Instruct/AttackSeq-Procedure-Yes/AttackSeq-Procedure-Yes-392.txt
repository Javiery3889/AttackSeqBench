### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from the computer after obtaining system information and then compress them with zlib for transmission to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as computer name, OS version, architecture, and IP address. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **T1005 - Data from Local System:** This technique involves the adversary collecting data from the local system, which could include files, documents, and other sensitive information. This aligns with the second part of the question.
   - **T1560.002 - Archive via Library:** This technique involves the adversary compressing collected data using a library, such as zlib, to reduce the size and make it easier to transmit. This aligns with the third part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will collect files from the computer after obtaining system information and then compress them with zlib for transmission.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1082** (System Information Discovery) is the first step.
       - **T1005** (Data from Local System) is the second step.
       - **T1560.002** (Archive via Library) is the third step.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not collect files from the computer after obtaining system information and compressing them with zlib for transmission.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate a sequence of discovery, collection, and compression.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor will indeed collect files from the computer after obtaining system information and then compress them with zlib for transmission.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
