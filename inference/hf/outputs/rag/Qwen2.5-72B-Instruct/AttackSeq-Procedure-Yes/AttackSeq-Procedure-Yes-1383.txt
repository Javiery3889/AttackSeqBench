### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery after using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.005-Scan Databases:** This technique involves using tools to scan and gather information about databases and other network services. Tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which can include discovering outdated systems and medical devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered.
     - Given the use of tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys, which are designed to scan and identify network services, it is highly likely that these tools will discover various services, including outdated systems and medical devices.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered.
     - This is less plausible because the tools mentioned are specifically designed to identify a wide range of network services, and medical devices and outdated systems are common targets in medical infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the capabilities of the tools mentioned, the most plausible answer is that it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
