### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28, after using spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access, will execute exploit documents to install malware like GAMEFISH and then use tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, can lead to the download of malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or download and run malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with attachments that, when opened, can execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 is known to use spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access. The related TTPs T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) and T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) confirm this.
   - **Execution:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, the next step is to execute the exploit documents. The related TTP T1559.002 (Dynamic Data Exchange) can be used to execute commands or download and run malicious content.
   - **Malware Installation:**
     - After executing the exploit documents, APT28 is likely to install malware like GAMEFISH on the victim systems.
   - **Leveraging Tools:**
     - Once the malware is installed, APT28 can use tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE to further their operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known behavior of APT28, the sequence described in the question is plausible. APT28 is likely to execute the exploit documents to install malware and then use additional tools during their operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
