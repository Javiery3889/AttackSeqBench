### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT42 is likely to use encrypted channels for command and control (C2) communications after exfiltrating data over C2 channels.
   - The data exfiltrated includes recorded phone calls and SMS inboxes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** indicates that the data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - APT42, being a sophisticated threat actor, is likely to use encrypted channels for C2 communications to avoid detection and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of their commands and exfiltrated data.
   - Using encrypted channels is a common practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations to protect the C2 infrastructure and the data being exfiltrated.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophistication of APT42 and the nature of the data being exfiltrated, it is highly likely that they will use encrypted channels for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
