### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Trickbot will perform virtualization/sandbox evasion by exhibiting anti-analysis characteristics after executing a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file that drops the Trickbot payload and creates a copy of itself as Shell.jse in the Startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
   - These TTPs indicate that Trickbot is known to use virtualization/sandbox evasion techniques to avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Trickbot is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, including virtualization/sandbox evasion. The sequence described in the question (executing a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file, dropping the payload, and creating a copy in the Startup folder) aligns with Trickbot's behavior of evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Trickbot would not perform virtualization/sandbox evasion, which contradicts the known behavior of Trickbot and the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Trickbot will indeed perform virtualization/sandbox evasion after executing the heavily obfuscated JavaScript file and dropping the payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
