### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SombRAT backdoor, after performing process discovery and system information discovery, is likely to communicate with C2 servers using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY to implement protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique involves the use of proxies to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:**
     - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network defenses or to hide the nature of the traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will use proxy tools and protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers.
     - The related TTPs T1090 (Proxy) and T1572 (Protocol Tunneling) directly support this scenario. Using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY aligns with the T1090 technique, and implementing protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP aligns with the T1572 technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will not use proxy tools and protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that using proxies and protocol tunneling are common techniques in the Command and Control phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical attack, the most plausible answer is that the SombRAT backdoor will use proxy tools and protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
