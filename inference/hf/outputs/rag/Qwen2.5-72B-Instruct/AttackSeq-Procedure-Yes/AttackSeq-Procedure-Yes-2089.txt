### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers, after obtaining domain administrative credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints through discovery, aimed to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the attackers initially gained access using domain accounts.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This suggests that the attackers used domain accounts to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the attackers used domain accounts to escalate their privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If the attackers already have domain administrative credentials, they have a high level of access. However, it is common for attackers to ensure they have multiple admin-level credentials to maintain access and resilience. They might still look for additional admin-level credentials to ensure they can move laterally and maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the attackers already have domain administrative credentials, they might not need to find additional admin-level credentials to move across the entire infrastructure. However, this does not mean they would not do so, as having multiple credentials can provide redundancy and additional control.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attackers have already obtained domain administrative credentials and used them to compromise additional endpoints, it is plausible that they would still aim to find additional admin-level credentials. This is because having multiple admin-level credentials can provide redundancy and ensure that they can maintain access and move laterally even if one set of credentials is compromised or detected.
