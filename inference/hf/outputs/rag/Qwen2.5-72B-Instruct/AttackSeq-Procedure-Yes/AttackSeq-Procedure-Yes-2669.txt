### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information before initiating command and control (C2) communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like AES) to encrypt C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to gather system information before initiating C2 communication.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The T1082-System Information Discovery technique is part of the Discovery tactic, which is often used by adversaries to gather information about the victim's system before taking further actions.
       - Gathering system information can help the adversary tailor their C2 communication and make it more effective or less detectable.
       - It is common for backdoors to collect system information to send to the C2 server, which can be used for various purposes, such as identifying the victim, determining the next steps, or exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor is not likely to gather system information before initiating C2 communication.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the common behavior of backdoors, which often gather system information to better understand the victim's environment.
       - The T1082-System Information Discovery technique is directly relevant to the question, indicating that gathering system information is a typical step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the common behavior of backdoors, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to gather system information before initiating C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
