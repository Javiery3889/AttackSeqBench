### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers used Arabic language decoy documents to entice victims as part of their phishing strategy during the initial access phase.
   - The context is that the Scote malware provides backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a link that leads to a malicious website or file.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique is relevant to the initial access phase and involves tricking users into clicking links. However, it does not specify the use of decoy documents.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique is also relevant to the initial access phase and involves sending spearphishing emails with links. It is more specific to the use of links, but it does not mention the use of decoy documents.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique is relevant to the initial access phase and involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments. This is the most relevant technique for the use of decoy documents, as attachments can be used to entice victims.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the use of Arabic language decoy documents to entice victims. The most relevant technique for this is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, as it involves sending attachments that can be used to entice victims.
   - While the other techniques (T1204.001 and T1566.002) are also part of the initial access phase, they do not specifically mention the use of decoy documents.
