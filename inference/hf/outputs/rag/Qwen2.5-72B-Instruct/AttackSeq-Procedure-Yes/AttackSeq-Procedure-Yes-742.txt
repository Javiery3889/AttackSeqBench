### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a malware downloader app from a fraudulent website.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network topology.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was gained by tricking users into downloading a malware downloader app. This is a common method for initial compromise.
   - **Execution Phase:** The malware downloader would likely execute binaries to perform further actions. The use of a Windows Command Shell (T1059.003) is a plausible method for executing these binaries.
   - **Ingress Tool Transfer:** The malware downloader would need to retrieve additional tools, such as reconnaissance and RAT tools, to perform further actions. This aligns with the T1105 technique.
   - **Reconnaissance:** After retrieving the tools, the malware would conduct reconnaissance to gather detailed victim host information. The use of 'bird.exe' for this purpose is consistent with the T1590 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events described, it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
