### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that `advstoreshell.dll` will be used for encrypted communication with C&C servers via HTTP on port 443 or 80 after APT28 deploys `pr.dll` for data collection and uploads stolen information to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with C&C servers.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which can help evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This suggests that the communication with the C&C server is likely to use standard web protocols, which are HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This suggests that the communication might use non-standard ports, which are not 80 or 443.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - APT28 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain stealth and evade detection. While they might use standard web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication, they are also known to use non-standard ports to avoid detection by network security systems.
   - The question specifically asks about encrypted communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80. While HTTP on port 80 is not encrypted, HTTPS on port 443 is encrypted.
   - Given the related TTPs, it is more likely that APT28 would use HTTPS (port 443) for encrypted communication, but they might also use non-standard ports to further evade detection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of APT28's known tactics, it is likely that `advstoreshell.dll` will be used for encrypted communication with C&C servers via HTTPS on port 443, but not necessarily on port 80.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
