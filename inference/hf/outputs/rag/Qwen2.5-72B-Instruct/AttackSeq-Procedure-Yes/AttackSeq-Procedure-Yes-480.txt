### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Trickbot, after connecting to its Command and Control (C2) server to download and execute its payload, is likely to proceed to delete files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives as part of its impact tactics.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1070.004 - File Deletion**
   - This TTP indicates that file deletion is a technique used for defense evasion, which involves removing files to cover tracks or prevent detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Trickbot's Behavior:**
     - Trickbot is known for its modular nature and its ability to perform various malicious activities, including downloading and executing payloads from a C2 server.
     - Trickbot has been observed to engage in file deletion as part of its operations, but the specific context of deleting files with specific extensions from removable and network drives is not a common or well-documented behavior for Trickbot.
   - **Impact Tactic:**
     - The impact tactic typically involves causing damage or disruption to the target system. While file deletion can be part of an impact tactic, the specific focus on removable and network drives with specific file extensions is more aligned with ransomware or wiper malware, which are designed to cause widespread damage.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - File deletion (T1070.004) is primarily used for defense evasion to remove evidence of the attack, which is a common tactic for many malware families, including Trickbot. However, the specific targeting of removable and network drives with specific file extensions is not a typical defense evasion technique for Trickbot.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While Trickbot does use file deletion as a defense evasion technique, the specific behavior of deleting files with specific extensions from removable and network drives is not a common or well-documented behavior for Trickbot. This behavior is more characteristic of ransomware or wiper malware, which are designed to cause widespread damage.

### Final Answer: B: No
