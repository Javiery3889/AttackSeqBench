### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the 'yty' framework, after using specific plugins for document listing, keylogging, and screenshot capturing, is likely to exfiltrate the gathered data back to the C2 server using automated methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a compromised system.
   - **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data from a compromised system to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The 'yty' framework uses plugins to gather various types of data (file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots).
     - The related TTPs (T1020 and T1041) suggest that the framework is capable of and likely to use automated methods to exfiltrate the gathered data.
     - T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) directly supports the idea that the exfiltration process is automated.
     - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) indicates that the data is sent to a C2 server, which is a common method for exfiltration in many malware frameworks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the 'yty' framework does not use automated methods to exfiltrate data, which contradicts the related TTPs.
     - Given the use of specific plugins for data collection, it is highly unlikely that the framework would not have a mechanism to exfiltrate the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the 'yty' framework does use automated methods to exfiltrate the gathered data back to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
