### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Waterbear backdoor uses API hooking to modify `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` for defense evasion. It then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will load incoming executables after establishing communication with a C&C server using an XOR-encrypted address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to execute code. This is relevant because the backdoor might use native APIs to load and execute incoming executables.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or modifying indicators to evade detection. This is relevant because the backdoor is using API hooking to mask processes and TCP endpoints.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **API Hooking for Defense Evasion:**
     - The backdoor is using API hooking to modify `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable`. This is a common technique to hide processes and network activity from monitoring tools.
   - **Establishing Communication with C&C Server:**
     - After evading detection, it is common for malware to establish communication with a C&C server. Using an XOR-encrypted address is a typical method to obfuscate the C&C server's address and avoid detection.
   - **Loading Incoming Executables:**
     - Once communication is established, it is likely that the backdoor will download and execute additional payloads. This is a common behavior for backdoors to maintain persistence and perform further malicious activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the Waterbear backdoor will load incoming executables after establishing communication with a C&C server using an XOR-encrypted address.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
