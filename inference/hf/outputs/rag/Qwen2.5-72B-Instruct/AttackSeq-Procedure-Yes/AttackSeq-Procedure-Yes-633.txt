### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after privilege escalation using the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll`, the shellcode will contact a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ` and resolve the domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91` for further malicious activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting a dynamic-link library (DLL) into a process to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This is a broader technique that includes various methods of injecting code into a process to escalate privileges.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to resolve domain names to IP addresses, often used to avoid detection by using a static IP address for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The use of the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` for privilege escalation is consistent with the T1055.001 and T1055 techniques. This step is necessary to gain higher privileges on the target system.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question mentions contacting a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ` and resolving the domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91`. This aligns with the T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver technique, which is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses for C&C communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, it is plausible that after privilege escalation, the shellcode will contact the C&C server and resolve the domain to the IP address for further malicious activity.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
