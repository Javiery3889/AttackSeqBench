### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor LYCEUM.
   - Initial access is gained through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
   - DanBot malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
   - The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would use an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before executing arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, which aligns with the description of delivering DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Delivery of Malware:**
     - DanBot malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Use of DanDrop:**
     - DanDrop is an obfuscated macro tool that can be used to drop malware. Given that the initial delivery is via a malicious Excel attachment, it is plausible that an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop would be used to drop the DanBot malware.
   - **Execution of Arbitrary Commands:**
     - Once the malware is dropped, it is common for threat actors to use it to execute arbitrary commands, often via `cmd.exe`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is likely that LYCEUM would use an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before utilizing it for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
