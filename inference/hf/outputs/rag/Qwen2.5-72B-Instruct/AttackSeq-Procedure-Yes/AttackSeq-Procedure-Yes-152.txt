### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the PowerLess Backdoor, after achieving credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and utilizing a keylogger, is likely to target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:** This technique involves discovering local user accounts on a system, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The PowerLess Backdoor has already achieved credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and utilizing a keylogger. This aligns with the T1003 and T1003.001 techniques.
   - After gaining initial credentials, it is common for malware to perform further discovery to understand the environment and identify additional targets. This is where the T1087.001 technique (Local Account) comes into play.
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that after gaining initial credentials, the next logical step would be to discover local user accounts to potentially gain more access or to understand the system better.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical attack, it is likely that the PowerLess Backdoor will target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
