### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments to drop the Taidoor malware.
   - The attacker then opens a decoy document for initial access.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers using a modified traffic pattern.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - The TTPs T1203 and T1566.001 are consistent with the initial steps described in the question. The attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, leading to the execution of Taidoor malware.
   - **Evolution to Avoid Detection:**
     - Malware like Taidoor often evolves to avoid detection. This can include modifying its traffic patterns to avoid common network detection signatures.
     - The question specifically asks if Taidoor is likely to evolve to avoid detection before communicating with its CnC servers.
     - Given the nature of advanced malware, it is common for such malware to implement evasion techniques to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers using a modified traffic pattern.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
