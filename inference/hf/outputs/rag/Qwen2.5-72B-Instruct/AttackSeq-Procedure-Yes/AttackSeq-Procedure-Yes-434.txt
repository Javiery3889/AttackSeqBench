### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group's Delphi downloader:
     - Gaining execution.
     - Using Windows API to execute commands.
     - Sending gathered system information to the C&C server.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery by gathering process lists from the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information such as the operating system, hostname, and other details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about running processes on the victim's machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the Delphi downloader has already gathered system information and sent it to the C&C server. This aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of the AutoIt downloader performing process discovery, which aligns with the T1057-Process Discovery technique.
   - Given that the Sednit group is known for using multiple downloaders and stages in their attacks, it is plausible that after gathering system information, they would proceed to gather more detailed information about the victim's environment, including process lists.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of the Sednit group, it is likely that the AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery by gathering process lists from the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
