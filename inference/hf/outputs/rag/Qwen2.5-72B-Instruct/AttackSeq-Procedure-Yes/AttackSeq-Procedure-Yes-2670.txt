### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the OceanLotus group:
     - Achieving persistence by creating a Launch Agent.
     - Launching itself as a service from a new location.
     - Gathering system details.
     - Sending the information back to a command and control (C2) server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:**
     - This technique involves creating a Launch Agent to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a system process to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:**
     - This is a repetition of the first TTP, emphasizing the use of Launch Agents for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that OceanLotus uses Launch Agents to achieve persistence. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Gathering System Details:**
     - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention gathering system details, it is a common next step after achieving persistence. Attackers often gather system information to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Sending Information to C2:**
     - Sending gathered information to a C2 server is a typical behavior for backdoors. The use of a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys is a sophisticated method to secure communication and avoid detection.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns. After achieving persistence, gathering system details, and sending the information to a C2 server using a secure protocol is a plausible next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of OceanLotus.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
