### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM actors, after conducting reconnaissance, likely performed spear-phishing campaigns and hosted watering hole sites to deliver initial payloads before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website that the target is likely to visit, often referred to as a "watering hole" attack. The compromised website is then used to deliver malicious content to the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending targeted emails with links to malicious websites or files. The goal is to trick the target into clicking the link, which then delivers the initial payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The question mentions that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Spear-Phishing Campaigns:**
     - The related TTP T1566.002-Spearphishing Link aligns with the idea of sending targeted emails with links to deliver initial payloads. This is a common method for initial access.
   - **Watering Hole Sites:**
     - The related TTP T1189-Drive-by Compromise aligns with the idea of compromising a website that the target is likely to visit. This is another common method for initial access.
   - **Executing Trojans:**
     - The question mentions that after gaining initial access, the actors move forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy. This is a logical next step after initial access is achieved.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events described in the question, it is highly likely that ProjectM actors performed spear-phishing campaigns and hosted watering hole sites to deliver initial payloads before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
