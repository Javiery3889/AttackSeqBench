### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit is delivered via email.
   - The document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlackOasis will execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves an adversary exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or document reader) to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The malicious Microsoft Office document is delivered via email, which aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - The document contains a Flash zero-day exploit, which aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - **ActionScript:**
     - The Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit, which is a common method for executing the initial stage of the attack.
   - **Second Stage Shellcode:**
     - After the initial exploit is executed, it is common for attackers to deliver and execute a second stage payload (shellcode) to maintain control or perform further actions on the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in such attacks, it is highly likely that BlackOasis will execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
