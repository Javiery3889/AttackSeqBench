### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin, after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase, is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase involves gathering information about the target system, such as processes, memory utilization, and deleted files. This aligns with the initial actions described in the question.
   - **Network Sniffing (T1040):**
     - Network sniffing is a technique used to capture and analyze network traffic. This technique is often used for collection purposes, where the attacker gathers data from network communications.
   - **Regin's Capabilities:**
     - Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its advanced capabilities, including network sniffing. It has been observed to perform various forms of data collection, including monitoring network traffic.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that Regin is known to use network sniffing as part of its data collection capabilities and the related TTPs include network sniffing, it is highly likely that Regin would monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes after the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
