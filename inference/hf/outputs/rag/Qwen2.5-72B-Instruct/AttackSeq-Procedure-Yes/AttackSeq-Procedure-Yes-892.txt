### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 is likely to use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers after harvesting credentials through spear-phishing campaigns during the Credential Access phase, before moving deeper into the victim network in the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain initial access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1078-Valid Accounts):** APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials, which is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the question's context.
   - **Persistence (T1078-Valid Accounts):** After gaining initial access, APT28 can use the harvested credentials to maintain persistence in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services):** Once inside the network, APT28 can use known vulnerabilities to exploit remote services and move laterally to other systems.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - APT28 is known for using a combination of techniques to achieve their objectives. After gaining initial access and harvesting credentials, it is plausible that they would use these credentials to maintain persistence and then exploit known vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within the network.
   - The sequence described in the question (spear-phishing for credentials, then exploiting vulnerabilities for lateral movement) is a common and effective attack pattern for APT groups like APT28.
