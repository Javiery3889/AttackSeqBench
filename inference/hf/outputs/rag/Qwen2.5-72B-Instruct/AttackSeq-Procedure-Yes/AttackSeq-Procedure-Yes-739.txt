### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers, after using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, will verify victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompt for the 2-step verification code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to gain access to a victim's account.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information from victims.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending targeted phishing emails with links to gather information or credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique is directly related to intercepting or bypassing MFA, which aligns with the idea of verifying credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.
       - **T1598-Phishing for Information and T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** These techniques involve gathering credentials through phishing, which can be followed by real-time verification and MFA interception to gain full access to the account.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align well with the related TTPs, especially T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception, which implies that attackers would likely attempt to intercept or bypass MFA.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the attackers will verify victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompt for the 2-step verification code.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
