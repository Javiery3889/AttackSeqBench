### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Smooth Operator, after collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file during the discovery phase, is likely to parse and extract domain and account name values from the `3CX` file `config.json` during its collection stage before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery**
   - **Technique: T1082 - System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries collecting information about the system and its configuration, such as the operating system version, which is relevant to the first part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Collecting OS Version from `SystemVersion.plist`**
     - This aligns with the T1082 - System Information Discovery technique, where adversaries gather information about the system, including the OS version.
   - **Step 2: Parsing and Extracting Domain and Account Name Values from `3CX` File `config.json`**
     - The question implies that after discovering the OS version, Smooth Operator would then parse and extract domain and account name values from the `3CX` file `config.json`.
     - This step is part of the collection stage, where adversaries gather additional information that might be useful for further actions, such as exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - **Step 3: Performing HTTPS-based Communication with C2 Servers**
     - After collecting the necessary information, the adversary would likely use this information to communicate with the C2 servers, often over HTTPS to avoid detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After discovering the OS version, it is reasonable for an adversary to collect additional information from other files, such as `config.json`, before communicating with the C2 servers. This aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated malware, which often gathers as much information as possible to tailor its actions and avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
