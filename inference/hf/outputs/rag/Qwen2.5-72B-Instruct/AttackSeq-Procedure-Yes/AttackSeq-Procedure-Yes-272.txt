### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Helminth Trojan agent using a customized version of Mimikatz to gather information from the computer and the network.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the DnE1.Ps1 file will use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and IP address.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique is directly relevant to the question as it describes using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server. This aligns with the part of the question that mentions DNS exchange queries.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique is relevant to the initial part of the question where the Helminth Trojan agent uses Mimikatz to gather information from the computer and the network.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique is also relevant to the initial part of the question, as it involves using automated tools to collect data, which is consistent with the use of Mimikatz.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves gathering information (T1082 and T1119) and then using DNS to communicate with a C&C server (T1071.004). This sequence is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The question also mentions downloading a bat script for execution, which is a common follow-up action after establishing C&C communication.
