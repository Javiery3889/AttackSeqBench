### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the loader will gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase after employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques in the Defense Evasion phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery**
   - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering basic information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain. This information is crucial for the adversary to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Phase:**
     - The loader has already employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is a common initial step to ensure the malware can operate undetected.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - After evading defenses, the next logical step is to gather information about the victim's system. This is necessary to understand the environment and to plan subsequent actions, such as data collection and lateral movement.
   - **Technique T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique aligns with the need to gather basic system information, which is a typical first step in the Discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the loader will gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase after evading defenses.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
