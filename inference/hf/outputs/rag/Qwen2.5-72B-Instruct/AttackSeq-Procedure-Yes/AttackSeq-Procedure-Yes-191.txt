### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Infamous Chisel collects files based on predefined file extensions and gathers files from application and data directories.
   - It then asks whether the netd component is likely to exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of data, which aligns with the question's context of exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could include using Tor or SSH.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automatic collection of data, which aligns with the initial collection phase described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the netd component will exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
     - The related TTPs T1020 and T1041 support the idea of automated exfiltration and exfiltration over a C2 channel, which could include Tor and SSH.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the netd component will not exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
     - This choice would imply that the exfiltration method is different from the ones mentioned, which is not supported by the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the netd component will exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
