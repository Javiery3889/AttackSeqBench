### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word after conducting reconnaissance and before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves using a vulnerability in a client application (like Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute code remotely.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Spear Phishing:**
     - The attackers have already conducted reconnaissance and used spear phishing to gather information about their targets. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882:**
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word is a plausible next step. This technique aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which is part of the Execution tactic.
   - **Deployment of POWERSHOWER:**
     - After gaining initial access through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882, deploying a PowerShell backdoor like POWERSHOWER is a logical next step to maintain persistence and execute further activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, it is likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
