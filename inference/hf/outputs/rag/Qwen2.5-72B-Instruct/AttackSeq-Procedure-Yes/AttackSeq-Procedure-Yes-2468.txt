### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack that starts with sending a PDF attachment that appears benign and passes through security filters. The attack then uses legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment, which is a common method for initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear legitimate to avoid detection by security tools and users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described attack sequence is likely.
     - The initial access is achieved through a spearphishing attachment (T1566.001), which aligns with the PDF attachment described in the question.
     - The use of legitimate tools and scripts for operations aligns with the defense evasion technique of masquerading (T1036), where the attacker makes their actions appear benign to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described attack sequence is not likely.
     - However, the related TTPs clearly support the sequence described in the question, making this choice less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the attack sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the attack is likely to have occurred as described.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
