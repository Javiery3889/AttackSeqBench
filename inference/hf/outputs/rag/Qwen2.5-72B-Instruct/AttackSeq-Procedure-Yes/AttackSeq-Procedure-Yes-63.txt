### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ScarCruft is likely to use Ultra VNC Server on compromised hosts for information collection after using DLL Side-Loading to load evc.dll for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code. It is commonly used for defense evasion, allowing the attacker to run their code without being detected by security software.
   - **Ultra VNC Server:** This is a remote access tool that allows an attacker to control a compromised host remotely. It is often used for information collection and remote command execution.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This suggests that ScarCruft is likely to use Ultra VNC Server for information collection after using DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This suggests that ScarCruft is not likely to use Ultra VNC Server for information collection after using DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion.

5. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion (DLL Side-Loading):** Once the attacker has successfully evaded defenses using DLL Side-Loading, they would typically want to maintain control over the compromised host and collect information.
   - **Information Collection (Ultra VNC Server):** Using a remote access tool like Ultra VNC Server is a common next step after gaining initial access and evading defenses. It allows the attacker to interact with the compromised host, collect information, and potentially exfiltrate data.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the typical attack sequence, it is plausible that ScarCruft would use Ultra VNC Server for information collection after using DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
