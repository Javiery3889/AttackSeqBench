### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT-TOCS is likely to use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control (C2) operations after exhibiting lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement within a network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used for various purposes, including downloading and executing malicious scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer):** This technique is consistent with the initial part of the question, where APT-TOCS exhibits lateral movement through network projection. It suggests that the attacker is moving laterally within the network, likely transferring tools or files to other systems.
   - **Execution (T1059.001-PowerShell):** This technique is relevant to the second part of the question, where the attacker uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for C2 operations. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute scripts, making it a common tool for C2 operations.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that APT-TOCS has already exhibited lateral movement, it is plausible that the next step in the attack sequence would involve using PowerShell to download and execute scripts for C2 operations. PowerShell is a versatile tool that can be used to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, and communicate with the attacker's command and control server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
