### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a Russian-language phishing campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter.
     - Using malicious docx files containing obfuscated code.
     - Establishing communication with a compromised server for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - The question mentions a Russian-language phishing campaign, which aligns with the use of spearphishing attachments.
     - The malicious docx files containing obfuscated code are consistent with the technique of using spearphishing attachments to deliver malware.
   - **Command and Control (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels):**
     - The question also mentions establishing communication with a compromised server for command and control.
     - This aligns with the technique of using multi-stage channels to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs.
   - The use of spearphishing attachments to deliver malicious docx files and the subsequent establishment of command and control communication are both well-documented techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
