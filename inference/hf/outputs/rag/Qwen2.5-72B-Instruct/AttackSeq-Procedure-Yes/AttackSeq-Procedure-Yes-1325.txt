### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the CosmicDuke malware:
     - Searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types (discovery phase).
     - Using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
     - Exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves adversaries searching for and collecting data from removable media such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:**
     - This technique involves adversaries collecting data from the clipboard, which can include sensitive information that users have copied.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives.
     - The related TTPs T1025 and T1115 both fall under the Collection tactic, which aligns with the described sequence of actions.
     - It is plausible that after collecting data from removable media, CosmicDuke could also collect data from the clipboard to gather additional information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will not use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1115, which specifically mentions collecting clipboard data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
