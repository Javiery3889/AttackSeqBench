### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of the skip-2.0 backdoor using the SessionEnv service, achieving persistence through DLL hijacking of the TSVIPSrv.DLL file, and asks whether the skip-2.0 backdoor is likely to employ a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location that is searched before the legitimate DLL, allowing the malicious DLL to be loaded instead.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate application to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique is used to maintain persistence by ensuring that a malicious DLL is loaded each time a legitimate application is executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question already mentions that the skip-2.0 backdoor has achieved persistence through DLL hijacking of the TSVIPSrv.DLL file. This aligns with the T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking technique.
   - The question also asks whether the skip-2.0 backdoor is likely to employ a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion.
   - A VMProtected launcher is a technique used to protect the payload from analysis and detection by running it in a virtualized environment. This is a form of defense evasion but is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - The related TTPs focus on DLL hijacking and side-loading, which are specific techniques for achieving persistence and defense evasion, but they do not explicitly mention the use of a VMProtected launcher.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the related TTPs focus on DLL hijacking and side-loading, and do not mention the use of a VMProtected launcher, it is less likely that the skip-2.0 backdoor would employ a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion in this context.

**Final Answer: B: No**
