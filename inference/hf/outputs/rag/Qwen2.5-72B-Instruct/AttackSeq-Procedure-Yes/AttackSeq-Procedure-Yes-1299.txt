### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an Excel document is used to exploit CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts using T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Excel) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:**
     - This technique involves hiding files and directories to avoid detection by security tools and users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - The initial step of the attack is to exploit CVE-2017-11882 in an Excel document to execute code silently.
   - **Hidden Files and Directories (T1564.001):**
     - After gaining initial execution, it is common for attackers to hide their artifacts to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Searching for and Extracting Credentials:**
     - Once the attacker has established a foothold and hidden their artifacts, they may proceed to search for and extract credentials from the registry or stored files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The attacker uses a vulnerability in Excel to execute code.
     2. **Defense Evasion (T1564.001):** The attacker hides files and directories to avoid detection.
     3. **Credential Access:** The attacker then searches for and extracts credentials.

   - Hiding artifacts (T1564.001) is a common step in the attack chain to ensure that the attacker's presence remains undetected while they perform further actions, such as credential extraction.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
