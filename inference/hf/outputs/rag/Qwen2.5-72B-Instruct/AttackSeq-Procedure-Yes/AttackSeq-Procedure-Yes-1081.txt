### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus Group, after collecting information about users, network settings, and processes using utilities like `net user` and `tasklist.exe` for discovery, is likely to use compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement on the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:** This technique involves adversaries attempting to identify local system accounts, which can be useful for gaining initial access or for lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries attempting to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that have logged in to a system, or whether a user is actively using the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Lazarus Group has already used `net user` and `tasklist.exe` to gather information about local accounts and system processes. This aligns with the T1087.001 and T1033 techniques, which are part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After discovering local accounts and system processes, it is common for adversaries to use this information to identify potential targets for lateral movement. Compromised legitimate privileged accounts are often used for this purpose because they provide the necessary permissions to access other systems on the network.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The sequence of TTPs (Discovery followed by Lateral Movement) is a common attack pattern. After discovering the network and user information, the next logical step is to use this information to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, it is highly likely that the Lazarus Group would use compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement on the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
