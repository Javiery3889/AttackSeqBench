### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the 'Recon' module group will collect initial system information (such as browser history and cached credentials) before the 'Wnhttp' module checks Internet connectivity and obtains the external IP address of the targeted system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering system network configurations, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This sub-technique specifically involves checking for an active internet connection and obtaining the external IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial System Information Collection:**
     - Collecting initial system information, such as browser history and cached credentials, is typically part of the **Discovery** and **Credential Access** tactics. Techniques like T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) and T1012 (Query Registry) are often used for this purpose.
   - **Internet Connection Discovery:**
     - The T1016.001 sub-technique (Internet Connection Discovery) is specifically about checking for an active internet connection and obtaining the external IP address. This is a crucial step for the adversary to understand the network environment and plan further actions.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is logical for an adversary to first ensure they have an active internet connection and know the external IP address before delving into more detailed system information collection. This is because:
       - **Network Awareness:** Knowing the external IP and network configuration helps the adversary understand the network environment and plan their next steps.
       - **Resource Allocation:** Ensuring internet connectivity is often a prerequisite for exfiltrating data or communicating with command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Recon Module Group:**
     - The 'Recon' module group is likely to perform a broad range of discovery tasks, including both network configuration and system information collection. However, the sequence of these tasks can vary based on the adversary's strategy and the specific tools used.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of operations, it is more likely that the 'Wnhttp' module will check Internet connectivity and obtain the external IP address before the 'Recon' module group collects detailed system information.

### Final Answer: B: No
