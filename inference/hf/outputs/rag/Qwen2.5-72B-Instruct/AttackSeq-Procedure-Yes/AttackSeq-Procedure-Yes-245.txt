### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs:
     - A document appearing to be sent by the Cabinet of Cambodia and containing a list of government officials was created to lure victims.
     - The document exploits CVE-2018-0798 through a malicious RTF file for initial access.
     - After gaining initial access, the file 'OSEA54d.tmp' was used to drop additional malicious files into system directories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment that, when opened, provides initial access to the adversary.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs:
       - **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):** The document appearing to be sent by the Cabinet of Cambodia and containing a list of government officials is a classic example of a spearphishing attachment. The goal is to trick the victim into opening the document.
       - **Malicious File (T1204.002):** Once the document is opened, it exploits CVE-2018-0798 through a malicious RTF file to gain initial access.
       - **Execution and Dropping Malicious Files:** After gaining initial access, the file 'OSEA54d.tmp' is used to drop additional malicious files into system directories, which is a common follow-up action to establish a foothold and further compromise the system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described is not likely, which does not align with the related TTPs and the typical attack patterns.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
