### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the KopiLuwak backdoor is likely to exfiltrate files to the C2 server while also being able to download files to the infected machine after communicating with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves the exfiltration of data from a compromised system to a C2 server using the same channel that was used for command and control communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the KopiLuwak backdoor is capable of both exfiltrating files to the C2 server and downloading files to the infected machine.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the KopiLuwak backdoor is not capable of both exfiltrating files to the C2 server and downloading files to the infected machine.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) indicates that the backdoor can exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2 communication.
   - However, the question also asks about the ability to download files to the infected machine. While T1041 specifically mentions exfiltration, it is common for backdoors to have multiple capabilities, including both exfiltration and file download.
   - Given that the backdoor is communicating with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests, it is reasonable to assume that it can use the same channel for both exfiltration and file download, as these are typical functionalities of advanced backdoors.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
