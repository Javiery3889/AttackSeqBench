### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda, after using the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in a spearphishing campaign, is likely to use documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension:**
     - This technique involves using a double file extension to make a file appear benign (e.g., `sample.doc.lnk` instead of `sample.lnk`), which can help evade user and security defenses.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that, when clicked, can lead to the download of malware or the execution of a malicious payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Double File Extension (T1036.007):**
     - The use of a double file extension is a common tactic to trick users into opening malicious files. Once the file is opened, it can execute a payload or establish a connection to a C2 server.
   - **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):**
     - Spearphishing links are often used to deliver malware or to trick users into providing sensitive information. If the link leads to a malicious document, it can also be configured to connect to a C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The spearphishing campaign using the double file extension trick is designed to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Post-Initial Access:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, it is common for attackers to establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised system and to exfiltrate data or perform further actions.
   - **Mustang Panda's TTPs:**
     - Mustang Panda, like many advanced threat actors, often uses a combination of techniques to achieve their goals. After gaining initial access, they are likely to establish a C2 connection to maintain control and execute further commands.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
