### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The ransomware is deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the ransomware will then encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, which is a common tactic used by ransomware to cause disruption and demand ransom.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop:**
     - This technique involves stopping services to disrupt the normal operation of a system, which can be a precursor to encrypting data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the related TTPs. The use of PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender (T1489) is a common prelude to encrypting data (T1486). WastedLocker is known for encrypting data and demanding ransom, which fits the Impact phase described by T1486.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs. If the ransomware has already stopped services and disabled defenses, it is highly likely that the next step would be to encrypt data and demand ransom, as described by T1486.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the typical behavior of ransomware like WastedLocker, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
