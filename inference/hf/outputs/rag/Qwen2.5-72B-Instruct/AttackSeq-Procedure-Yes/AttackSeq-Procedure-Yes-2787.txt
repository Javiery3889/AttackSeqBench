### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an app, after collecting various types of data (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) and performing routines on an iOS device, will send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is typically used for communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for command and control operations.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for command and control, such as HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the app will first send the gathered information via HTTP and then upload files via FTP.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique is relevant because the app is likely to use a C2 channel for exfiltration, which could be HTTP.
       - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique is relevant because the app might use FTP for file transfer, which is a common method for exfiltrating large amounts of data.
       - **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique is relevant because HTTP is an unencrypted protocol that can be used for exfiltration.
     - **Conclusion:** The sequence of using HTTP for initial exfiltration and then FTP for file transfer is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the app will not send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This answer does not align with the related TTPs, which suggest that both HTTP and FTP can be used for exfiltration and file transfer.
     - **Conclusion:** This answer is less plausible given the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the plausibility of the sequence described in the question, the most likely answer is:
   - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
