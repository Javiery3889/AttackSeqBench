### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether RIG EK (Exploit Kit) is likely to use malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before delivering its exploits.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising:** This technique involves using malicious advertisements to distribute malware.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on malicious links, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Malvertising (T1583.008):** Malvertising is a common method used by exploit kits to distribute malware. It involves placing malicious ads on legitimate websites, which can redirect users to exploit kits.
   - **Malicious Link (T1204.001):** This technique is often used in conjunction with malvertising. Once a user clicks on a malicious ad, they are often redirected to a landing page with a malicious link.
   - **Drive-by Compromise (T1189):** This technique is the final step where the user is redirected to a compromised website that delivers the exploit.

   Given the sequence of TTPs:
   - **Malvertising (T1583.008)** is used to initially redirect users to malicious content.
   - **Malicious Link (T1204.001)** is used to trick users into clicking on the content.
   - **Drive-by Compromise (T1189)** is used to deliver the exploit.

   This sequence aligns with the question's description of RIG EK using malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before delivering its exploits.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that RIG EK is likely to use malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before delivering its exploits.

   **Final Answer: A: Yes**
