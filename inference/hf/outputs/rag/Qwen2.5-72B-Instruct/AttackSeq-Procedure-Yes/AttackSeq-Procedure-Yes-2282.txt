### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that Regin might take after discovering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and monitoring network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers.
   - The question asks if Regin is likely to crawl through the file system and gather computer information for collection before encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include file system data, system information, and other local resources.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves using automated tools or scripts to collect data from the system, which can include file system crawling and gathering system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Regin is likely to crawl through the file system and gather computer information for collection before encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.
     - The related TTPs T1005 and T1119 both support the idea of collecting data from the local system and using automated methods to gather information, which aligns with the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Regin is not likely to perform the described sequence of actions.
     - Given the related TTPs, this choice does not align well with the described sequence of actions, as both T1005 and T1119 indicate that Regin would likely engage in data collection and automated collection methods.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that Regin is likely to crawl through the file system and gather computer information for collection before encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
