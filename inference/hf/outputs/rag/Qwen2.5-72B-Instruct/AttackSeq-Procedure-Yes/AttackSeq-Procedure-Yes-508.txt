### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in the CostaRicto Campaign:
     - Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     - The use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following these steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography (RSA) to secure communication, which is consistent with the use of RSA-secured AES key exchanges mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication, which is consistent with the question's scenario of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography** indicates that the C2 communication is secured using RSA-secured AES key exchanges, which is a common practice to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** directly supports the idea that data exfiltration can occur over the same C2 channel used for communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1573.002 and T1041 indicate that the C2 channel is used for both secure communication and data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
