### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware "Infamous Chisel" is likely to perform file and directory discovery by enumerating data directories before collecting files from local systems and application directories containing communication data, after persisting by replacing the legitimate netd system binary at the path /system/bin/netd.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting data from the victim system and preparing it for exfiltration. This can include compressing, encrypting, or otherwise organizing the data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary attempting to get information about file and directory paths on a system. This can help the adversary understand the structure of the system and identify files of interest.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel is likely to perform file and directory discovery before collecting files.
     - Given the related TTPs, this aligns well with the sequence of actions described. After persisting by replacing the netd binary, the malware would likely need to discover the files and directories of interest before collecting them.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel is not likely to perform file and directory discovery before collecting files.
     - This does not align well with the related TTPs, as file and directory discovery (T1083) is a common and logical step before data collection (T1074.001).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that Infamous Chisel is likely to perform file and directory discovery before collecting files.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
