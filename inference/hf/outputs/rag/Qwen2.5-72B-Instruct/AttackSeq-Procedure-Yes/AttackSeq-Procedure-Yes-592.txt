### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports to gain initial access and trick developers into running malicious container images.
   - It then asks if it is likely that adversaries will use command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries before achieving persistence using LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003-Malicious Image**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers gain initial access by exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports and tricking developers into running malicious container images (T1204.003-Malicious Image).
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to use command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries. This is a typical next step to establish a foothold and perform further actions.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions achieving persistence using LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow (T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking). This technique is used to ensure that the attacker's code runs every time a specific program is executed, which is a form of persistence and defense evasion.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploit misconfigured Docker API ports and trick developers into running malicious container images.
     2. **Execution:** Use command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries.
     3. **Persistence:** Achieve persistence by using LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
