### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PyFlash and NetFlash are likely to use specific ports (80, 8,000, and 15,363) for encrypted communication with their C&C servers after PyFlash gathers OS-related information and sends it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - T1571 describes the use of non-standard ports for communication with C&C servers. This technique is often used to evade detection by network security systems that may be configured to monitor standard ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Ports 80, 8,000, and 15,363:**
     - Port 80 is a standard port used for HTTP traffic.
     - Port 8,000 is a non-standard port.
     - Port 15,363 is also a non-standard port.
   - **Encrypted Network Traffic:**
     - Using encrypted network traffic (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) is a common practice to protect the confidentiality and integrity of C&C communications.
   - **Non-Standard Ports:**
     - The use of non-standard ports (8,000 and 15,363) aligns with the T1571 technique, which suggests that attackers often use such ports to avoid detection.
     - Port 80, while standard, can also be used for encrypted traffic (HTTPS on port 443), but it is more likely to be monitored and scrutinized by network security systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the T1571 technique, it is more likely that the backdoors would use non-standard ports (8,000 and 15,363) for C&C communication to evade detection.
   - Port 80, while possible, is less likely to be used for this purpose due to its standard nature and higher likelihood of being monitored.

### Final Answer:
B: No
