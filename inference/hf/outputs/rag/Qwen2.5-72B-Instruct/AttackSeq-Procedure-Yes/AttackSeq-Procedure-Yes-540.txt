### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the PIVY variant:
     - It evades defenses using DLL sideloading.
     - It modifies its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.
     - Given the related TTPs:
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** directly supports the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
       - **T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation** suggests that the malware might use legitimate protocols to avoid detection, which aligns with using application layer protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate the use of web protocols and protocol impersonation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described behavior of the PIVY variant, it is likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
