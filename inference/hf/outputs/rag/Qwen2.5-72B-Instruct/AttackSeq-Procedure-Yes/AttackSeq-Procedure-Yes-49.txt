### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - The malicious Word document contains a VBS macro that retrieves an encoded PowerShell script.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Word document, which can contain a macro or other malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to download and execute additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through a phishing email with a malicious Word document, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
   - **Execution of VBS Macro:**
     - The Word document contains a VBS macro, which is a common method to execute malicious code.
   - **Retrieval and Execution of PowerShell Script:**
     - The VBS macro retrieves an encoded PowerShell script, which aligns with T1059.001-PowerShell.
   - **Download of Payloads:**
     - PowerShell scripts are often used to download and execute additional payloads, such as malware like Ursnif and GandCrab.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the common use of PowerShell for downloading and executing additional payloads, it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
