### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether recipients of spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery are likely to see a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before being infected with QuasarRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a document reader) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links that lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):** The email contains a link to a malicious RTF document. When the recipient clicks the link, they are directed to download or open the document.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The RTF document exploits CVE-2017-8750, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, to execute arbitrary code. This code is likely to download and install QuasarRAT.
   - **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):** This technique is not directly relevant to the question since the email contains a link rather than an attachment.

   - **Document Simulation:**
     - In many spear phishing campaigns, the malicious document is often designed to look legitimate to trick the user into opening it. This can include simulating a legitimate blog post or report.
     - However, the question specifically asks if the recipient is likely to see a document before being infected. Given that the exploitation occurs when the document is opened, it is reasonable to assume that the document will be presented to the user before the infection occurs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
