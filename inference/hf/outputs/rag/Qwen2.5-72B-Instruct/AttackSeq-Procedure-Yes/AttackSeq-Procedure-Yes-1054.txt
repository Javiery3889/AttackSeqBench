### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by The Darkhotel APT group.
   - They first gain victim credentials using an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - The question then asks if they are likely to deploy a keylogger module for input capture to encrypt and store gathered data in log files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also used to capture credentials by logging keystrokes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Step: Information Stealer Module**
     - The Darkhotel APT group uses an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services. This is a common initial step in many APT campaigns to gather credentials and other sensitive information.
   - **Subsequent Step: Keylogger Module**
     - After gaining initial credentials, it is common for APT groups to deploy additional tools to further compromise the target. Keylogging is a well-known technique for capturing additional sensitive information, such as passwords and other credentials, that may not be stored in browsers or email services.
   - **Purpose of Keylogging**
     - Keylogging can capture real-time input, which can include new credentials, sensitive data, and other valuable information that the information stealer module might not have access to.
   - **Encryption and Storage**
     - Encrypting and storing gathered data in log files is a common practice to ensure that the data is protected and can be exfiltrated later without being easily detected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that The Darkhotel APT would deploy a keylogger module for input capture to encrypt and store gathered data in log files after gaining initial credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
