### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the IEXPL0RE RAT, after recording keystrokes and exfiltrating data such as passwords, is likely to communicate with the C2 server using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique describes how adversaries use the same command and control (C2) channel to exfiltrate data that they use for other purposes, such as receiving commands or exfiltrating data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the IEXPL0RE RAT is likely to use encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for communication with the C2 server.
     - Given the related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), it is plausible that the RAT would use the same C2 channel for exfiltration and receiving further instructions.
     - Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are common techniques used by malware to communicate with C2 servers to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the IEXPL0RE RAT is not likely to use encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for communication with the C2 server.
     - This choice is less plausible given the related TTP, which indicates that exfiltration over the C2 channel is a common technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the common practices in malware communication, the most plausible answer is that the IEXPL0RE RAT is likely to use encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
