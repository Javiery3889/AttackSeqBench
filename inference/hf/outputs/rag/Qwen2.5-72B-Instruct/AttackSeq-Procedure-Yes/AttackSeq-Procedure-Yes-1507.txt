### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear phishing attack targeting the ASEAN region.
   - The spear phishing document is suspected to be used for reconnaissance.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components like wab.exe and wab32res.dll for achieving initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or document reader) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending a spear phishing email with an attachment that, when opened, executes malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing Attachment (T1566.001):**
     - This technique is commonly used to deliver malicious documents via email. The document is designed to trick the recipient into opening it, which then triggers the execution of malicious code.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - This technique is often used in conjunction with spear phishing to exploit vulnerabilities in client applications. For example, a malicious document might exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to execute code.
   - **CVE-2012-0158:**
     - CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability has been widely used in spear phishing attacks to drop and execute malicious components.
   - **Malicious Components (wab.exe and wab32res.dll):**
     - These are known malicious components that can be dropped by an exploit to achieve initial access. They are often used in conjunction with CVE-2012-0158 to gain a foothold on the target system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the spear phishing attack and the use of a decoy document for reconnaissance, it is highly plausible that the document would exploit a known vulnerability like CVE-2012-0158 to drop and execute malicious components such as wab.exe and wab32res.dll.
   - The combination of T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) aligns well with the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
