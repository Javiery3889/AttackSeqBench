### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the StellarParticle campaign is likely to steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after using credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence, and then use these cookies to access cloud resources.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves using web session cookies to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to gain access to web applications or services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Hopping:**
     - Credential hopping involves using compromised credentials to move from one system to another within a network.
   - **WMI Persistence:**
     - Configuring malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence ensures that the malware remains active and can be reactivated after system reboots.
   - **Stealing Web Session Cookies:**
     - Stealing web session cookies is a common technique used to gain unauthorized access to web applications or services.
   - **Using Web Session Cookies for Credential Access:**
     - Once the cookies are stolen, they can be used to access cloud resources without needing to re-authenticate, which is a form of credential access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - After gaining initial access and moving laterally using credential hopping, the attackers can configure malware for persistence.
     - Once the malware is persistent, the attackers can then focus on stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations.
     - These stolen cookies can then be used to access cloud resources, which is a common follow-up action in many campaigns to maintain access and exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
