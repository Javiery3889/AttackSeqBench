### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group is likely to encrypt network traffic with AES or a custom algorithm for secure communication with its C&C server after the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography, which is part of the Command and Control tactic. This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like AES) to encrypt network traffic to protect the confidentiality of the data being exfiltrated or commands being sent to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Sednit group is likely to use AES or a custom algorithm for encrypting network traffic.
     - Given the related TTP T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography, it is plausible that the Sednit group would use symmetric cryptography, such as AES, to encrypt network traffic. This is a common practice to ensure secure communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Sednit group is not likely to use AES or a custom algorithm for encrypting network traffic.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP, as symmetric cryptography is a standard method for securing communications in the Command and Control phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the common practices in the cybersecurity field, the most plausible answer is that the Sednit group is likely to use AES or a custom algorithm for encrypting network traffic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
