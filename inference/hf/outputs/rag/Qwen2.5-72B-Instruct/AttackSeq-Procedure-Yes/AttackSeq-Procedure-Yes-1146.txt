### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the GroundPeony campaign uses DLL side-loading with "version.dll" to decode and launch shellcode from "mic.doc".
   - It then asks whether the campaign is likely to establish C&C communication through a server identified as "app.onedrivo.com".

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a communication channel with a C&C server to send and receive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** The question mentions that the campaign uses DLL side-loading to decode and launch shellcode. This is a common technique for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **C&C Communication (T1102.002):** After gaining a foothold and evading defenses, the next logical step for an attacker is to establish C&C communication to control the compromised system and exfiltrate data.
   - **Server Identification:** The question specifies that the C&C server is identified as "app.onedrivo.com". This is a plausible domain name, as attackers often use legitimate-looking domain names to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the GroundPeony campaign would establish C&C communication through a server identified as "app.onedrivo.com" after using DLL side-loading to decode and launch shellcode.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
