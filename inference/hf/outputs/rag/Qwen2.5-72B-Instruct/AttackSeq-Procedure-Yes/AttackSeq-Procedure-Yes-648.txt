### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs after the Comfoo RAT has collected system and network information.
   - The sequence involves the C2 server hosting a rendezvous-type traffic relay program, the relay server listening on multiple TCP ports, and using encrypted HTTP requests for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This sub-technique involves the use of web protocols (such as HTTP) for command and control.
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This sub-technique involves the use of an internal proxy to route traffic within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique aligns with the idea of a rendezvous-type traffic relay program, which is a form of proxy.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This sub-technique supports the use of encrypted HTTP requests for command and control.
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This sub-technique further supports the idea of a relay server listening on multiple TCP ports to route traffic internally.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs strongly support the sequence described in the question. The use of a rendezvous-type traffic relay program, listening on multiple TCP ports, and using encrypted HTTP requests for command and control are all consistent with the techniques and sub-techniques listed.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Comfoo C2 server will host a rendezvous-type traffic relay program and the relay server will listen on multiple TCP ports for executing proxy-related tasks to establish command and control using encrypted HTTP requests.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
