### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls before a macro downloads malicious payloads from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure, after gaining initial access through malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a document, which can execute code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments, such as malicious documents, to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):** The threat actor gains initial access by sending phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.
   - **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File):** Once the victim opens the malicious document, a macro or other executable code is triggered.
   - **Disabling Security Controls:** While it is possible for threat actors to instruct victims to disable security controls, this is less common and more risky. Typically, threat actors use techniques to bypass security controls without requiring the victim to manually disable them. For example, they might use obfuscation, exploit vulnerabilities, or leverage trusted processes to execute their payloads.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the related TTPs, the most common and effective method for threat actors is to use the malicious file to execute code directly, often through macros or other embedded scripts, without explicitly instructing the victim to disable security controls. This approach is more stealthy and less likely to raise suspicion.

### Final Answer: B: No
