### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker exploits a VBScript engine vulnerability to gain initial access through a watering hole attack.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attackers would impair defenses by making the first stage downloader exit if antivirus software processes are detected before downloading and executing a backdoor for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This technique involves the attacker identifying security software and tools that are installed on a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves the attacker using vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves the attacker using a watering hole attack to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** The attacker gains initial access through a watering hole attack by exploiting a VBScript engine vulnerability.
   - **Discovery (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery):** After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely want to know what security software is present on the system to avoid detection.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion):** The attacker would use techniques to avoid being detected by the security software. One common method is to check for the presence of antivirus software and exit the first stage downloader if such software is detected.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - It is common for attackers to include checks for security software in their initial stages of an attack to avoid detection and ensure the success of their operations.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs, particularly the discovery of security software and the use of defense evasion techniques.
