### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the CosmicDuke malware:
     - Using document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening malicious PDF files.
     - Executing the malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
     - Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
     - Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of collected data to a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):**
     - The question mentions keylogging as one of the collection methods, which aligns with the related TTP.
   - **Exfiltration (T1020):**
     - The question also mentions exfiltration via FTP and WebDav, which aligns with the related TTP for automated exfiltration.
   - **Other Collection Methods:**
     - The question mentions screenshotting and clipboard stealing, which are common collection techniques used by malware like CosmicDuke, even though they are not explicitly listed in the related TTPs.
   - **Communication with Remote Servers:**
     - The question states that the malware communicates with remote servers via FTP and WebDav, which is a common method for exfiltration and updating.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware like CosmicDuke, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke is likely to perform the described sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
