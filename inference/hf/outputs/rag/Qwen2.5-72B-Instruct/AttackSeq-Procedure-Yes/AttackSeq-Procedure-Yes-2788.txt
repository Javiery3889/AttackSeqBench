### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The app executes itself in the background, hides its icon, and restarts when terminated.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the data to its C&C server via HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data to a C&C server over a command and control channel.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which can include various types of data such as geo-location.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before exfiltrating it.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the app would collect system information, including geo-location data, as part of its discovery routine.
     - The T1082 technique (System Information Discovery) supports the idea that the app would gather various types of data, including geo-location.
     - The T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) supports the idea that the collected data would be sent to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the app will not collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.
     - This choice is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that the app would gather system information and exfiltrate it.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described behavior of the XAgent app, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending it to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
