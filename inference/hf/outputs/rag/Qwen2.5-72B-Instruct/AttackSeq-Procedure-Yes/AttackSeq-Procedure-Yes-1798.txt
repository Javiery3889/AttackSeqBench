### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org` during command and control (C2) communication after using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain C2. This can include initial communication to a known domain and subsequent communication to other domains.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):** This technique is used to deploy a malicious DLL and establish persistence and evasion. It does not inherently involve C2 communication.
   - **Multi-Stage Channels (T1104):** This technique involves multiple stages of communication, which can include connecting to an initial domain and then to other domains. This is relevant to the question of whether the malware will connect back to a specific domain for C2.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of DLL side-loading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion does not necessarily mean that the malware will connect back to a specific domain for C2. However, the presence of the Multi-Stage Channels technique (T1104) suggests that the malware might use multiple stages of communication, which could include connecting to the domain `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org`.
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the malware could connect back to the specified domain as part of its C2 communication.
