### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Longhorn group:
     - Initial access is gained by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document.
     - The target is infected with Plexor malware.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the tools used by Longhorn will follow guidelines from the Vault 7 documents to avoid detection before performing detailed system fingerprinting.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, a Word document) to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory structures on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution), which aligns with the question's description of exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document.
   - **Avoiding Detection:**
     - The question mentions following guidelines from the Vault 7 documents to avoid detection. The Vault 7 documents are a collection of CIA hacking tools and techniques, which often include methods to avoid detection.
   - **System Fingerprinting:**
     - The question also mentions performing detailed system fingerprinting, which aligns with the T1082 (System Information Discovery) and T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) techniques.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of Following Vault 7 Guidelines:**
     - Advanced threat actors like Longhorn are known to use sophisticated techniques to avoid detection. The Vault 7 documents provide valuable insights into such techniques.
     - It is plausible that Longhorn would follow these guidelines to ensure their operations remain undetected.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (initial access, avoiding detection, and then system fingerprinting) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks.
     - After gaining initial access, it is crucial for the attacker to avoid detection before performing further actions like system fingerprinting.
