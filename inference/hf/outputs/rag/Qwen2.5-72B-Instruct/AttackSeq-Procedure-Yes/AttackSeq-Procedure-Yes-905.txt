### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dexphot, after using process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes, is likely to use fileless techniques for defense evasion to prevent detection and obfuscate its activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This indicates that process hollowing is used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, which is a common technique for evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This suggests that process hollowing can also be used to escalate privileges, which is another aspect of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Hollowing (T1055.012):** This technique involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming the process. This is a fileless technique because the malicious code is not written to the disk, making it harder to detect.
   - **Fileless Techniques:** Fileless techniques are methods that do not rely on writing files to the disk, which helps in evading detection by traditional file-based security solutions.
   - **Dexphot:** Dexphot is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, including the use of fileless methods to avoid detection. Given that it already uses process hollowing, which is a fileless technique, it is highly likely that Dexphot would continue to use fileless techniques for further defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that Dexphot is likely to use fileless techniques for defense evasion after employing process hollowing.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
