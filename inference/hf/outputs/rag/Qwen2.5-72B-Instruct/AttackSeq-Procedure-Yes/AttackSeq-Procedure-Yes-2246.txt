### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy, after deploying modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging during the collection phase, is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also used for credential access by capturing keystrokes to obtain credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question mentions that SideCopy has already deployed modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging during the collection phase. This aligns with the related TTPs T1056.001 (Keylogging) and T1555.003 (Credentials from Web Browsers).
   - **Credential Access Tactic:**
     - The question then asks if SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.
     - The related TTPs T1056.001 (Keylogging) and T1555.003 (Credentials from Web Browsers) are both relevant to credential access, but they do not specifically mention Kavach or GoLang-based file recon plugins.
     - However, the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate authentication databases is a plausible next step in the credential access phase, especially if Kavach is a target of interest.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the related TTPs support the use of keylogging and browser password stealing for credential access, and considering that exfiltrating authentication databases is a common next step in credential access, the most plausible answer is that SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
