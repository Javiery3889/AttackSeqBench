### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke, after targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, is likely to search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts using the technique described under Data from Removable Media (T1025).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves adversaries collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering peripheral devices connected to a system, which can include removable media.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.
     - Given the related TTPs, T1025 (Data from Removable Media) is directly relevant to the collection of data from removable media. If CosmicDuke is already targeting files on hard drives and network drives, it is plausible that it would also target removable drives to maximize its data collection efforts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to search removable drives for files.
     - This choice is less plausible given the presence of T1025 in the related TTPs, which specifically describes the collection of data from removable media.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of an attacker's actions, it is more plausible that CosmicDuke would search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
