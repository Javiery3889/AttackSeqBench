### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the malware 'Surtr':
     - 'Surtr' discovers file directories and contents on the victim's system.
     - 'Surtr' creates folders for storing temporary information such as file listings and keylogger output.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that 'Surtr' will connect to a command and control (C2) server and download a stage two component to a specific directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves the malware staging data locally on the victim's system before exfiltration. This aligns with the creation of folders for storing temporary information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083 - File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware discovering file and directory information on the victim's system. This aligns with the initial discovery of file directories and contents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs confirm that 'Surtr' is performing discovery and local data staging, which are typical initial steps in a multi-stage attack.
   - After discovering and staging data, it is common for malware to connect to a C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional components.
   - The sequence described in the question (discovery, local data staging, and then connecting to a C2 server) is a logical and common progression in malware operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a multi-stage attack, it is likely that 'Surtr' will connect to a C2 server and download a stage two component to a specific directory.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
