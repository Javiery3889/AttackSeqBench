### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Milum Trojan, after ensuring persistence using HKCU autorun system registry keys (Run and RunOnce), is likely to use JSON configuration data and transmit C2 communications via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP) for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves using registry run keys to ensure that a program runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):**
     - The Milum Trojan is using HKCU autorun system registry keys (Run and RunOnce) to ensure persistence. This aligns with the T1547.001 technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):**
     - The question asks if the Milum Trojan is likely to use JSON configuration data and transmit C2 communications via HTTP POST requests. This aligns with the T1071.001 technique, which involves using web protocols for C2 communications.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The Milum Trojan has already established persistence using registry run keys. It is common for malware to use web protocols (HTTP) for C2 communications, and JSON is a common format for configuration data in such communications.
   - Given the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the Milum Trojan will use JSON configuration data and transmit C2 communications via HTTP POST requests.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
