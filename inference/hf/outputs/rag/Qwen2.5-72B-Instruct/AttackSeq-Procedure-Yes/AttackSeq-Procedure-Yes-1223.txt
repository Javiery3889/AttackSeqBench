### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
   - The actions include using Mimikatz for credential theft, accessing a Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus, and copying the NTDS.DIT database file.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibit logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves using tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials from the NTDS.DIT file, which is the database that stores user account information in Active Directory.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain initial access to a network. APT groups often use stolen credentials to log in as valid users to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Mimikatz for Credential Theft:** APT10 is known to use Mimikatz to steal credentials, which aligns with the T1003.003 technique.
   - **Accessing the Domain Controller and Deploying Trochilus:** Accessing the domain controller and deploying malware like Trochilus is a common tactic for APT groups to gain deeper access and maintain persistence.
   - **Copying the NTDS.DIT Database File:** This is a direct application of the T1003.003 technique, allowing the attackers to extract all user credentials from the domain.
   - **Logging in via Citrix Servers Using Valid Accounts:** APT10 is known to use stolen credentials to log in to network resources, which aligns with the T1078 technique.
   - **Exhibiting Logins Consistent with Tianjin, China Working Hours:** APT10 is believed to be based in China, and it is common for APT groups to conduct operations during their local working hours to blend in with normal user activity and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the alignment with known APT10 TTPs, it is highly likely that APT10 will log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibit logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
