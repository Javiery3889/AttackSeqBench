### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to conduct discovery activities, specifically system service discovery, before using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement after gaining credential access using the Responder tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering system services to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The Lazarus group has already gained credential access using the Responder tool.
   - **Discovery:** After gaining credentials, it is common for adversaries to conduct discovery activities to understand the network environment and identify potential targets. System service discovery (T1007) is a typical discovery technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Once the adversary has a better understanding of the environment, they are likely to use lateral movement techniques to spread to other systems. SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002) and WMIC (T1047) are common methods for lateral movement.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (credential access, discovery, lateral movement) is a logical and common attack pattern. After gaining credentials, adversaries often perform discovery to gather information before moving laterally to other systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
