### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a loader gathers detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries. This is followed by a backdoor that collects a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - T1082-System Information Discovery involves adversaries gathering information about the system and its configuration, which aligns with the initial step of the loader gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the initial information gathering, the backdoor will indeed collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced malware, where initial reconnaissance (discovery) is followed by more extensive data collection and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
     - This is less likely because once an adversary has gathered initial system information, they often proceed to collect more detailed data to further their objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the typical behavior of malware, the most plausible sequence is that the backdoor will indeed collect a wide range of data from the victim's system after the initial information gathering.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
