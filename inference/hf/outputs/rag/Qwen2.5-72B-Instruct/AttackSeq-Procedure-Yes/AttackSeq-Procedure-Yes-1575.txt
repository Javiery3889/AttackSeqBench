### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla's RPC backdoor is likely to perform lateral movement to facilitate file and directory discovery before using plugins to gather file and directory information, after leveraging persistence methods like modifying the PowerShell profile.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts on remote systems, which is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to gather information about the target environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Modifying PowerShell Profile):** Turla's use of modifying the PowerShell profile to load scripts on startup is a method to ensure that their malware persists on the system. This is a common initial step to maintain access.
   - **Lateral Movement (WMI):** After gaining persistence, it is logical for an advanced threat actor like Turla to perform lateral movement to spread to other systems within the network. WMI is a powerful tool for this purpose.
   - **File and Directory Discovery (T1083):** Once the adversary has moved laterally, they would likely perform file and directory discovery to understand the environment and identify valuable files and directories. This is a crucial step before gathering specific information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, it is highly likely that Turla's RPC backdoor will perform lateral movement using WMI to facilitate file and directory discovery before utilizing plugins to gather file and directory information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
