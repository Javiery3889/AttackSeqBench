### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Emissary Trojan authors will update the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE header hashes after achieving persistence through registry key manipulation and hijacking legitimate services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the registry to change the behavior of the system, often to maintain persistence or evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process:** This technique involves modifying the authentication process to maintain access to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Registry Modification:**
     - The Emissary Trojan has already achieved persistence by creating registry keys and hijacking legitimate services. This is a common tactic to ensure the malware remains on the system even after a reboot.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Modifying the registry (T1112) is a form of defense evasion, but it is more about maintaining persistence and control over the system.
   - **PE Header Hashes:**
     - Recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes would not effectively evade detection. Security tools often use a combination of static and dynamic analysis to detect malware. Static analysis includes checking the PE header, but dynamic analysis involves monitoring the behavior of the malware.
     - If the PE header hashes remain the same, it is likely that security tools will still flag the malware as suspicious, especially if the behavior remains the same.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - To effectively evade detection, malware authors typically change the PE header, use packers or crypters, or employ other obfuscation techniques. Simply recompiling the code without changing the PE header is not a robust evasion strategy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the analysis, it is unlikely that Emissary Trojan authors would update the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE header hashes. This approach would not provide significant benefits in terms of evading detection.

**Final Answer: B: No**
