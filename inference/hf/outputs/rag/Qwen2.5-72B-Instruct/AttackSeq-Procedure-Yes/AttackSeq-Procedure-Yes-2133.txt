### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Konni APT Group is likely to send collected data through `unactivate.vbs` before exfiltrating it via a POST request.
   - The collected data is obtained using `versioninfo.bat`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic:** Exfiltration
     - **Technique:** T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
   - This TTP indicates that the data is exfiltrated over a command and control (C2) channel, which is typically done using network protocols like HTTP/HTTPS (POST requests).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the data is sent through `unactivate.vbs` before being exfiltrated via a POST request.
     - `unactivate.vbs` is a script that could be used to process or format the data before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the data is exfiltrated directly via a POST request without being processed through `unactivate.vbs`.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) does not specify the use of an intermediate script like `unactivate.vbs`. It generally refers to the direct exfiltration of data over a network channel.
   - However, it is common for APT groups to use scripts to process or format data before exfiltration to avoid detection or to ensure the data is in a usable format for the C2 server.
   - Given that `unactivate.vbs` is mentioned, it is plausible that the Konni APT Group uses this script to process the data before exfiltration.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the context and the common practices of APT groups, it is more likely that the data is processed through `unactivate.vbs` before being exfiltrated via a POST request.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
