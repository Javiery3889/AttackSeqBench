### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether QuasarRAT, after using obfuscation and encryption techniques like CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx, is likely to communicate with a C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves the use of obfuscation and encryption to hide the true nature of files, commands, or network traffic to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation and Encryption:**
     - The question mentions the use of CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx, which are tools used to obfuscate and encrypt the malware to avoid detection.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The question also asks about the likelihood of using AES-128 encryption for C2 communication.
   - **QuasarRAT Characteristics:**
     - QuasarRAT is known for its ability to use various obfuscation and encryption techniques to evade detection. It often includes features to secure its C2 communication to avoid interception and analysis.
   - **AES-128 Encryption:**
     - AES-128 is a strong encryption standard that is commonly used in C2 communication to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that QuasarRAT is designed to evade detection and secure its communication, it is highly likely that it would use strong encryption like AES-128 for C2 communication. The use of obfuscation and encryption techniques like CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx aligns with the overall strategy of evading detection and securing communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
