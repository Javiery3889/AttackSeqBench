### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Bisonal malware, after using the RC4 cipher with a specific key for encrypting C2 address strings in the defense evasion phase, is likely to use HTTP POST requests encrypted with the RC4 cipher in the command and control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (e.g., RC4) to encrypt C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Bisonal malware will use HTTP POST requests encrypted with the RC4 cipher in the command and control phase.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The related TTPs indicate that Bisonal malware uses web protocols (HTTP) for C2 communication (T1071.001).
       - The related TTPs also indicate that Bisonal malware uses symmetric cryptography (RC4) for encrypting C2 communications (T1573.001).
       - Given that the malware already uses RC4 for encrypting C2 address strings in the defense evasion phase, it is plausible that it would continue to use the same encryption method for C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Bisonal malware will not use HTTP POST requests encrypted with the RC4 cipher in the command and control phase.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice contradicts the related TTPs, which indicate the use of both web protocols and symmetric cryptography (RC4) for C2 communications.
       - It is less likely that the malware would switch to a different encryption method or protocol for C2 communications if it has already established a pattern of using RC4.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical consistency of the malware's behavior, the most plausible answer is that Bisonal malware will use HTTP POST requests encrypted with the RC4 cipher in the command and control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
