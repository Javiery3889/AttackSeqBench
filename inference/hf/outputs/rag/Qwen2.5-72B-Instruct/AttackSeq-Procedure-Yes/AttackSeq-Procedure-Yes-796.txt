### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform specific actions after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying shortcuts to ensure that malicious code is executed when the user interacts with the shortcut.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves using JavaScript to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Malicious Link (T1204.001):** This technique aligns with the initial step of distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. The LNK files can contain a malicious link that, when clicked, triggers the execution of a JavaScript file.
   - **Shortcut Modification (T1547.009):** This technique can be used to ensure that the malicious JavaScript file or the resulting executable (e.g., 'd3reEW.exe') is executed persistently, such as by copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
   - **JavaScript Execution (T1059.007):** This technique directly supports the execution of the JavaScript file, which can perform actions like creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is highly plausible that the Higaisa APT group will use a JavaScript file to perform the described actions after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. The sequence of TTPs (malicious link, shortcut modification, and JavaScript execution) aligns well with the described attack scenario.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
