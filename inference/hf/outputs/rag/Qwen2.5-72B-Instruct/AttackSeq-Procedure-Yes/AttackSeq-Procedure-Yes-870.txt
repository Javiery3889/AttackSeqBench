### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether GreyEnergy, after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers, is likely to implement stealth techniques such as pushing selected modules to selected targets, partially encrypting these modules using AES-256, and running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that GreyEnergy uses spearphishing emails and compromises public-facing web servers to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1190 technique, which involves exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The question also mentions that GreyEnergy is likely to implement stealth techniques, including:
       - Pushing selected modules to selected targets.
       - Partially encrypting these modules using AES-256.
       - Running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.
     - The T1027.013 technique, which involves encrypting or encoding files, aligns with the encryption and encoding of modules to avoid detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs support the idea that GreyEnergy would use stealth techniques to evade detection. The use of encryption and fileless execution are common tactics in the T1027.013 technique, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
