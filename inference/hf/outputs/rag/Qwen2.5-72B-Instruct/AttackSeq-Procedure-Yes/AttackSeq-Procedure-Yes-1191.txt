### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker:
     - Adds a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows registry Run key to achieve persistence.
     - Uses the RMS executable to evade detection during reconnaissance and lateral movement.
     - Attempts to connect to a C2 server located in Germany.
     - Utilizes the ServHelper backdoor during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:**
     - This technique involves modifying the registry to evade detection or maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves adding a registry key to ensure that a program runs at logon.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up programs to run automatically when the system boots or a user logs on.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions adding a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows registry Run key, which aligns with T1547.001 and T1547.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of the RMS executable to evade detection during reconnaissance and lateral movement aligns with T1112, as modifying the registry can help evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The question asks if the RMS executable will attempt to connect to a C2 server in Germany and if TA505 will use the ServHelper backdoor.
     - TA505 is known to use various backdoors, including ServHelper, for command and control.
     - Connecting to a C2 server in Germany is a plausible action for a sophisticated threat actor like TA505.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described TTPs with known techniques and the behavior of TA505, it is likely that the RMS executable will attempt to connect to a C2 server in Germany and that TA505 will utilize the ServHelper backdoor during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
