### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers gain initial access to hosts using tools like Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC. These tools are used for scanning and remote control.
   - After gaining access, the question asks if it is likely that attackers will use AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves the use of tools to support the adversary's operations, which aligns with the use of Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves the use of remote access tools to control systems, which aligns with the use of Radmin and PushVNC.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves the creation of local accounts to maintain access, which aligns with the creation of new local accounts mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access**: The use of Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC to gain initial access and create new local accounts is well-supported by the related TTPs (T1588.002 and T1219).
   - **Defense Evasion**: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events. This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, specifically the technique T1078.003 (Local Accounts) and other techniques like T1027 (Obfuscation) and T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host), which are not explicitly listed but are common in such scenarios.
   - **Plausibility**: It is common for attackers to use batch files (like AutoExe1.bat) to automate the process of downloading malware and clearing system events to evade detection. This is a typical next step after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns and the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
