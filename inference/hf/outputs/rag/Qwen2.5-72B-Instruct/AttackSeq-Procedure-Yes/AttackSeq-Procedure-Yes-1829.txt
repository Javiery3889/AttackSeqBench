### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the callCam app, after evading detection through overlay screens, will collect files and screenshots from compromised devices, encrypt this data using RSA and AES, and then exfiltrate it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make it harder to detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection of Files and Screenshots:**
     - The T1560 technique (Archive Collected Data) suggests that the app will collect and compress data, which aligns with the collection of files and screenshots.
   - **Encryption of Data:**
     - The T1027.013 technique (Encrypted/Encoded File) and T1027 technique (Obfuscated Files or Information) both indicate that the app will encrypt or obfuscate the collected data to evade detection.
   - **Exfiltration to C&C Server:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, the combination of collection and encryption techniques strongly suggests that the data will be exfiltrated to a C&C server, as this is a common next step in the attack chain.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, it is likely that the callCam app will collect files and screenshots, encrypt this data using RSA and AES, and exfiltrate it to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
