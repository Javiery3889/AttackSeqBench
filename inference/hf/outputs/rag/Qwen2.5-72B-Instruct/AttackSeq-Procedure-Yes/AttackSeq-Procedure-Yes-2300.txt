### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversary accessed the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying, then installed a Cobalt Strike beacon using a PowerShell one-liner, and finally leveraged scheduled tasks to execute a batch file for their tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. It is commonly used for initial access and for installing malware like Cobalt Strike beacons.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute commands or scripts at specific times. It is often used to maintain persistence and to ensure that malicious activities are carried out regularly.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions accessing the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying. This is a common initial access technique, but it is not explicitly listed in the related TTPs. However, it is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - **Installation of Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - The use of a PowerShell one-liner to install the Cobalt Strike beacon aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique. This is a common method for executing initial payloads.
   - **Leveraging Scheduled Tasks:**
     - The use of scheduled tasks to execute a batch file aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and ensuring that the beacon or other malicious activities are executed regularly.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The initial access method (password spraying) is a common technique, and the subsequent steps (PowerShell one-liner and scheduled tasks) are well-documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
