### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Powersing, after capturing periodic screenshots and executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C server, is likely to leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves adversaries using legitimate protocols or services to blend their malicious traffic with legitimate traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves adversaries using dead drop resolvers to store data in publicly accessible locations, which can be used to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves adversaries using PowerShell to execute arbitrary scripts, which can be used for various malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Powersing captures periodic screenshots and executes arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C server. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that Powersing would leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers to store data and blend communication into legitimate traffic.
     - **T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation** suggests that the adversary might use legitimate protocols or services to blend their traffic.
     - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** indicates that the adversary might use publicly accessible locations to store data, which aligns with the idea of blending communication into legitimate traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Powersing would not use public services or dead drop resolvers. However, given the related TTPs, this seems less likely because these techniques are commonly used to evade detection and maintain communication with the C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Powersing would leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
