### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary, after identifying privileged users using the PsLogList tool during the discovery phase, would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email messages from mail servers, clients, and other sources.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves determining the system time and time zone of a system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This sub-technique involves collecting email messages from the local system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The adversary uses the PsLogList tool to identify privileged users. This is part of the discovery phase, where the adversary gathers information about the target environment.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - After identifying privileged users, the adversary is likely to move to the collection phase to gather sensitive information.
     - The related TTPs indicate that email collection (T1114) is a common technique used in the collection phase.
     - Specifically, T1114.001 (Local Email Collection) suggests that the adversary would collect email messages from the local system.
   - **Remote Email Collection:**
     - While T1114.001 focuses on local email collection, the broader T1114 technique can also involve collecting email messages from remote systems. This is a logical next step after collecting local emails, especially if the adversary has identified privileged users who may have access to remote systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
