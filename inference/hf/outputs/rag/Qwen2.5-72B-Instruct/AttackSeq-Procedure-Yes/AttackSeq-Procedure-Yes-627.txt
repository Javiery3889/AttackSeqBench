### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the delivery and execution of malware.
   - The malware is delivered via a compressed file ('Thu moi.7z') containing a malicious HTA file ('Thumoi.hta').
   - The HTA file contains a VB Script that drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word file.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is consistent with the delivery of the malware via 'Thu moi.7z' and 'Thumoi.hta'.
   - **T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute code, which aligns with the execution of the VB Script in the HTA file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Delivery and Execution:**
     - The malware is delivered via a compressed file and an HTA file, which is a common method for delivering malware.
     - The HTA file contains a VB Script, which is used to execute the malicious payload.
   - **Decoy File:**
     - The VB Script drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word file to make the user believe they are opening a legitimate document.
   - **Rewriting and Execution:**
     - After the initial execution, it is common for malware to rewrite itself to avoid detection and to ensure persistence.
     - Rewriting the malware to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension is a technique used to evade detection by security software.
     - Creating a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file is a common next step to ensure the malware runs and maintains its presence on the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common practices in malware execution and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
