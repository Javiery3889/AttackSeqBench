### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SLUB malware, after collecting system information and capturing screenshots during the Discovery phase, is likely to exfiltrate this data via the same Mattermost server in the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. This is a common practice in malware to maintain stealth and efficiency.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will exfiltrate the collected data via the same Mattermost server.
     - Given the related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), it is highly plausible that the malware would use the same Mattermost server for exfiltration. This is because the Mattermost server is already being used for communication and interaction, making it a logical and efficient choice for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not exfiltrate the data via the same Mattermost server.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP, as it would be less efficient and more complex for the malware to use a different channel for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will exfiltrate the collected data via the same Mattermost server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
