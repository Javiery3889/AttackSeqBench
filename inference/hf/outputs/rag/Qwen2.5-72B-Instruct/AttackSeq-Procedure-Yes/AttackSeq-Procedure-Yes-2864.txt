### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a modified CCleaner binary executes malicious code, decrypts a multi-stage payload, and then potentially establishes a Command and Control (C2) channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. HTTPS is often used to encrypt the communication, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain a C2 channel. This can include initial contact, followed by more complex and secure communication methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would indeed establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The use of HTTPS (T1071.001) aligns with the need to encrypt and encode system information to avoid detection.
       - The multi-stage nature of the payload (T1104) suggests that the malware would likely use a secure and multi-layered approach to establish and maintain the C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which strongly suggest the use of web protocols and multi-stage communication for C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the malware would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
