### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that RIG EK (Exploit Kit) will use proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and then return encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to encrypt command and control communications to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Proxy Servers:**
     - Using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect is a common tactic in malware and exploit kits. Proxy servers can help obfuscate the origin of the traffic and make it more difficult for network defenders to trace the source of the infection.
   - **Encrypted Exploit Code:**
     - Encrypting exploit code is another common tactic to avoid detection by security software. This can include using symmetric encryption algorithms like RC4.
   - **Custom Version of RC4:**
     - Using a custom version of RC4 is plausible because attackers often modify existing algorithms to evade signature-based detection. RC4 is a well-known symmetric encryption algorithm that has been used in various malware and exploit kits.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
     - Establishing an encrypted channel for C2 operations is a standard practice to maintain stealth and control over the infected systems. The use of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) aligns with this practice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common practices in malware and exploit kits, it is likely that RIG EK would use proxy servers and return encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for C2 operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
