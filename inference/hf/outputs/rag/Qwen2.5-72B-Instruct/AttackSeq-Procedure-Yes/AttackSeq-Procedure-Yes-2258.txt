### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Cosmic Banker group uses a phishing email to deliver a malicious attachment (COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat) and gain initial access.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file will execute a PowerShell script before establishing persistence through shortcuts in the startup folder and scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves adversaries creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute their tools or malware at a specified time or in response to certain events.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique is also listed under the Execution tactic, indicating that scheduled tasks can be used to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department, which delivers a malicious attachment (COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat).
   - **Execution of PowerShell Script:** It is common for batch files (like COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat) to execute PowerShell scripts to perform various malicious activities, such as downloading additional payloads or establishing persistence.
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**
     - **Shortcuts in the Startup Folder:** This is a common method to ensure that the malware runs every time the user logs in.
     - **Scheduled Tasks:** This is another method to ensure that the malware runs at specific intervals or in response to certain events.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the nature of the attack, it is highly likely that the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file will execute a PowerShell script to perform additional actions, such as downloading more malware or setting up persistence mechanisms.
   - The related TTPs (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) indicate that scheduled tasks are used for both persistence and execution, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - The sequence of events (phishing email -> malicious attachment -> PowerShell script execution -> persistence) is a common and logical progression in many cyber attacks.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
