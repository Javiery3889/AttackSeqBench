### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers are likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the relevant data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions:**
     - This technique involves installing or modifying kernel modules or extensions to maintain persistence. This is a method to ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the system even after a reboot.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a step in the data exfiltration process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the relevant data.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Installing persistence points (T1547.006) is a common tactic to ensure long-term access to the system. This is often done during the initial stages of the attack, including during lateral movement, to maintain control over the compromised systems.
       - Once the attackers have established persistence, they can then proceed to collect the relevant data (T1005) without the risk of losing access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that attackers will not install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the relevant data.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This would imply that the attackers are more focused on quickly collecting data without ensuring long-term access. While this can happen in some scenarios, it is less common because maintaining persistence is crucial for a successful and sustained attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical attack sequence, it is more plausible that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the relevant data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
