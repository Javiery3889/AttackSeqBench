### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication for command and control operations after discovering system information and process lists using the `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` command.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering running processes on the system, which is consistent with the use of the `tasklist` command.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of web protocols, specifically HTTPS, for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Discovery (T1057):** The malware has already performed process discovery using the `tasklist` command, which is a common initial step in understanding the environment it is operating in.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):** After gathering system information and process lists, it is common for malware to establish a command and control channel to communicate with the attacker. HTTPS is a popular choice for C2 communications because it is encrypted and can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common sequence of actions in malware operations, it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS for command and control operations after discovering system information and process lists.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
