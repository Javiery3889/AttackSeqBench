### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether "Machete" is likely to capture audio from the computer's microphone and copy files to a special USB device during the collection phase after establishing persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1123-Audio Capture:** This technique involves capturing audio from the computer's microphone.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The question mentions that "Machete" has already established persistence by creating tasks and placing malicious files in specific directories. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to ensure the malware remains active on the system.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The collection phase is a subsequent step where the attacker gathers data from the compromised system.
   - **Audio Capture (T1123):**
     - This technique is relevant to the question as it involves capturing audio from the computer's microphone, which is one of the activities mentioned.
   - **Data from Removable Media (T1025):**
     - This technique is also relevant as it involves copying files to a special USB device, which is another activity mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Both T1123 (Audio Capture) and T1025 (Data from Removable Media) are techniques that fall under the Collection tactic. Given that "Machete" has already established persistence, it is plausible that the malware would proceed to collect data using these techniques.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
