### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Hidden Cobra, after using the Bankshot malware for reconnaissance, would distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves the acquisition of domains to support future operations.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves the registration of domains to support future operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Hidden Cobra used the Bankshot malware to collect information on victim organizations. This is a typical reconnaissance activity where the attackers gather data to plan their next steps.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The resource development phase involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and resources for the attack. This includes acquiring or registering domains that can be used to distribute malware or conduct other malicious activities.
   - **Malicious Domain Resembling a Cryptocurrency-Lending Platform:**
     - Registering a domain that resembles a legitimate cryptocurrency-lending platform is a common tactic in the resource development phase. It helps in making the domain appear legitimate to potential victims, increasing the likelihood of successful distribution of the Bankshot implant.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical attack lifecycle. After reconnaissance, the attackers would likely move to resource development to set up the necessary infrastructure, including registering a malicious domain.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that Hidden Cobra would proceed to distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
