### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Taidoor malware, after communicating with the C&C server using RC4 encryption and the victim's MAC address as an encryption key, is likely to upload files to the C&C server for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the exfiltration of data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. This is a common method for malware to send stolen data back to the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to encrypt C2 communications. The use of the victim's MAC address as an encryption key is a specific implementation detail.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that the malware is already communicating with the C&C server using RC4 encryption, it is highly likely that the next step in the attack sequence would be to exfiltrate data. The use of the same C2 channel for exfiltration (T1041) is a common and efficient method for malware to send stolen data back to the attacker.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the malware does not exfiltrate data, which is less likely given the context. Malware typically aims to steal and exfiltrate data, and the use of a C2 channel for communication suggests that the malware is capable of and likely to perform data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will upload files to the C&C server for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
