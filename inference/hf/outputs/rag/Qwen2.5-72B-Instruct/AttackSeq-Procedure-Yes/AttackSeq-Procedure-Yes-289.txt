### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor, after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware, is likely to iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions:** This technique involves adversaries using browser extensions to maintain persistence. This can be used to ensure that the backdoor remains active even after the browser is restarted.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves adversaries stealing credentials from web browsers, which can include passwords stored in browsers like Google Chrome.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTP T1555.003 (Credentials from Web Browsers) directly supports the idea that the backdoor could steal credentials from web browsers, including Google Chrome.
     - The sequence of events described in the question (evading defenses, decoding blobs, downloading additional malware) aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated malware, which often includes credential theft as part of its attack chain.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the backdoor does not engage in credential theft, which is less likely given the related TTP T1555.003 and the sophisticated nature of the Dropping Elephant backdoor.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of sophisticated malware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Dropping Elephant backdoor would indeed iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
