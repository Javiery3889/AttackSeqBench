### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers used 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' to establish backdoor access and installed additional malware to access user databases.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the infected computers communicated with a command and control (C2) server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver, which is a method where the malware uses a domain name to resolve to a C2 server. The domain name is often hardcoded or generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA).
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using the Domain Name System (DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. DNS is often used to resolve domain names to IP addresses, which can be used to establish communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the TTPs, it is highly likely that the infected computers would communicate with the C2 server using DNS to resolve the domain 'update.alyac.org' to the IP address 116.127.121.41.
     - The use of a dead drop resolver (T1102.001) and DNS (T1071.004) aligns with the scenario where the domain is used to establish communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the infected computers did not communicate with the C2 server, which is less likely given the TTPs and the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the infected computers did communicate with the C2 server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
