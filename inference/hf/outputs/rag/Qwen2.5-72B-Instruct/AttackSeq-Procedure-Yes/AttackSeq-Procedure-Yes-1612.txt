### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
     - They established command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware.
     - They used this C&C communication to poll remote servers for tasks and execute commands.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that they deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leave ransom notes in encrypted directories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access by the victim, which is a common tactic used by ransomware.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for C&C communication, which is different from the 2048-bit RSA algorithm mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique aligns with the deployment of ransomware, which typically encrypts files to prevent access and demands a ransom.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique is about C&C communication, which is already established in the question. However, it does not directly relate to the encryption of files using RSA.
   - **Hermes Ransomware:**
     - Hermes ransomware is known for encrypting files and leaving ransom notes. It often uses RSA encryption for the encryption key, which is then used to encrypt files with a symmetric algorithm.
     - The use of a 2048-bit RSA algorithm is consistent with the encryption methods used by ransomware to secure the encryption key.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     - The Lazarus group established C&C communication.
     - They used this communication to execute commands.
     - Deploying Hermes ransomware to encrypt files and leave ransom notes is a logical next step in an impact phase of an attack.
   - The use of a 2048-bit RSA algorithm for encrypting files is consistent with known ransomware practices.
