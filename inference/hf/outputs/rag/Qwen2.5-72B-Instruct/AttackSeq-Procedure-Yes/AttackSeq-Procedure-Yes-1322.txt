### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that CosmicDuke might follow after achieving persistence.
   - Specifically, it asks if CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations before collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that CosmicDuke has achieved persistence by creating a scheduled task.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This reinforces that the scheduled task is used for execution, likely to maintain persistence and ensure the malware runs at specific intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Execution**: The related TTPs confirm that CosmicDuke has achieved persistence and can execute its payload using a scheduled task.
   - **Discovery Operations**: The question mentions searching for files and targeting non-English filenames. This is a common discovery technique used by malware to identify and exfiltrate sensitive information.
   - **Collection Operations**: The question also mentions using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. These are typical collection techniques used by malware to gather information from the victim's system.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After achieving persistence, it is logical for CosmicDuke to perform discovery operations to identify valuable files and data.
   - Targeting non-English filenames is a specific technique that might be used to avoid detection or to focus on files that are less likely to be monitored.
   - Following discovery, the malware would then proceed to collect information using various methods such as keylogging, taking screenshots, and stealing clipboard data.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence of operations (persistence, discovery, and collection), it is plausible that CosmicDuke would search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations before collecting information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
