### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the CopyKittens group is likely to use a global mutex to prevent multiple instances of the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) from running simultaneously after ensuring persistence via a registry key.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves creating a registry key or placing a file in the startup folder to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs in.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence, such as registry run keys, which is already mentioned in the first TTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Key for Persistence:**
     - The question states that the RAT component of Matryoshka ensures persistence by creating a registry key. This is a common technique used by malware to maintain a foothold on the system.
   - **Global Mutex:**
     - A global mutex is a synchronization object that can be used to ensure that only one instance of a program runs at a time. This is a common practice in malware to avoid conflicts and reduce the risk of detection.
   - **CopyKittens Group:**
     - CopyKittens is a known threat actor group that has been observed using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection. Using a global mutex to prevent multiple instances of the RAT from running simultaneously is a logical step to ensure the stability and stealth of their operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophistication of the CopyKittens group and the common practice of using global mutexes in malware to prevent multiple instances, it is likely that they would use a global mutex in this scenario.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
