### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla, after using an encrypted file system for defense evasion, is likely to include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include documents, files, and other local data.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves using a hidden file system to store stolen data and tools, which helps in evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which can include document management systems, databases, and other centralized data stores.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique is used for defense evasion, specifically to hide stolen data and tools. It aligns with the first part of the question where Turla uses an encrypted file system.
   - **T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique is used for collecting data from information repositories, which can include documents. This aligns with the second part of the question about collecting data from information repositories.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** While this technique is related to collecting data, it is more focused on local data rather than information repositories. However, it can be considered as part of a broader data collection strategy.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that Turla uses a hidden file system for defense evasion, it is logical that they would also use specialized tools to collect data from information repositories, which can include document stealers. The use of document stealers aligns with the T1213 technique, which is specifically about collecting data from information repositories.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Turla would include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
