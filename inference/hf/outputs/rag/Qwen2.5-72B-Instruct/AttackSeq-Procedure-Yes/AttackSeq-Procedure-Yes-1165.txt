### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a zero-day exploit in a Word document is used to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves checking user activity to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
     - The related TTPs include T1497.002 (User Activity Based Checks), which is a technique used to avoid detection. This aligns with the idea that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines to avoid detection.
     - The other related TTPs (T1005 and T1083) are focused on data collection and discovery, which are typical actions taken after avoiding detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Longhorn's tools will not follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
     - This would imply that Longhorn's tools would perform discovery and collection without first ensuring they are not detected, which is less likely given the sophisticated nature of espionage-focused malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a sophisticated attack, it is more plausible that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
