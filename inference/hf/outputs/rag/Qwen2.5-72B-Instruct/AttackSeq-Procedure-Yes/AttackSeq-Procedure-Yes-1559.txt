### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the context of the Operation NightScout attack campaign.
   - The sequence starts with an Initial Access tactic through a supply chain attack targeting the update mechanism of NoxPlayer.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attack will execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory.
   - Finally, it asks if the attack will employ defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL Side-Loading involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, often by placing the malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate one.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - DLL Injection involves injecting a malicious DLL into the memory space of a running process, often to execute code in the context of that process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a supply chain attack targeting the update mechanism of NoxPlayer. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Malicious MFC Dialog Application:**
     - The question mentions a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory. This is a plausible step in an attack, as it can be used to obfuscate the malicious payload and evade detection.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):**
       - This technique aligns with the idea of loading a malicious DLL, which is consistent with the described sequence.
     - **Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001):**
       - This technique involves injecting a DLL into a running process, which is a common method for executing code in the context of a trusted process and evading detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described and the related techniques, it is highly likely that the attack campaign Operation NightScout would execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory and then employ defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
