### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers.
   - It asks whether it is likely that attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves using XOR encoding to obfuscate or encrypt files, making it harder for defenders to detect or analyze the malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service:**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the target's network or system resources, causing it to become unavailable or to fail.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of XOR encoding (T1027.013) suggests that the attackers are trying to evade detection, which is a common tactic in cyber operations.
     - The DDoS attack (T1499) is a direct impact technique that can cause a 'total failure' of a network, which aligns with the described outcome of Next Media's network suffering a 'total failure'.
     - The combination of these techniques (encoding to evade detection and DDoS to cause impact) is consistent with a sophisticated attack campaign.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the observed XOR encoding and the described impact on Next Media's network are not related or that the DDoS attack did not occur.
     - However, the related TTPs strongly suggest that the encoding and the DDoS attack are part of the same campaign.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the attackers did launch DDoS attacks against the targeted websites, causing the described impact.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
