### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor (Dropping Elephant) downloads encoded blobs, which are then decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion. The question then asks if it is likely that a file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the use of automated tools to collect data from various sources, such as files, databases, or network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system to identify potential targets for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will indeed iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The related TTPs provide a logical sequence:
         - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** The encoded blobs are decoded to PowerShell scripts, which is a step in defense evasion.
         - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** After the scripts are executed, the file-stealer module would likely use this technique to discover files and directories.
         - **T1119-Automated Collection:** Once the directories are discovered, the file-stealer module would automate the collection of files with specific extensions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will not iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate a sequence of discovery and automated collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, the most plausible answer is that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
