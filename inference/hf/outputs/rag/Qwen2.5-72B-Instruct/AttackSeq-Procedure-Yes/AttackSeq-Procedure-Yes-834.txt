### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where WinDealer stages and encrypts stolen data in the %TEMP% directory as ".a" files during the Exfiltration phase.
   - It then asks if WinDealer is likely to use UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 for command and control (C2) communications, including sending an encrypted AES key to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for standard network communications, such as raw sockets or custom protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):**
     - This technique aligns with the scenario where data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communications. This suggests that the same ports used for C2 could be used for exfiltration.
   - **Non-Application Layer Protocol (T1095):**
     - This technique suggests the use of non-standard ports and protocols, which could include UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556. These ports are not commonly used for standard applications, making them suitable for C2 communications to avoid detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The use of non-standard ports (UDP 6999 and TCP 55556) aligns with the T1095 technique, which involves using non-application layer protocols.
   - The exfiltration of data over the same C2 channel (T1041) supports the idea that these ports could be used for both C2 and exfiltration.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that WinDealer would use these ports for C2 communications, including sending an encrypted AES key to the C2 server.
