### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Carbanak group, after using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network, is likely to have moved laterally across the infrastructure to target internal hosts and servers before preparing and collecting documents for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending stolen data back to the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Carbanak group did move laterally across the infrastructure and then prepared and collected documents for exfiltration.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The use of Cobalt Strike for network discovery and mapping is a common initial step in a multi-stage attack.
       - After mapping the network, it is logical for the attackers to move laterally to gain access to more systems and gather more information.
       - The related TTP T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) supports the idea of moving laterally by transferring tools to other systems.
       - Once the attackers have access to multiple systems, they would likely prepare and collect documents, which aligns with the T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Carbanak group did not move laterally or prepare and collect documents for exfiltration.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the typical attack pattern described by the related TTPs.
       - It is unlikely that the attackers would stop after mapping the network without further action, especially given the sophisticated nature of the Carbanak group.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Carbanak group did move laterally across the infrastructure and then prepared and collected documents for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
