### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after using a commercial packer like 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion, the malware will execute commands to gather system information and send the results back to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves the malware gathering information about the network configuration of the system, such as IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the malware gathering basic system information, such as the operating system version, architecture, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed gather system information and send it back to the C&C servers.
     - The related TTPs (T1016 and T1082) are both part of the Discovery tactic, which aligns with the malware's need to gather system information.
     - After evading defenses using a commercial packer, it is common for malware to perform discovery to understand the environment it is in and to exfiltrate this information to the C&C server for further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not gather system information and send it back to the C&C servers.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware is designed to gather system information as part of its attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware after evading defenses, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will gather system information and send it back to the C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
