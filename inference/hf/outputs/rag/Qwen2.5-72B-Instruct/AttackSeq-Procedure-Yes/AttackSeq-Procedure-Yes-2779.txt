### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain before presenting a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.
   - The context involves a spearphishing campaign where the actor impersonated a prominent Israeli physicist.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that lead to attacker-controlled resources.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing links to gather information about the target, which can be used to refine future attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the phishing emails included a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain before presenting a forged Microsoft login page.
     - This aligns with the T1566.002 technique, which involves sending spearphishing emails with links to attacker-controlled resources.
     - It is common for attackers to use a multi-step process where the initial link leads to a controlled domain, which then redirects to a credential harvesting page.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the phishing emails did not include a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain before presenting a forged Microsoft login page.
     - This would imply a more direct approach, which is less common in sophisticated campaigns like those associated with TA453.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in spearphishing campaigns, it is more likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain before presenting a forged Microsoft login page.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
