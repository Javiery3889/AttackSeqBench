### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Ke3chang is likely to perform inter-process communication using TidePool malware before achieving persistence through the creation of an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry.
   - The initial access is gained via spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This indicates that the initial access is achieved through phishing, which aligns with the spear phishing emails mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is used to achieve persistence by creating registry run keys or startup folder entries.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This is the same technique as above, reinforcing the method of achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The question states that initial access is gained via spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545. This aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique.
   - **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using TidePool malware:** The question mentions the use of TidePool malware for inter-process communication. However, the related TTPs do not specifically mention TidePool or inter-process communication.
   - **Persistence through ActiveSetup key:** The related TTPs mention the creation of registry run keys, which is a method of achieving persistence. The ActiveSetup key is a specific type of registry run key.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs focus on initial access and persistence but do not mention inter-process communication or TidePool malware.
   - Given the context, it is more likely that Ke3chang would focus on achieving persistence through the creation of an ActiveSetup key after gaining initial access, rather than performing inter-process communication using TidePool malware first.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
