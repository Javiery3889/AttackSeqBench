### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will perform specific actions during the Discovery phase after initial access via malicious documents with VBA macros.
   - The actions in question are:
     - Sandbox and virtual environment detection
     - Retrieving installed software lists
     - Gathering process and hard drive information
   - These actions are performed using the AutoIt downloader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:**
     - This technique involves checking the system for specific characteristics to determine if it is a virtualized or sandboxed environment.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization and sandboxing tools, which is a common tactic used by advanced malware to avoid analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that the initial access is established via malicious documents containing VBA macros. This is a common method used by the Sednit group to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question asks about actions performed during the Discovery phase. The related TTPs (T1497.001 and T1497) are both part of the Discovery tactic, which aligns with the question.
   - **Specific Actions:**
     - **Sandbox and virtual environment detection:** This is directly covered by T1497.001 and T1497.
     - **Retrieving installed software lists and gathering process and hard drive information:** These actions are part of the broader Discovery phase, where the malware gathers information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities.
   - **AutoIt Downloader:**
     - The AutoIt downloader is a tool that can be used to perform various actions, including those mentioned in the question. It is plausible that the Sednit group would use such a tool to gather the required information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the question with the related TTPs and the known tactics of the Sednit group, it is likely that the malware will perform the described actions during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
