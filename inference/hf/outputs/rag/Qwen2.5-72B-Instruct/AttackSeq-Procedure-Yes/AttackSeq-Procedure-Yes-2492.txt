### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Black Energy 2 will perform a specific sequence of actions:
     - Allocate memory in the `svchost.exe` process.
     - Launch the injected libraryâ€™s code using APC queue processing.
     - Evade defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC):**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process by queuing an APC to the target process's thread. The injected code is executed when the thread processes the APC.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055 - Process Injection:**
     - This is a broader category that includes various methods of injecting code into a process, including APC injection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Memory Allocation in `svchost.exe`:**
     - `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. Malware often targets this process for injection because it is trusted by the system.
   - **APC Queue Processing:**
     - APC injection is a common method used by malware to execute code in the context of a target process. It is a specific form of process injection.
   - **Evading Defenses:**
     - Encrypting the payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine are common techniques used to evade detection and analysis.
   - **Black Energy 2:**
     - Black Energy 2 is a known malware family that has been observed using advanced techniques for persistence and evasion, including process injection and APC injection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the capabilities and behaviors of Black Energy 2. The use of APC injection for process injection, memory allocation in `svchost.exe`, and evasion techniques such as payload encryption and direct plugin loading are all consistent with the TTPs of this malware.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
