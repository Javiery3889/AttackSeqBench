### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor after monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.
   - The key points are:
     - Monitoring running processes (Discovery tactic).
     - Modifying the Orion source code (Impact tactic).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying running processes, which aligns with the monitoring of MsBuild.exe.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1565.001-Stored Data Manipulation:**
     - This technique involves altering data stored on a system, which aligns with modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code after monitoring processes.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1057-Process Discovery** (monitoring processes) is a logical first step to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
       - **T1565.001-Stored Data Manipulation** (modifying the source code) is a subsequent step that aligns with the Impact tactic, where the adversary would inject the backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code after monitoring processes.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as the sequence of monitoring processes followed by modifying the source code is a logical and documented attack pattern.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of the attack, the most plausible answer is that SUNSPOT will indeed modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor after monitoring running processes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
