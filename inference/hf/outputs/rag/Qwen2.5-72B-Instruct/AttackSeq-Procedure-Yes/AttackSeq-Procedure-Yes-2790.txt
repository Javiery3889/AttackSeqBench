### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the XAgent app, after executing and hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices, is likely to collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about running processes on a system to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app will collect a list of processes for discovery before exfiltrating the data.
     - Given the related TTPs, this sequence is plausible. The app would likely use process discovery (T1057) to gather information about running processes, which is a common step in understanding the environment and identifying valuable data to exfiltrate.
     - After discovering the processes, the app would then exfiltrate the gathered information, including the processes data, to the C2 server (T1020).

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app will not collect a list of processes for discovery before exfiltrating the data.
     - This sequence is less plausible because it skips a crucial step in the attack lifecycle. Without process discovery, the app would have less context about the environment and might miss valuable data to exfiltrate.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a typical attack, the most plausible answer is that the XAgent app will collect a list of processes for discovery before exfiltrating the data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
