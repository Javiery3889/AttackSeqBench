### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of WINDSHIFT APT using specific techniques during the Credential Access phase after conducting long-term monitoring and tracking via social media and benign emails during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials from various sources, which is relevant to the Credential Access phase.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious sites, which is relevant to both the Reconnaissance and Credential Access phases.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - WINDSHIFT APT uses social media platforms for long-term monitoring and tracking via benign emails and tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com. This aligns with the T1598.003-Spearphishing Link technique, as it involves gathering information about the target.
   - **Credential Access Phase:**
     - The question asks if WINDSHIFT APT will send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates.
     - This aligns with the T1589.001-Credentials technique, as it involves collecting credentials through phishing methods.
     - Using HTTPS with free SSL certificates is a common tactic to make the phishing sites appear more legitimate and trustworthy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will use these methods during the Credential Access phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
