### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial attack vector is the exploitation of the Microsoft Office DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attacker (Gallmaker) would use tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks before employing living off the land (LotL) tactics to evade detection and remove tools from victim machines.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Attack Vector (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange):**
     - The attack starts with exploiting the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory. This is a common initial attack vector for many malware and APT groups.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to establish persistence to ensure they can maintain access to the victim's system over time. Using scheduled tasks is a well-known method for achieving this.
   - **Living Off the Land (LotL) Tactics:**
     - LotL tactics involve using legitimate system tools and processes to perform malicious activities, which helps in evading detection. This is a common follow-up step after establishing persistence to clean up and avoid detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the typical attack lifecycle:
     1. **Initial Exploitation (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange):** Gain initial access.
     2. **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):** Establish persistence using scheduled tasks.
     3. **Living Off the Land (LotL) Tactics:** Use legitimate tools to evade detection and clean up.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
