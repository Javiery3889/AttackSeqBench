### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Blind Eagle's attack sequence involves a specific sequence of TTPs:
     - Using a JavaScript downloader.
     - Employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs.
     - Leveraging a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBScript) to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **JavaScript Downloader:**
     - The question mentions a JavaScript downloader, but the related TTPs do not explicitly mention JavaScript. However, JavaScript can be used to download and execute other scripts, including PowerShell scripts.
   - **ActiveXObject to Execute PowerShell:**
     - ActiveXObject is a feature in Internet Explorer that allows JavaScript to interact with the underlying system. It can be used to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **PowerShell Commands Hosted on Discord CDNs:**
     - The related TTPs mention the use of PowerShell (T1059.001), which aligns with the question's mention of executing PowerShell commands.
   - **VBScript in the Startup Folder:**
     - The related TTPs mention the use of Visual Basic (T1059.005), which aligns with the question's mention of using a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs support the use of PowerShell and VBScript, which are key components of the attack sequence described in the question.
   - The sequence of using a JavaScript downloader to execute PowerShell commands and then using a VBScript for persistence is a plausible attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
