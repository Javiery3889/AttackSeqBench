### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the DNSpionage malware, after employing defense evasion techniques, is likely to enter a discovery phase to retrieve the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information before using HTTP and DNS for command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1140):** The malware uses password-protected macros and string obfuscation to evade detection. This is a common initial step to ensure the malware can run without being detected by security software.
   - **Discovery Phase:** After evading defenses, it is common for malware to gather information about the infected system. This includes retrieving the username, hostname, and domain information. This information is crucial for the malware to understand the environment it is operating in and to tailor its actions accordingly.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS):** Once the malware has gathered the necessary information, it will typically establish communication with the C2 server. Using DNS for C2 communication is a common technique because DNS traffic is often allowed through firewalls and is less likely to be flagged as malicious.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack pattern. After evading defenses, the malware would likely gather system information (discovery phase) before establishing C2 communication. This ensures that the malware has the necessary information to communicate effectively with the C2 server.

### Final Answer
