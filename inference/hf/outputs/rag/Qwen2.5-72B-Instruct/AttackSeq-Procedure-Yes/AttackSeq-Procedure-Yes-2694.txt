### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Elfin, after establishing command and control (C2) using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, is likely to have exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications. This is common because it can help avoid detection by blending in with normal C2 traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different protocol than the one used for C2. This can be used to bypass network defenses that might be monitoring the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Elfin has already established C2 using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT. It is plausible that they would use a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for exfiltration. FastUploader, designed for faster data transfer, aligns with the goal of efficiently exfiltrating data.
     - The use of a custom .NET FTP tool can be seen as an alternative protocol (T1048) or as a method to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel (T1041) if the FTP tool is configured to use the same C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Elfin would not use a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for exfiltration. However, given the established C2 and the need for efficient data transfer, this seems less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is more plausible that Elfin would use a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
