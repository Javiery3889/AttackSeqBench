### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aria-body backdoor:
     - Achieves persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
     - Injects itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe'.
   - The question then asks if it is likely to gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version for discovery purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique describes how an adversary can achieve persistence by adding a program to the 'Run' keys in the Windows Registry or the 'Startup' folder.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves an adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system version, installed software, and other system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001):**
     - The Aria-body backdoor achieves persistence by adding itself to the 'Run' keys or 'Startup' folder, which aligns with the described behavior in the question.
   - **Discovery (T1082):**
     - After achieving persistence and injecting itself into system processes, it is common for malware to gather information about the victim's machine to understand the environment and plan further actions.
     - The technique T1082 (System Information Discovery) specifically mentions gathering details about the system, including the operating system version and installed software, which is exactly what the question is asking about.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware to gather system information after achieving persistence, the most plausible answer is that the Aria-body backdoor is likely to gather information about the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
