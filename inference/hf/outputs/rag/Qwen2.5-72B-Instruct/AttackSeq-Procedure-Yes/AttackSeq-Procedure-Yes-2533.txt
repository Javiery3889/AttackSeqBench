### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Deep Panda, after exfiltrating data over the C2 channel using the Milestone backdoor, initially gained access by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. The Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers is a specific example of this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Deep Panda likely used the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers to gain initial access.
     - Given that the Log4Shell vulnerability is a well-known and widely exploited public-facing application vulnerability, it is plausible that Deep Panda could have used it to gain initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Deep Panda did not use the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers to gain initial access.
     - While there are other methods for gaining initial access, the related TTPs specifically mention the exploitation of public-facing applications, which aligns with the Log4Shell vulnerability.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) is a common method for initial access.
   - The Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers is a specific and relevant example of this technique.
   - Given the context and the plausibility of using a well-known vulnerability like Log4Shell, it is reasonable to conclude that Deep Panda likely used this method to gain initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
