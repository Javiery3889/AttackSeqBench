### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva, after creating a new service for persistence and decrypting strings for defense evasion, is likely to obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves using built-in or third-party libraries to compress files.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves using custom code to compress files.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
     - Creating a new service for persistence (T1543.003) and decrypting strings for defense evasion (T1027) are initial steps in the attack sequence.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Before compressing files, an adversary typically needs to know which files to compress. This is where file and directory discovery (T1083) comes into play. It is a logical step for the adversary to discover the files and directories they want to collect.
   - **Collection:**
     - After discovering the files, the adversary can then proceed to compress them using zlib (T1560.002 or T1560.003).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs, it is highly likely that Vyveva will obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
