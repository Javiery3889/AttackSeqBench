### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group is likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment (including registry keys enumeration and running process listing) before scanning for files matching specific extensions on local and network drives, after performing defense evasion by deleting files and disabling security tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the victim's system, which can include files, registry keys, and other system information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on the victim's system, which can be used to locate specific files or directories of interest.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Sednit group is likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment before scanning for files.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1012-Query Registry** and **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** are both discovery techniques that align with gathering information about the system.
       - **T1119-Automated Collection** can be used to collect the gathered information, which can include registry keys and file listings.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Sednit group is not likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment before scanning for files.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that the group would likely perform discovery and collection activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the Sednit group is likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment before scanning for files.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
