### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SBDH malware, after collecting targeted data using filters, is likely to use HTTP and SMTP protocols for network communication with its C&C server under the Command and Control tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS for communication with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1205.002-Socket Filters:**
     - This technique involves the use of socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic, which can be used to hide or modify communication with a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the SBDH malware is likely to use HTTP and SMTP protocols for network communication with its C&C server.
     - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols directly supports this choice, as it indicates that web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) are commonly used for C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the SBDH malware is not likely to use HTTP and SMTP protocols for network communication with its C&C server.
     - The related TTP T1205.002-Socket Filters does not directly support this choice, as it focuses on intercepting and manipulating network traffic rather than specifying the protocols used.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols, which explicitly mentions the use of web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for C&C communication, the most plausible answer is that the SBDH malware is likely to use HTTP and SMTP protocols for network communication with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
