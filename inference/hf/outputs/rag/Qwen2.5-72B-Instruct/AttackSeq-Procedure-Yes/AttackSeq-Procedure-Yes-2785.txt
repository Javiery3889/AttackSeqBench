### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the XAgent app, after collecting data from iOS devices, will exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests while using a Base64 encoded token for identification with its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding schemes (like Base64) to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app will exfiltrate data via HTTP requests and use a Base64 encoded token for identification with its C&C server.
     - **Supporting Evidence:**
       - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** The use of Base64 encoding for the token aligns with this technique.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** The exfiltration of data over the same channel used for C2 communications aligns with this technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app will not exfiltrate data via HTTP requests or use a Base64 encoded token for identification with its C&C server.
     - **Contradicting Evidence:**
       - The related TTPs clearly indicate that both encoding and exfiltration over the C2 channel are common techniques used in such scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the alignment with the described attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the XAgent app will exfiltrate data via HTTP requests while using a Base64 encoded token for identification with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
