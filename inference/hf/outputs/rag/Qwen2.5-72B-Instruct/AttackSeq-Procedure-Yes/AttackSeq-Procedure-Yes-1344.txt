### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers used DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor after exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 vulnerability in MS Exchange for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. In this case, the vulnerability is CVE-2021-26855 in MS Exchange.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application):**
     - The attackers exploited CVE-2021-26855 to gain initial access to the network. This is a common and well-documented technique for initial access.
   - **DLL Hijacking:**
     - DLL hijacking is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL. This can be used to execute arbitrary code when a legitimate application loads the malicious DLL.
   - **ShadowPad Backdoor:**
     - ShadowPad is a backdoor that has been used in various cyberattacks. It is typically used to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system.
   - **Stealing Domain Authentication Credentials:**
     - After gaining initial access and potentially deploying a backdoor, attackers often steal domain authentication credentials to further their access and move laterally within the network.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Exploit CVE-2021-26855 (T1190):**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attackers gain initial access.
   - **DLL Hijacking:**
     - While DLL hijacking can be used to execute arbitrary code, it is not a common or necessary step immediately after gaining initial access through a known vulnerability. It is more often used in the context of persistence or privilege escalation.
   - **Execute ShadowPad Backdoor:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is more likely that the attackers would directly deploy the ShadowPad backdoor to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Steal Domain Authentication Credentials:**
     - Once the backdoor is in place, the attackers can then proceed to steal domain authentication credentials to further their access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, it is not likely that the attackers used DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor immediately after exploiting CVE-2021-26855. The more plausible sequence is that they directly deployed the ShadowPad backdoor after gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
