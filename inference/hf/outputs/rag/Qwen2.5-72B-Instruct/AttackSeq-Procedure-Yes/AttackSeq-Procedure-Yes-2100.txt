### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attackers gather detailed information about the victim's computer (hostname, OS name, system type, and anti-virus information) and then install a backdoor.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information through the established C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for attackers to send stolen data back to their servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering detailed information about the victim's system, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the attackers gather information about the victim's computer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Information Gathering (T1082-System Information Discovery):**
     - The attackers gather detailed information about the victim's computer, which is a common first step in many cyber attacks. This helps them understand the environment and plan their next steps.
   - **Backdoor Installation and C&C Communication:**
     - After gathering the information, the attackers install a backdoor. It is highly likely that this backdoor will communicate with a C&C server to receive further instructions and to exfiltrate data.
   - **Encrypted Communication:**
     - Modern backdoors often use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers to avoid detection by network security tools. This is a common practice to ensure that the communication is not intercepted or monitored.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel):**
     - Once the backdoor is installed and the C&C communication is established, the attackers will use this channel to exfiltrate data such as screenshots and system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is highly likely that the backdoor will communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
