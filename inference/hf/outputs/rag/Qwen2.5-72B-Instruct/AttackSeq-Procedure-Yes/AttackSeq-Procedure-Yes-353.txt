### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after using T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to evade defenses, the threat actors then used T1057 Process Discovery to gain knowledge about the systems and internal networks before leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls to evade defenses, such as modifying security software or system configurations.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This sub-technique involves using DNS for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:**
     - This technique is used to evade defenses, which is a crucial step in the initial stages of an attack to ensure that the threat actors can operate undetected.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system, which is often used to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique is used for command and control (C2) communications, allowing the threat actors to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Step 1: T1553 Subvert Trust Controls**
       - The threat actors subvert trust controls to evade defenses, ensuring they can operate without being detected.
     - **Step 2: T1057 Process Discovery**
       - After evading defenses, the threat actors would likely use process discovery to gather information about the systems and internal networks. This step is crucial for understanding the environment and identifying potential targets.
     - **Step 3: T1071 Application Layer Protocol**
       - Once the threat actors have a good understanding of the environment, they would then set up command and control communications using standard application layer protocols to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery after subverting trust controls and before setting up command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
