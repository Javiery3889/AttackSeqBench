### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PROMETHIUM is likely to encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server after compressing Microsoft Office files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This sub-technique involves using a custom method to archive data, which could include unusual encoding schemes.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique involves breaking data into smaller chunks to avoid detection during exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This confirms that PROMETHIUM compresses or archives data, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This suggests that PROMETHIUM might use a custom method to archive data, which could include encoding the archives with an unusual scheme.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This indicates that PROMETHIUM might split the data into smaller chunks to avoid detection during exfiltration, which aligns with the second part of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that PROMETHIUM would encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server. The techniques T1560.003 and T1030 support this sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
