### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C (Command and Control) communication after the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique indicates that the adversary uses web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting detailed information about the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):**
     - The Aria-body backdoor is collecting detailed information from the victim's machine, which aligns with the T1082 technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):**
     - After collecting the information, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to communicate this information back to the C&C server. The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication is a common and effective method for maintaining stealth and reliability.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor collects information (T1082).
     - The collected information is sent back to the C&C server using HTTP and TCP protocols (T1071.001).
     - The C&C server can then issue additional commands to the backdoor.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication after the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
