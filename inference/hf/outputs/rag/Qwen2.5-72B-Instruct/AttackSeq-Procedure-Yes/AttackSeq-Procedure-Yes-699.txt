### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Elderwood Project attackers are likely to establish command and control (C&C) servers after gaining initial access via zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves using a watering hole attack to deliver a payload to a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** The question mentions that the attackers use zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1189 technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication):** After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to establish C&C servers to maintain control over the compromised systems and to retrieve commands from the attackers. The T1071.001 and T1102.002 techniques support this by describing the use of web protocols and bidirectional communication, respectively.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is highly likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish C&C servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
