### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor, after establishing persistence, is likely to gather information from the victim's machine, including usernames, as part of its system reconnaissance activities before performing high-level collection tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is used to maintain persistence by adding a program to the 'Run' registry key or the 'Startup' folder, ensuring it runs every time the system starts.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This is the same technique as above, reinforcing the method of persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves the backdoor discovering files and directories on the victim's machine, which is a form of system reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The Aria-body loader uses the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key to establish persistence, which is confirmed by the related TTPs T1547.001.
   - **System Reconnaissance:**
     - After establishing persistence, it is common for malware to perform system reconnaissance to gather information about the victim's machine. This includes discovering files and directories (T1083) and potentially gathering usernames and other system information.
   - **High-Level Collection:**
     - System reconnaissance is typically a precursor to more advanced collection activities, such as file searching and metadata gathering. This is because the malware needs to understand the environment it is operating in to effectively perform these tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is highly likely that the Aria-body backdoor will perform system reconnaissance, including gathering usernames, before moving on to high-level collection tasks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
