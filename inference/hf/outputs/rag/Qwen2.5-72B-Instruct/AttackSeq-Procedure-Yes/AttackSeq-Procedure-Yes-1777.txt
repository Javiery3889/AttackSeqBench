### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Sayad malware is likely to capture screenshots after performing discovery and before exfiltrating the collected and encrypted data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots to gather visual information from the compromised host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The malware has already performed discovery by collecting system and application details.
   - **Collection Phase:** The related TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to engage in additional collection activities, such as screen capture (T1113), to gather more data.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** After collecting and possibly archiving the data (T1560), the malware will exfiltrate the data to a malicious web server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical attack lifecycle:
     1. **Discovery:** Collect system and application details.
     2. **Collection:** Capture additional data, such as screenshots.
     3. **Exfiltration:** Archive and exfiltrate the collected data.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that screen capture (T1113) is a common collection technique that can be performed after initial discovery and before exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
