### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to conduct discovery activities (specifically file and directory discovery) after harvesting credentials using the Responder tool and before achieving lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique involves using the Responder tool to poison LLMNR and NBT-NS requests to harvest credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the network to gather information about the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Credential Access (T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay):**
        - The Lazarus group uses the Responder tool to harvest credentials by poisoning LLMNR and NBT-NS requests. This is a common initial step to gain access to credentials.
     2. **Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery):**
        - After obtaining credentials, it is logical for the attackers to conduct discovery activities to understand the network environment better. This includes finding files and directories that may contain valuable information or that can be used to facilitate further attacks.
     3. **Lateral Movement:**
        - Once the attackers have a better understanding of the network and have identified potential targets, they can use techniques like WMIC and compromised routers to move laterally across the network and bypass network segmentation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, it is highly likely that the Lazarus group would conduct discovery activities such as file and directory discovery after harvesting credentials and before achieving lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
