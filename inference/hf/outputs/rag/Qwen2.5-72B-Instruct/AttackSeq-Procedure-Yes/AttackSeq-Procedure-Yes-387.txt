### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Vyveva, after performing file and directory listings and listing running processes during the Discovery phase, is likely to encrypt strings and components for Defense Evasion before compressing and collecting files for exfiltration during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving files using custom methods to prepare them for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory information to understand the system and identify potential targets for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question mentions that Vyveva has already performed file and directory listings and listed running processes. This aligns with the T1083 technique, which is part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question also mentions that Vyveva is compressing and collecting files for exfiltration. This aligns with the T1560.003 technique, which is part of the Collection phase.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The question asks whether Vyveva is likely to encrypt strings and components for Defense Evasion before the Collection phase. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention Defense Evasion, it is a common practice for adversaries to use encryption to avoid detection and analysis.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that encryption is a common technique used in Defense Evasion to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the malware and its components, it is plausible that Vyveva would encrypt strings and components before compressing and collecting files for exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs do not contradict this assumption, and the use of encryption is a logical step to ensure that the collected data remains undetected during exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
