### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021:
     - They accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials.
     - They dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.
     - The question asks if it is likely that they established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, allowing NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB to access and control remote systems, often using valid credentials.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Accessing Shared Folders via SMB:**
     - The use of SMB to access shared folders aligns with T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares.
   - **Step 2: Dropping NodeIISWeb Web Shell Loader:**
     - Dropping a web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement aligns with T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
   - **Step 3: Establishing Command and Control:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that they established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.
     - Deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process is a sophisticated technique that would allow the web shell to intercept and manipulate requests, providing backdoor functionality.
     - This technique is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible next step after gaining access and deploying a web shell.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of deploying an inline hook and the context of the question, it is reasonable to assume that such a technique could be used to establish command and control after gaining access and deploying a web shell.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
