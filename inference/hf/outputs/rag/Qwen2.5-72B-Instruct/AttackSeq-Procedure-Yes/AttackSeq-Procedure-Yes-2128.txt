### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after the 'versioninfo.bat' script collects system details and information for exfiltration, the 'stopedge.bat' script will manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts on a Windows system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of an attack and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that the 'stopedge.bat' script will manage the deletion of files to evade detection.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The 'versioninfo.bat' script is used to collect system details and information for exfiltration, which is part of the execution phase.
       - After the information is collected, it is common for attackers to use techniques to evade detection, such as deleting files that could be used as evidence.
       - The 'stopedge.bat' script could be designed to clean up after the 'versioninfo.bat' script by deleting it and other related files like 'update.vbs'.
       - The T1070.004-File Deletion technique aligns with this behavior, as it is a common method to remove traces of the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the 'stopedge.bat' script will manage the deletion of files to evade detection.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the common practices of attackers, who often use file deletion to cover their tracks.
       - The related TTPs, particularly T1070.004-File Deletion, strongly suggest that file deletion is a plausible and common step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the 'stopedge.bat' script will manage the deletion of files to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
