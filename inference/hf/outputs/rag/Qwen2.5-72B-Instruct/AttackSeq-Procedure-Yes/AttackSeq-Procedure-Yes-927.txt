### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to use a multi-tiered server backend framework, including static and dynamic update servers, for command and control after extracting administrator passwords using keylogging.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, such as passwords.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):** The campaign has already used keylogging to extract administrator passwords. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gain access to sensitive information.
   - **Multi-Stage Channels (T1104):** This technique suggests that the attackers are using a sophisticated approach to maintain control over the compromised systems. A multi-tiered server backend framework, including static and dynamic update servers, aligns with this technique.
   - **Bidirectional Communication (T1102.002):** This technique further supports the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework, as it involves maintaining a persistent and dynamic communication channel.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the Volatile Cedar campaign has already used keylogging to extract administrator passwords, it is likely that they will use a more sophisticated command and control infrastructure to maintain and expand their control over the compromised systems.
   - The related TTPs, particularly T1104 (Multi-Stage Channels) and T1102.002 (Bidirectional Communication), strongly suggest that a multi-tiered server backend framework is a plausible next step.
