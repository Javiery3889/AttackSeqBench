### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM actors are likely to have gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim, such as names, email addresses, and other personal details, which can be used to craft more convincing spear-phishing emails.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website that the victim is likely to visit, often through a watering hole attack, to deliver malware.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.002 - WHOIS:**
     - This technique involves using WHOIS services to gather information about domain registrations, which can help in understanding the victim's infrastructure and potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts.
     - **Supporting Evidence:**
       - **T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique is directly relevant to the question, indicating that gathering victim identity information is a common reconnaissance activity.
       - **T1596.002 - WHOIS:** This technique can provide additional context about the victim's domain and infrastructure, which can be used to refine the reconnaissance efforts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did not gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts.
     - **Supporting Evidence:**
       - There is no direct evidence in the related TTPs that contradicts the gathering of victim identity information. The presence of T1589 strongly suggests that this is a common practice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in reconnaissance, it is highly likely that ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
