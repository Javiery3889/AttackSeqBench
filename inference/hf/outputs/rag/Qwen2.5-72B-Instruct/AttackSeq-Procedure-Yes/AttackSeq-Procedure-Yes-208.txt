### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SparrowDoor, after collecting system information during the Discovery phase, is likely to read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system's owner and user information, such as usernames and account details.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves reading and collecting data from the local system, including file contents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The related TTPs T1082 and T1033 are both part of the Discovery phase, which aligns with the question's statement that SparrowDoor collects system information such as usernames, computer names, and file attributes.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The related TTP T1005 is part of the Collection phase, which involves reading and collecting data from the local system, including file contents.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The question mentions exfiltrating these files to the C&C server, which is a logical next step after collecting the data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the related TTP T1005 (Data from Local System) is part of the Collection phase and involves reading file contents, it is highly likely that SparrowDoor will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.
