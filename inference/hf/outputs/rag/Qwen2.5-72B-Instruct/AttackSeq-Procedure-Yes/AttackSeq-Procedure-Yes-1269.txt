### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where macro-enabled template files hosted on third-party services are used as phishing lures.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the threat actor, Yellow Garuda, will disrupt analysis efforts during defense evasion by remotely staging parts of the infection chain and employing RC4-encrypted strings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or payloads, making them harder to detect or analyze.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves methods to detect and evade virtualized environments or sandboxes, which are often used for malware analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Method:** The use of macro-enabled template files hosted on third-party services as phishing lures is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique is directly relevant to the use of RC4-encrypted strings, which can be used to obfuscate parts of the infection chain and make analysis more difficult.
     - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is relevant to disrupting analysis efforts by detecting and evading virtualized environments, which is another form of defense evasion.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Yellow Garuda will use these techniques during defense evasion. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that Yellow Garuda would employ RC4-encrypted strings to obfuscate parts of the infection chain and use techniques to evade virtualized environments to disrupt analysis efforts.
