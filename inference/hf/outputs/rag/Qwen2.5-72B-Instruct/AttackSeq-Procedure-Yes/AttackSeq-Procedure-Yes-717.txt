### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
     2. Communication with control servers using an encrypted channel (RC4).
     3. Exfiltration of data obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques (like Base64) to obfuscate or encode data before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable by the adversary.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - The question mentions gathering system and network information, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the target environment.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:**
     - The question states that the communication is encrypted using RC4. RC4 is a stream cipher that has been used in various malware for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - The data is obfuscated with Base64 encoding before exfiltration. This aligns with the T1132.001-Standard Encoding technique, which is used to make the data less recognizable and more difficult to detect.
   - **Deobfuscation:**
     - The T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information technique is relevant because the data needs to be deobfuscated on the control server to be usable.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance, encrypted communication, and Base64 obfuscation) is consistent with the related TTPs. The use of RC4 for encryption and Base64 for obfuscation are common techniques in malware communication and data exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
