### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase, after implementing file upload and download capabilities with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include recent files.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is a common step before collecting data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) is a discovery technique that helps the attacker understand the file structure and identify potential targets for data collection.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - T1005 (Data from Local System) and T1025 (Data from Removable Media) are collection techniques that involve gathering data from the local system and removable media, respectively.
   - **Backdoor Capabilities:**
     - The question mentions that Turla has implemented file upload and download capabilities with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase. This suggests that the backdoor is already capable of transferring files, which is a prerequisite for collecting data.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that Turla has the capability to discover files and directories (T1083) and can transfer files, it is highly plausible that Turla would use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives (T1005 and T1025) during the collection phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the capabilities described in the question, the most plausible answer is that Turla is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
