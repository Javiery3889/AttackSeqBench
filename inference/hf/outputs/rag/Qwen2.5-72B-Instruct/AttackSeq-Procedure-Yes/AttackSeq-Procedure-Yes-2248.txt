### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.
   - The sequence of events mentioned includes gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:**
     - This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Infection Chain:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain. This aligns with the use of malicious LNK files and the potential for DLL side-loading to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Exfiltration of Kavach Authentication Databases:**
     - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases. Kavach is a security software, and exfiltrating its authentication databases would be a valuable step in credential harvesting.
   - **Deployment of njRAT Malware:**
     - njRAT is a well-known malware used for credential harvesting and remote access. Deploying njRAT after exfiltrating authentication databases would be a logical next step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is plausible that SideCopy would exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases before deploying njRAT malware. This sequence aligns with the goals of credential harvesting and maintaining persistence.
