### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Russian-speaking cybercriminals are likely to download programs for remote administration tools (RATs) to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase after gaining initial access via spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or deploying malicious attachments.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to specific individuals or organizations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing and Spearphishing:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that the initial access is gained through phishing and spearphishing, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Execution Phase and RATs:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to use remote administration tools (RATs) to maintain persistence and further compromise the system.
     - Compromising administrators' credentials is a critical step in gaining deeper access and control over the network.
   - **Russian-speaking Cybercriminals:**
     - Russian-speaking cybercriminals are known for their sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques, often involving the use of RATs and credential theft to achieve their objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the common practices of Russian-speaking cybercriminals, it is highly likely that they will download programs for remote administration tools to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
