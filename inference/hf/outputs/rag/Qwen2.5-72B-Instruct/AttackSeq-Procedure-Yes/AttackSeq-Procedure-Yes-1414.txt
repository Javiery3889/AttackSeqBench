### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that other macOS malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) would use their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access before CrateDepression drops Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This TTP involves tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CrateDepression and Poseidon Payloads:**
     - CrateDepression is a specific malware that drops Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal'. This is an example of a supply chain attack where the malware is distributed through a compromised software package.
   - **Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis:**
     - **Alchimist:** Known for binding a shell to a port, which is a method for maintaining access and allowing remote control.
     - **ChromeLoader:** Known for spreading through DMGs (disk images), which is a common method for distributing malware on macOS.
     - **CloudMensis:** Known for exploiting CVE-2020-9934, a vulnerability in the macOS kernel.
   - **Initial Access Mechanisms:**
     - The question asks if these other malware would use their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access before CrateDepression drops its payload.
     - The related TTPs suggest that initial access can be gained through exploitation of remote services (T1210) and tricking users into opening malicious files (T1204.002).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **CrateDepression's Method:**
     - CrateDepression uses a supply chain attack, which is a different method from the initial access mechanisms of Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis.
   - **Other Malware's Methods:**
     - Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis use different methods for initial access, such as binding a shell to a port, spreading through DMGs, and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - It is unlikely that these other malware would use their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access before CrateDepression drops its payload. The methods are distinct and serve different purposes in the attack lifecycle.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
