### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT42 is likely to perform internal reconnaissance by accessing a compromised user’s contacts and collaborative spaces before proceeding with OS credential dumping for stealing credentials, after establishing persistence through scheduled tasks or Windows registry modifications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves accessing chat messages, which can be a form of internal reconnaissance to gather information about the compromised user's contacts and collaborative spaces.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves stealing credentials from the operating system, which is a common step in the credential access phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:** APT42, like many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, often establishes persistence through methods such as scheduled tasks or Windows registry modifications. This ensures they can maintain access to the compromised system over time.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** After establishing persistence, it is common for APT groups to perform internal reconnaissance to gather more information about the compromised environment. Accessing a compromised user’s contacts and collaborative spaces (T1552.008) is a form of internal reconnaissance that can provide valuable information about other potential targets within the network.
   - **OS Credential Dumping:** Once the APT group has gathered enough information through reconnaissance, they often proceed to steal credentials using techniques like OS credential dumping (T1003). This allows them to gain access to other systems and escalate their privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical attack sequence and the related TTPs, it is plausible that APT42 would perform internal reconnaissance by accessing a compromised user’s contacts and collaborative spaces before proceeding with OS credential dumping.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
