### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NanHaiShu, after gathering system information, is likely to communicate with C&C servers using HTTP POST and HTTP GET before downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the adversary uses web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This indicates that the adversary gathers system information such as IP Address, Volume Serial Number, and Computer Name.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** The question states that NanHaiShu gathers system information, which aligns with the T1082 technique.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001):** The question also mentions communication with C&C servers using HTTP POST and HTTP GET, which aligns with the T1071.001 technique.
   - **Downloading and Executing JScript and VBScript:** While the question mentions this, it is not directly supported by the provided TTPs. However, it is a common next step after establishing C&C communication to download and execute additional payloads.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (gathering system information, communicating with C&C servers using HTTP POST and HTTP GET, and then downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code) is a plausible and common attack sequence.
   - The provided TTPs support the first two steps of the sequence (system information discovery and C&C communication using web protocols).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
