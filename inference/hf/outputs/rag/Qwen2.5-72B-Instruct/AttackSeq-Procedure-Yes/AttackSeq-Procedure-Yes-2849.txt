### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where PowerShell scripts are used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts or commands. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute files, among other tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The use of PowerShell to download a Windows executable and a decoy document is a common tactic in malware campaigns. PowerShell is often used for initial execution and to download additional payloads.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The command and control phase typically involves the malware establishing communication with a remote server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
     - It is less common for a downloader to retrieve an image file containing encoded malware during the C2 phase. Typically, the C2 phase involves more direct communication, such as sending and receiving commands or data.
   - **Asruex Malware:**
     - Asruex malware is known to use various techniques for command and control, but it is not typically associated with retrieving image files containing encoded malware during the C2 phase. Instead, it often uses more direct methods for communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is less likely that the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase. The typical behavior of Asruex malware and the nature of the C2 phase suggest that more direct communication methods are used.

**Final Answer: B: No**
