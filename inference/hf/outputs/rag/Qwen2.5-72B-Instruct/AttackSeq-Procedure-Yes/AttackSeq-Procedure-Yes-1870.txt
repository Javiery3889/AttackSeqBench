### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Scote malware is likely to retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.
   - The key points are:
     - Scote malware uses techniques to evade detection.
     - It uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information.
     - The specific services mentioned are Pastebin and Google+.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves using web services to communicate with C2 servers in both directions (sending and receiving data).
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host C2 information and communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Scote malware is likely to retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts.
     - Given the related TTPs, this aligns well with the use of legitimate web services to host C2 information and facilitate bidirectional communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Scote malware is not likely to retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate the use of web services for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Scote malware retrieves C2 information from legitimate third-party online services like Pastebin or Google+ before communicating with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
