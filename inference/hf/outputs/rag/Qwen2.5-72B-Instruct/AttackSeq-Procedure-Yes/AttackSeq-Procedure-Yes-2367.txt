### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by a malware system after `netsat.exe` executes commands from an encrypted file to infect removable media and collect system files.
   - The question asks if it is likely for the malware to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence by deleting key artifacts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique involves the malware attempting to remove or alter indicators of its presence on the system to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware performing recursive directory listings to discover files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence.
     - This aligns with the related TTPs:
       - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** The malware would perform recursive directory listings to discover files and directories.
       - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** After collecting the necessary information, the malware would clean up indicators of its presence by deleting key artifacts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to perform these actions.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as both T1083 and T1070 are relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the malware is likely to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
