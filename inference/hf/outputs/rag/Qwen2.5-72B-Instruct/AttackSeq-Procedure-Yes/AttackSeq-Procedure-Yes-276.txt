### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that a PowerShell script (`fmx.ps1`) will decode and execute a base64 encoded script stored in `sdmc.jpg` before downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including executing malicious scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the content of the file or information understandable to the attacker. This is often used to hide the true nature of the payload until it is executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved by delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This is a common method for delivering malware, often through phishing emails.
   - **Execution of `fmx.ps1`:**
     - The `fmx.ps1` PowerShell script is likely to be executed as part of the initial access. PowerShell scripts are commonly used to automate the execution of malicious activities.
   - **Decoding `sdmc.jpg`:**
     - The `fmx.ps1` script is expected to decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in `sdmc.jpg`. This aligns with the T1140 technique, which involves deobfuscating or decoding files to reveal the actual payload.
   - **Downloading the Zip File:**
     - After decoding and executing the script from `sdmc.jpg`, the next logical step would be to download the zip file containing the components for the malware payload. This is a common sequence in multi-stage attacks where the initial script is used to download additional components.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described, it is likely that the `fmx.ps1` PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in `sdmc.jpg` before downloading the zip file containing the components for the malware payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
