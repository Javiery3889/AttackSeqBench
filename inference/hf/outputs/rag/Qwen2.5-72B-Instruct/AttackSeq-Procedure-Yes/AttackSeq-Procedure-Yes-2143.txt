### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry, the malware is likely to perform discovery by obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process before establishing command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - These TTPs focus on achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry, which is a common method for ensuring that the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder):** This technique is used to ensure that the malware is executed every time the system starts. It does not inherently involve discovery or C2 communication.
   - **Discovery:** After achieving persistence, it is common for malware to perform discovery to gather information about the system and the user. This can include obtaining the user name and identifying running processes like explorer.exe.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing C2 communication is a critical step for the malware to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Process Hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, which can be used to establish C2 communication.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     1. **Persistence:** The malware creates a RunOnce key in the registry to ensure it runs at startup.
     2. **Discovery:** The malware then performs discovery to gather information about the system and the user, including the user name and identifying the explorer process.
     3. **Command and Control (C2):** Finally, the malware establishes C2 communication through Process Hollowing.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
