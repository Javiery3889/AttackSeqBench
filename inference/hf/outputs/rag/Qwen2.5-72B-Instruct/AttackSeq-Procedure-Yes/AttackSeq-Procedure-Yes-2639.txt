### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete, after performing a series of data collection activities (stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data in a temporary folder), is likely to automatically exfiltrate all collected files to remote servers and the C&C server using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate. This aligns with the staging of encrypted data in a temporary folder.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending data back to the attacker's server. This aligns with the exfiltration of collected files to remote servers and the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Machete will automatically exfiltrate the collected files using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1560-Archive Collected Data** indicates that the data is compressed or archived, which is consistent with the staging of encrypted data in a temporary folder.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** indicates that the data is exfiltrated over a C2 channel, which is consistent with sending the data to remote servers and the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Machete will not automatically exfiltrate the collected files.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1560 and T1041 suggest that the data is prepared and exfiltrated.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that Machete will automatically exfiltrate the collected files using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
