### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a threat actor will ensure admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory before using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT for privilege escalation.
   - The sequence of events mentioned includes:
     - Achieving execution by deploying a JavaScript backdoor.
     - Installing the CARBANAK RAT.
     - Ensuring admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory.
     - Using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up persistence by configuring programs to automatically execute at system boot or user logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Achieving Execution:**
     - The threat actor has already achieved execution by deploying a JavaScript backdoor and installing the CARBANAK RAT. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
   - **Ensuring Admin Privileges:**
     - Ensuring admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory is a critical step for many threat actors, as it allows them to perform more advanced and impactful actions.
   - **Using RunPsExec:**
     - RunPsExec is a tool that can be used to execute commands on remote systems, often requiring administrative privileges. It is commonly used for lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - **Installing a PowerShell RAT:**
     - Installing a PowerShell RAT is a common technique for maintaining persistence and furthering the attack. This step often follows the acquisition of administrative privileges.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     - **Initial Execution:** Deploying a JavaScript backdoor and installing the CARBANAK RAT.
     - **Privilege Escalation:** Ensuring admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory.
     - **Lateral Movement and Further Privilege Escalation:** Using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT.
   - The related TTPs support the use of PowerShell for execution and the setup of persistence, which aligns with the steps described in the question.
