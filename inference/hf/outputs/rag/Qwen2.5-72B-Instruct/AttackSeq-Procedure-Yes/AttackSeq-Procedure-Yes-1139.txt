### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Buckeye, after using keyloggers and tools like ChromePass and Lazagne to gather credentials, is likely to focus on file and print servers to collect data from network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging (Tactic: Collection)**: This technique involves using keyloggers to capture keystrokes, which can include usernames and passwords.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive (Tactic: Collection)**: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which are often used to store important files and documents.
   - **T1552.001-Credentials In Files (Tactic: Credential Access)**: This technique involves accessing and extracting credentials stored in files, such as those used by ChromePass and Lazagne.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001)**: Buckeye has already used keyloggers to gather credentials, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gain access to the network.
   - **Credentials In Files (T1552.001)**: Tools like ChromePass and Lazagne are used to extract credentials from files, further enhancing the attacker's ability to move laterally within the network.
   - **Data from Network Shared Drive (T1039)**: After gaining credentials, it is logical for an attacker to focus on collecting data from network shared drives, as these often contain valuable information.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs (keylogging, credential extraction, and data collection from network shared drives) is a common and logical progression in a cyber attack. After obtaining credentials, an attacker like Buckeye would likely use these credentials to access and collect data from network shared drives.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
