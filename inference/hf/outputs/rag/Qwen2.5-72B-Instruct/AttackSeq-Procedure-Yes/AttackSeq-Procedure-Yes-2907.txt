### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 is likely to use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping after gaining initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials, and before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves obtaining credentials from various password stores.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT15 gains initial access using stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. This aligns with the T1078.002 technique.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT15 is likely to use tools like Mimikatz to dump OS credentials. This aligns with the T1555 and T1555.004 techniques, which involve obtaining credentials from password stores and the Windows Credential Manager.
   - **Execution Evasion and Command Execution:**
     - Once APT15 has additional credentials, they can use tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution. This is a logical next step after gaining additional credentials to maintain persistence and execute commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that APT15 would use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping after gaining initial access and before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
