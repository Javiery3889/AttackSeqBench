### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload on the system before the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique involves the attacker's use of methods to detect and evade debuggers, which can help in avoiding detection and analysis.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique is also related to detecting debuggers, but it is under the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information from the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by timing the execution of malicious activities to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Komplex Binder:**
     - The Komplex Binder is known for its ability to save and execute a second payload on the system. This is a common technique used to maintain persistence and ensure that the malware can continue to operate even if the initial payload is detected or removed.
   - **XAgent Debugger Evasion:**
     - XAgent, a component of the APT28/Sofacy group's toolkit, is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, including debugger evasion. This is crucial for the malware to avoid detection and analysis by security researchers and automated systems.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Initial Infection:**
     - The Komplex Binder is likely to be the initial payload that is delivered to the system. Its primary function is to save and execute a second payload, which is often the XAgent malware.
   - **Execution of Second Payload:**
     - Once the Komplex Binder has executed the second payload (XAgent), the XAgent component will then perform its own set of actions, including checking for the presence of a debugger to evade detection.
   - **Debugger Evasion:**
     - The XAgent component will likely perform debugger evasion techniques after it has been executed by the Komplex Binder. This is a logical sequence because the XAgent needs to ensure it is not being analyzed or detected once it is active on the system.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that the Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload on the system before the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
