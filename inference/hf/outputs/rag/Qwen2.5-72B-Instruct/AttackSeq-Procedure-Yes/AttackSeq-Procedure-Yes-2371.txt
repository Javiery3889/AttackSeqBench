### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Turla group using the LightNeuron malware on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using a PowerShell script to install LightNeuron.
     - Discovering system network configurations using LightNeuron's functions.
     - Collecting emails and exfiltrating local files based on specified rules.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.002 - Remote Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting emails from remote mail servers, which aligns with the part of the question about collecting emails.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering system network configurations, which aligns with the part of the question about discovering system network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Turla will discover system network configurations before collecting emails and exfiltrating local files.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery** is a discovery technique that would logically precede the collection of emails and exfiltration of files.
       - **T1114.002 - Remote Email Collection** is a collection technique that would follow the discovery of network configurations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Turla will not discover system network configurations before collecting emails and exfiltrating local files.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as discovering network configurations is a common and logical step before collecting emails and exfiltrating files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that Turla will discover system network configurations before collecting emails and exfiltrating local files.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
