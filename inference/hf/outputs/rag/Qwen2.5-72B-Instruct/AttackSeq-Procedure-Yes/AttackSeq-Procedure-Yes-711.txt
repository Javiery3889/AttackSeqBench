### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs were lured through a spear phishing email containing a malicious XLS document, which then led to the execution of macro code to drop the first payload and subsequently download the Crimson RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1204.002 - Malicious File**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of code on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of events described in the question is likely.
     - The sequence involves:
       1. **Spear Phishing Email**: This is a common initial access technique where targeted individuals are sent emails with malicious attachments or links.
       2. **Malicious XLS Document**: The email contains a malicious XLS (Excel) document.
       3. **Macro Code Execution**: The XLS document contains macro code that, when executed, drops the first payload.
       4. **Subsequent Download of Crimson RAT**: The first payload then leads to the download of the Crimson RAT.
     - This sequence aligns well with the T1204.002 - Malicious File technique, which involves tricking users into opening a malicious file that can execute code.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of events described in the question is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described is a common and well-documented attack pattern, especially in targeted attacks against government and high-value targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the sequence of events described is a plausible and common attack pattern.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
