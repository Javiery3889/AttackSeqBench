### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after executing system information discovery commands and returning the results to the C&C server, the malware will attempt communication with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the installed web browsers, including their versions and configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):**
     - This is a common initial step in many attack sequences where the adversary gathers basic information about the system to understand the environment they are operating in.
   - **Browser Information Discovery (T1217):**
     - This technique is often used to gather more specific information about the web browsers installed on the system, which can be useful for further exploitation or to tailor the attack.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - After gathering system and browser information, it is common for malware to communicate this information back to the C&C server. This communication can be done in various ways, including mimicking legitimate traffic to avoid detection.
   - **Beaconing:**
     - Beaconing is a technique where malware periodically sends signals to the C&C server to maintain communication. Mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows is a plausible method to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection by network security systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the common sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is likely that after executing system information discovery commands and returning the results to the C&C server, the malware will attempt communication with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
