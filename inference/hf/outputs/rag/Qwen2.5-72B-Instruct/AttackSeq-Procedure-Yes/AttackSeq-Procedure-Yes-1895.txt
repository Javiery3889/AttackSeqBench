### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor TeamTNT:
     1. Performing reconnaissance by scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
     2. Killing competitor images using `docker rm` commands.
     3. Gaining initial access to the victim's environment by exploiting an exposed Weave Scope service.
     4. Executing a coin miner by downloading it as `/usr/sbin/docker-update` and running it for cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003-Malicious Image:**
     - This technique involves using a malicious image to execute code on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves using the victim's computational resources for cryptocurrency mining.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions scanning for open Docker API endpoints and exploiting an exposed Weave Scope service. This aligns with the initial reconnaissance and gaining access phases of an attack.
   - **Execution of Malicious Image:**
     - The question mentions downloading and running a coin miner as `/usr/sbin/docker-update`. This aligns with the execution of a malicious image (T1204.003).
   - **Compute Hijacking:**
     - The question mentions running a coin miner for cryptocurrency mining, which aligns with the compute hijacking technique (T1496.001).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs. The threat actor performs reconnaissance, gains initial access, and then executes a malicious image to perform compute hijacking for cryptocurrency mining.
