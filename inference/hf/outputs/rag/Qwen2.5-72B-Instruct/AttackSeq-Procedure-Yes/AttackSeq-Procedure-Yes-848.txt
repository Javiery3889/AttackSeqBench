### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that execution of malicious code will occur as part of reaching the lateral movement phase by employing internal spearphishing techniques.
   - The key points are:
     - Persistence is already established.
     - The focus is on lateral movement.
     - The technique in question is internal spearphishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves executing a malicious file, often through user interaction.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves gaining initial access through spearphishing links.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Spearphishing (T1534):**
     - Internal spearphishing is a method used to trick internal users into performing actions that can help an attacker move laterally within the network.
   - **Malicious File Execution (T1204.002):**
     - This technique often involves users opening or executing a file that contains malicious code.
   - **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):**
     - This technique is typically used for initial access, not for lateral movement.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and Lateral Movement:**
     - If persistence is already established, the attacker has a foothold in the network.
   - **Internal Spearphishing for Lateral Movement:**
     - Internal spearphishing can be used to trick internal users into performing actions that help the attacker move to other parts of the network.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:**
     - For internal spearphishing to be effective in lateral movement, it often involves the execution of malicious code. For example, an attacker might send a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment or link that, when opened, executes a payload to gain access to another system.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that internal spearphishing (T1534) is a technique used for lateral movement and often involves the execution of malicious code (T1204.002), it is likely that execution of malicious code will occur as part of reaching the lateral movement phase by employing internal spearphishing techniques.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
