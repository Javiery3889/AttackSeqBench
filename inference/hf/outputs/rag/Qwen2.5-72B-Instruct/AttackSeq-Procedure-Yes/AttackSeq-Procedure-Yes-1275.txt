### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the data collected by Yellow Garuda using the Telegram 'grabber' tool is likely to be exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending collected data back to the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from various information repositories, which aligns with the collection of messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the data is exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.
     - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** This technique supports the idea that data is exfiltrated over the web, which is a common method for sending data to the attacker.
     - **Data from Information Repositories (T1213):** This technique supports the collection of data from Telegram accounts, which is consistent with the question.
     - Storing data in SQLite database and JSON format is a plausible method for organizing and storing exfiltrated data, as it allows for easy retrieval and analysis by the attacker.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the data is not exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that data is collected and exfiltrated.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of the methods described, the most likely answer is that the data is exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
