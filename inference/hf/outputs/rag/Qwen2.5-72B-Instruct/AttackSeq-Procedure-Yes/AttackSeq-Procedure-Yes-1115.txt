### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the LYCEUM group:
     - Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - Execution of DanBot malware using DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the group registered new domains suspected to be part of their command and control (C2) infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.003-Password Spraying:**
     - This technique involves attempting to log in to user accounts by using a small number of commonly used passwords.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:**
     - This technique involves the acquisition of domain names for use in various stages of an attack, including C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The group gained initial access through password spraying, which is a common method for gaining unauthorized access to systems.
   - **Malware Execution:**
     - Once access was gained, the group executed DanBot malware, which uses DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms. This suggests that the malware needs a way to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **C2 Infrastructure:**
     - The use of DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms implies that the malware needs a domain or IP address to communicate with the C2 server.
     - The related TTP T1583.001-Domains indicates that the group is likely to register new domains to use as part of their C2 infrastructure. This is a common practice to maintain control over the compromised systems and to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the group registered new domains to use as part of their C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
