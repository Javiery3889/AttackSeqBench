### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Agrius.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.
     - Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
     - Deploying custom malware, specifically the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
     - Achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
     - Deploying webshells on compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using web shells to maintain access to a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions exploiting public-facing applications for initial access, which is a common initial access technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP is a plausible step. Webshells can be used to execute commands and move laterally within a network.
   - **Deployment of Custom Malware:**
     - Deploying the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a logical next step after gaining initial access and establishing lateral movement. Custom malware is often used to maintain control and perform additional actions.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service aligns with the T1543.003-Windows Service technique, which is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **Additional Webshells:**
     - Deploying webshells on compromised systems aligns with the T1505.003-Web Shell technique, which is used to maintain access and control over the compromised systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with the related TTPs. The steps follow a typical attack pattern where initial access is gained, lateral movement is established, custom malware is deployed, persistence is achieved, and additional webshells are deployed to maintain control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
