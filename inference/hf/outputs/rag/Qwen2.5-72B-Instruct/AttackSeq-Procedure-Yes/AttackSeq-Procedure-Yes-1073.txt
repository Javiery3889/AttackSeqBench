### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through watering hole tactics exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers execute custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers use watering hole tactics and exploit CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Execution of Custom Shellcode:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers execute custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader. This is a common step in post-exploitation to maintain control and execute further commands.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question asks if the attackers are likely to use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.
     - The T1068 technique, Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, is relevant here. It is common for attackers to use tools like PowerShell to exploit vulnerabilities and gain higher privileges.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given that the attackers have already gained initial access and are using a PowerShell loader, it is highly likely that they will attempt to escalate privileges to maintain control and perform further actions on the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
