### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a device driver is used to hook into the Windows firewall to evade detection during network packet inspection. It then asks if the Derusbi server variant is likely to establish command and control (C2) by selecting a random port between 40,000 and 45,000, redirecting appropriate TCP sessions to that port, and sending victim information using a VictimInfoPacket.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic to avoid detection.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communications to avoid detection by network security devices that may be configured to monitor standard ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling:** The use of a device driver to hook into the Windows firewall and evade detection aligns with the concept of traffic signaling. By evading detection, the malware can blend in with normal traffic.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** The selection of a random port between 40,000 and 45,000 for C2 communication is a clear example of using a non-standard port. This helps the malware avoid detection by security devices that may be configured to monitor standard ports.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The described sequence of actions (using a device driver to hook into the firewall, selecting a non-standard port, and redirecting TCP sessions) aligns well with both T1205 and T1571. These techniques are commonly used by sophisticated malware to establish and maintain C2 communications while evading detection.

### Final Answer:
