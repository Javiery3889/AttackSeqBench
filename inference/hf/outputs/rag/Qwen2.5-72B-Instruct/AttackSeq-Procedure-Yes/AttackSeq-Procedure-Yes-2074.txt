### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Whitefly, after using stolen credentials for lateral movement, is likely to configure multiple C&C domains, use encrypted payloads to communicate with infected computers, and download additional tools for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with C&C servers, which can be used to exfiltrate data or receive commands.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and resilience in C&C operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer):**
     - This technique aligns with the initial part of the question where Whitefly uses stolen credentials to move laterally across the network.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS):**
     - This technique suggests that Whitefly might use DNS requests to communicate with C&C servers, which can be a form of encrypted communication.
   - **Command and Control (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels):**
     - This technique indicates that Whitefly might use multiple communication channels, which can include configuring multiple C&C domains and downloading additional tools for command and control.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs strongly suggest that Whitefly is likely to engage in the activities described in the question. Lateral movement is followed by the use of multiple communication channels and DNS for C&C, which can involve configuring multiple C&C domains and using encrypted payloads.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
