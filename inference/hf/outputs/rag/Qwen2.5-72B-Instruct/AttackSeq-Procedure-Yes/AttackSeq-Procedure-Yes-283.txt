### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor "Dropping Elephant."
   - The sequence involves gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails exploiting specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352).
   - After gaining access, the question asks if Dropping Elephant is likely to use a UPX packed backdoor to download PowerShell command line scripts for execution.
   - Finally, it asks if they are likely to employ encoded blobs for defense evasion techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352. This aligns with the T1203 technique, which involves exploiting client-side vulnerabilities.
   - **Use of UPX Packed Backdoor:**
     - UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) is a common tool used to pack executables to make them smaller and harder to analyze. Using a UPX packed backdoor is a plausible step for a threat actor to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Downloading PowerShell Scripts:**
     - The question mentions downloading PowerShell command line scripts for execution. This aligns with the T1059.001 technique, which involves using PowerShell for execution.
   - **Encoded Blobs for Defense Evasion:**
     - Encoded blobs are often used to obfuscate malicious code and evade detection by security tools. This is a common defense evasion technique.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the TTPs provided. The initial access through spear-phishing and exploitation of client-side vulnerabilities (T1203) is followed by the use of a UPX packed backdoor to maintain persistence and evade detection. The backdoor then downloads and executes PowerShell scripts (T1059.001), and finally, encoded blobs are used for further defense evasion.
