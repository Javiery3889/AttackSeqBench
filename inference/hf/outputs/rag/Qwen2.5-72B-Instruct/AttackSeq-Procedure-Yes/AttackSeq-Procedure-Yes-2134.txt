### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that further analysis of the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` will reveal additional malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains, specifically in the context of the threat actor AridViper.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:**
     - This technique involves the acquisition and use of domains for various purposes, including C2.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves the use of multiple communication channels to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves the use of DNS for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1583.001-Domains:**
     - AridViper, like many sophisticated threat actors, is likely to use multiple domains to avoid detection and ensure resilience. The identification of one C2 domain suggests that there may be others.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique indicates that AridViper may use multiple stages of communication, which often involves multiple C2 domains to maintain control over the compromised network.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:**
     - DNS is a common method for C2 communications, and the use of multiple DNS-based C2 domains is a common practice to ensure redundancy and persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the sophisticated nature of AridViper, it is highly likely that further analysis will reveal additional malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
