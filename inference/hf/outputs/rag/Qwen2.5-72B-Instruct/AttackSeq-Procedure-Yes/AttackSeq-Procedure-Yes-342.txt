### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether UNC2452 likely used Discovery techniques (such as querying the registry and identifying running processes) to gain knowledge about systems and the internal network before using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a remote system for command and control purposes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries identifying running processes to gather information about the system and its environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that UNC2452 did use Discovery techniques to gain knowledge about the systems and the internal network before establishing Command and Control communications.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1057-Process Discovery** is a Discovery technique that helps adversaries understand the system's environment, which is a common first step in an attack to gather information.
       - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is a Command and Control technique that is typically used after the adversary has gathered sufficient information to establish a communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that UNC2452 did not use Discovery techniques before establishing Command and Control communications.
     - This is less likely because it is common for adversaries to perform Discovery to understand the target environment before establishing Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical sequence of attack stages, it is more plausible that UNC2452 used Discovery techniques before establishing Command and Control communications.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
