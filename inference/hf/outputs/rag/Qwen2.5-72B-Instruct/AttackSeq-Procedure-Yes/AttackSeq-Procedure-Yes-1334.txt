### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has achieved lateral movement using the `net use` command and confirmed the connection via ping.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) servers using compromised legitimate websites with communication data encrypted by AES and Base64.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using standard encoding schemes (Base64) to obfuscate C2 data.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric encryption (AES) to secure C2 data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This TTP aligns with the use of compromised legitimate websites for C2 communication.
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This TTP aligns with the use of Base64 encoding to obfuscate the data.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This TTP aligns with the use of AES encryption to secure the data.

   Given these TTPs, it is plausible that the RAT malware would use compromised legitimate websites for C2 communication, and it would likely use both AES encryption and Base64 encoding to secure and obfuscate the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the RAT malware will indeed communicate with its C2 servers using compromised legitimate websites with communication data encrypted by AES and Base64.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
