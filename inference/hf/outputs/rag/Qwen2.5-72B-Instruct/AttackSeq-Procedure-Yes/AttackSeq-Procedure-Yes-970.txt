### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Naikon APT group used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase before using HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server.
   - Key points:
     - Evading defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques.
     - Using the Aria-body backdoor for gathering information about active processes.
     - Communicating with the C&C server using HTTP and TCP protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:**
     - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses:**
     - The question mentions evading defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques. This aligns with the Naikon APT group's known tactics for stealth and persistence.
   - **Using Aria-body Backdoor:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor is known to be used by the Naikon APT group for various purposes, including gathering information about active processes. This fits well with the discovery phase of an attack.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The related TTPs mention the use of web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) and protocol tunneling for command and control communication. This aligns with the question's statement about using HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the question's details with the known TTPs of the Naikon APT group and the related TTPs provided, it is likely that the Naikon APT group used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase before utilizing HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
