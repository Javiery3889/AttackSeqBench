### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial Access: Logging into a public-facing system using SSH with stolen credentials and employing VPNs.
     - Persistence: Configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence and GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry.
     - Defense Evasion: Stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to maintain access to a web application.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
     - This technique involves modifying or bypassing MFA to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique involves using stolen web session cookies to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions logging into a public-facing system using SSH with stolen credentials and employing VPNs. This is a common initial access method and aligns with the initial access phase of the attack.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence and GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry. Both WMI persistence (T1086) and crontab entries (T1053) are valid techniques for maintaining persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The question mentions stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA. This aligns with the related TTPs T1550.004 (Web Session Cookie) and T1556.006 (Multi-Factor Authentication).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The initial access methods, persistence techniques, and defense evasion tactics are all consistent with known attack patterns.
