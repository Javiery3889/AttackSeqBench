### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files after being executed via exploitation for client execution in the malicious Word document Agreement.docx.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves using a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Adobe Flash) to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file (e.g., a Word document) that contains or leads to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). This aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:**
     - The malicious Word document (Agreement.docx) is used to execute the exploit, which aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:**
     - The question asks if the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files. This is a plausible scenario because:
       - Malware often uses various techniques to disguise its communication to avoid detection.
       - Disguising communication as common file types like ZIP files is a known tactic to evade network monitoring and security controls.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files after being executed via the exploitation for client execution in the malicious Word document Agreement.docx.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
