### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Machete malware: collecting data (clipboard contents, screenshots, keystrokes), and then exfiltrating the data to remote servers.
   - The specific question is whether the malware used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers before exfiltrating the data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a communication channel used by the malware to communicate with its C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which aligns with the question's mention of stealing clipboard contents.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication, such as FTP or HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers before exfiltrating the data.
     - The T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) implies that the data is exfiltrated over a C2 channel, which is typically a secure and encrypted communication channel.
     - The T1048.003 technique (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol) suggests that the data is exfiltrated over unencrypted protocols like FTP or HTTP, but it does not specify that these protocols are used for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware did not use FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers before exfiltrating the data.
     - Given that T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is a more secure and typical method for C2 communication, it is more likely that the malware used a C2 channel for communication with its C2 servers.
     - The T1048.003 technique (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol) is more likely to be used for the actual exfiltration of data, not for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware used a C2 channel for communication with its C2 servers and then exfiltrated the data over unencrypted protocols like FTP or HTTP.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
