### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlueBravo is likely to gather victim system information after establishing persistence through registry run keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the username, computer name, Windows version, and list of running processes.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves adversaries establishing persistence by creating registry run keys or placing files in the startup folder to ensure their malware runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The question states that BlueBravo has already established persistence using registry run keys (T1547.001).
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - The related TTPs include T1082, which is specifically about gathering system information. This technique is commonly used after gaining initial access and establishing persistence to understand the environment and plan further actions.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that BlueBravo has established persistence, it is highly likely that they would proceed to gather system information to better understand the victim's environment and plan their next steps. This aligns with the T1082 technique, which is part of the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
