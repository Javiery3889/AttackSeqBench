### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to use tools like mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping by using DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller after gaining higher-level permissions via compromised MSP credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts (Persistence and Privilege Escalation):** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts, such as domain accounts, to maintain access and escalate privileges within a network.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping (Credential Access):** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, often using tools like mimikatz or PwDump.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Compromised MSP Credentials and Privilege Escalation:**
     - APT10 is known to use compromised credentials, particularly those of Managed Service Providers (MSPs), to gain initial access and then escalate privileges to domain administrator level. This aligns with the T1078.002 technique.
   - **Step 2: OS Credential Dumping:**
     - Once APT10 has elevated privileges, it is common for them to use tools like mimikatz or PwDump to dump credentials from the operating system. This is a well-documented technique (T1003) used to gain additional access and maintain persistence.
   - **Step 3: DLL Load Order Hijacking:**
     - DLL load order hijacking is a method used to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate application. While this technique can be used for various purposes, including persistence and privilege escalation, it is not typically the primary method for OS credential dumping. However, it can be used in conjunction with credential dumping tools to ensure they are executed with the necessary permissions.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that APT10 has already gained domain administrator privileges, they are likely to use tools like mimikatz or PwDump directly to dump credentials from the domain controller. While DLL load order hijacking can be a part of the attack, it is not a necessary step for OS credential dumping in this context.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
