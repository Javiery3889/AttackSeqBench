### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to export certificates and associated private keys from the system store for credential access after achieving persistence with a scheduled task and a service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique involves stealing private keys from the system store, which is a method used for credential access.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Execution:**
     - The question mentions that CosmicDuke has achieved persistence using a scheduled task and a service. This aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique, which is used for both persistence and execution.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to export certificates and associated private keys from the system store. This aligns with the T1552.004-Private Keys technique, which is used for credential access.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The question also mentions searching for files on network and hard drives based on specific patterns. However, this is not directly related to the T1552.004-Private Keys technique, which focuses on credential access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that CosmicDuke has already achieved persistence and execution using scheduled tasks, it is plausible that the next step in the attack sequence could be to gain credential access by exporting private keys. This aligns with the T1552.004-Private Keys technique.
   - The search for files on network and hard drives is a separate step that is not directly related to the credential access technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
