### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors would use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques to gain knowledge about systems and the internal network before employing techniques to gain elevated permissions (Privilege Escalation).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1007 - System Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating system services to understand the services running on a system.
   - **T1012 - Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, system configurations, and user information.
   - **T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting system vulnerabilities to gain higher levels of access or privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Discovery and Query Registry (T1007 and T1012):** These techniques are part of the Discovery tactic. They are typically used to gather information about the system and network, which is crucial for the threat actors to understand the environment they are operating in.
   - **Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068):** This technique is part of the Privilege Escalation tactic. It is used to gain higher levels of access or privileges, which is often a subsequent step after the threat actors have gathered sufficient information about the system and network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **Discovery Phase:** Threat actors first need to understand the environment they are in. This involves using techniques like System Service Discovery (T1007) and Query Registry (T1012) to gather information about the system and network.
     - **Privilege Escalation Phase:** Once the threat actors have a good understanding of the environment, they can then use techniques like Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068) to gain higher levels of access.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that threat actors would use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques before attempting Privilege Escalation. This is because the information gathered during the Discovery phase is essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities and planning the next steps in the attack.
