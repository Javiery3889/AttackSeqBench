### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents using the remote template technique.
   - It then mentions exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool.
   - Finally, it asks if the attackers will create a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents employing the remote template technique is a common method for initial access. This technique is well-documented and aligns with the initial stages of many cyber-attacks.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool is a known technique used by advanced threat actors. The RoyalRoad tool is specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Equation Editor, which can be used to execute arbitrary code and initiate a multi-stage infection chain.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' is a common persistence technique. The technique T1053.005 (Scheduled Task) is listed in the related TTPs, which confirms that this is a plausible step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with known attack patterns.
   - Each step in the sequence (initial access, exploitation, and persistence) is supported by the related TTPs and is a plausible sequence of actions for an advanced threat actor.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
