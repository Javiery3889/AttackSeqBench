### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence starts with using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
   - The question then asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to use the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe` and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by running malicious code in the context of a legitimate process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploit:**
     - Tropic Trooper uses Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Use of FakeRun Loader:**
     - The FakeRun loader is a known tool used by Tropic Trooper to launch `dllhost.exe`. This is a step to establish a foothold and potentially evade detection.
   - **Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - After launching `dllhost.exe`, Tropic Trooper is likely to use dynamic-link library (DLL) injection to inject a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process. This aligns with the related TTPs provided, which emphasize the use of DLL injection for both privilege escalation and defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Tropic Trooper would use the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe` and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process to facilitate their attack.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
