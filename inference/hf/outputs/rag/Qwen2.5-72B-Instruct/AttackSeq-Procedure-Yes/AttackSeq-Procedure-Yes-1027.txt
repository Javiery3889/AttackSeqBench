### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Gamaredon group will use malware to take screenshots every minute after listing interesting files for future exfiltration, and then use HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This indicates that the group uses HTTP and HTTPS for C2.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This suggests that the group automates the exfiltration of files.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This indicates that the group exfiltrates data over the same channel used for C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):** The group lists interesting files for future exfiltration, which aligns with automated exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** The group uses the same C2 channel for exfiltration, which is consistent with using HTTP and HTTPS for both C2 and exfiltration.
   - **Taking Screenshots Every Minute:** This is not mentioned in the related TTPs. While taking screenshots can be a part of an attack, it is not a common or necessary step in the sequence described by the related TTPs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs focus on automated exfiltration and using HTTP/HTTPS for C2 and exfiltration. Taking screenshots every minute is not a typical or necessary step in this sequence.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for C2.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
