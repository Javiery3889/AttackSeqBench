### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor is likely to gather system information (host-name, computer-name, and public IP) during the Discovery phase before sending the collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the host-name, computer-name, and other system-specific details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will gather system information during the Discovery phase and then send the collected data to the C&C domain.
     - The related TTPs (T1016 and T1082) directly support this sequence. T1016 is about gathering network configuration information, and T1082 is about gathering system information, both of which are consistent with the question's description.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will not gather system information during the Discovery phase before sending data to the C&C domain.
     - This choice is not supported by the related TTPs, as both T1016 and T1082 indicate that gathering system information is a common and expected behavior during the Discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Aria-body backdoor will gather system information during the Discovery phase before sending the collected data to the C&C domain.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
