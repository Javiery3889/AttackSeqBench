### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by GreyEnergy operators: reconnaissance, targeting ICS control workstations, extracting data, taking screenshots, and performing keylogging.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that these operators will develop and deploy a modular malware framework tailored for espionage and reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is used to obtain credentials by capturing keystrokes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs confirm that keylogging is a significant part of the attack sequence, which aligns with the reconnaissance and data extraction activities described in the question.
   - Keylogging is a common technique used in espionage and reconnaissance to gather sensitive information and credentials.
   - Given that GreyEnergy operators have already demonstrated sophisticated capabilities in reconnaissance and data collection, it is reasonable to infer that they would continue to develop and deploy advanced malware to further their objectives.
   - A modular malware framework allows for flexibility and adaptability, which are crucial for sustained espionage and reconnaissance activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that GreyEnergy operators will develop and deploy a modular malware framework tailored for espionage and reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
