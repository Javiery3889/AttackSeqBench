### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether GreyEnergy, after using a modular malware framework during resource development, is likely to proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a common step in the collection phase of an attack. It aligns with the idea of gathering host information.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about network security appliances, which is part of the reconnaissance phase. It helps the attacker understand the network environment and identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - GreyEnergy is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, particularly in the ICS (Industrial Control Systems) sector. Using a modular malware framework allows them to adapt and extend their capabilities dynamically. After gaining initial access and deploying the modular malware, it is highly likely that they would proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers to gather host information. This aligns with the T1005 technique (Data from Local System) and the broader reconnaissance efforts described by T1590.006 (Network Security Appliances).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy would not proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering. However, given the nature of GreyEnergy's operations and the related TTPs, this is less likely. Reconnaissance and data collection are critical steps in their attack lifecycle.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the known behavior of GreyEnergy, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that they would indeed proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
