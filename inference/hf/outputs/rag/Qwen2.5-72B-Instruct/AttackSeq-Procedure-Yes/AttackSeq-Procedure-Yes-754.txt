### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious XLS attachment uses a VB macro to download and execute a malicious MSI package.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1218.007-Msiexec (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves using the `msiexec` command to install or execute a malicious MSI package. This is consistent with the question's description of the VB macro downloading and executing an MSI package.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (Persistence):** This technique involves creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to achieve persistence. This is relevant to the question's focus on achieving persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Persistence):** This is a broader category that includes various methods of achieving persistence at boot or logon, including the use of LNK files in the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs suggest that achieving persistence is a common goal for malware. Specifically, T1547.001 and T1547 both indicate that creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries (including LNK files) is a common method for achieving persistence.
     - Given that the MSI package is being executed, it is plausible that it could be configured to install an LNK file in the startup folder to ensure it runs at system startup.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the MSI package does not attempt to achieve persistence, which is less likely given the context of the attack. Malware often seeks to maintain a foothold on the system, and persistence is a key aspect of this.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of malware, it is more likely that the MSI package will attempt to achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
