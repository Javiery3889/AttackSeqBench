### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021:
     - They used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
     - They gathered output files during the Discovery phase.
     - The question asks if it is likely that they would then access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to access and control remote systems, often through administrative shares.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - SharpHound and PowerSploit are commonly used for reconnaissance to gather information about the network and systems.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The output files from these tools would provide detailed information about the network topology, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Lateral Movement Phase:**
     - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
       - Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB is a common method for lateral movement.
     - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
       - Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers aligns with the technique of transferring tools to remote systems to facilitate further compromise.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
