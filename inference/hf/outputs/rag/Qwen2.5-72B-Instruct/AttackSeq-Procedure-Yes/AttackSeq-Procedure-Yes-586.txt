### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether adversaries who use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase would likely identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase to support the infrastructure linked with attacks like the Kinsing malware campaign.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning large blocks of IP addresses to identify potential targets, such as compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves using various methods to obscure the infrastructure used for command and control, such as using domain fronting or fast flux.
   - **Resource Development, Technique: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:** This technique involves compromising legitimate infrastructure to use it for malicious purposes, such as hosting malware or command and control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Adversaries use DOCKERGEDDON to scan netblocks and identify compromised Docker APIs. This is a common initial step to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Once the adversaries have identified compromised Docker APIs, they would likely look for ways to leverage these compromised resources to support their infrastructure.
     - Compromising infrastructure (T1584) is a logical next step, where they might use the identified compromised Docker APIs to host their malware or command and control servers.
   - **Hide Infrastructure (T1665):**
     - To avoid detection, adversaries often use techniques to hide their infrastructure. One common method is to use domains that resolve to the same IP address, which can make it harder to trace back to the actual malicious infrastructure.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that after identifying compromised Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase, adversaries would use these compromised resources to support their infrastructure in the Resource Development phase. They would likely use techniques to hide this infrastructure, such as using domains that resolve to the same IP address.
