### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion before targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves the use of digital certificates for reconnaissance purposes, which is not directly relevant to the question.
   - **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique involves signing malware or backdoors with digital certificates to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves using keyloggers to capture credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT will use sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion before targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access.
     - **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique aligns with the use of digital certificates to sign backdoors, which is a sophisticated capability for defense evasion.
     - **Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique aligns with the use of keyloggers to capture credentials, which is a common method for credential access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT will not use these sophisticated capabilities.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is more likely that Darkhotel APT would use these capabilities to enhance their attack and evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sophisticated nature of the Darkhotel APT, it is likely that they will use these capabilities to enhance their attack and evade detection before targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
