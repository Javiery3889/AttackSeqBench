### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Shamoon malware:
     - It entrenches itself as a service for persistence.
     - It executes the entrenched file, resulting in a dropped driver for destructive operations.
     - It asks whether Shamoon will eventually overwrite the disk's boot records to prevent access to the targeted file system and target both user and system data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:**
     - This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data to disrupt the availability of information and systems.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe:**
     - This technique involves overwriting the disk's boot records and other critical structures to render the disk unusable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Shamoon will indeed overwrite the disk's boot records and target both user and system data.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1485-Data Destruction** aligns with the destruction of both user and system data.
       - **T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe** aligns with overwriting the disk's boot records to prevent access to the file system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Shamoon will not overwrite the disk's boot records or target both user and system data.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate that Shamoon is capable of and likely to perform these actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that Shamoon will indeed overwrite the disk's boot records and target both user and system data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
