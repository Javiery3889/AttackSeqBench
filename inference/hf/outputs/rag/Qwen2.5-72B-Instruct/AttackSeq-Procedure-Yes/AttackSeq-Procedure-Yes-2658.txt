### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug, after collecting data from various sources, is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using a custom protocol at a layer other than the application layer (e.g., TCP) to communicate with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Korplug does use a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports for C&C communication and then exfiltrates data via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.
     - This aligns with the T1095 technique, which describes the use of a non-standard protocol for C&C communication.
     - It also aligns with the T1041 technique, which describes exfiltration over the same C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Korplug does not use a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports for C&C communication and does not exfiltrate data via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.
     - This does not align with the T1095 and T1041 techniques, which describe the use of a custom protocol and exfiltration over the C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that Korplug does use a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports for C&C communication and exfiltrates data via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
