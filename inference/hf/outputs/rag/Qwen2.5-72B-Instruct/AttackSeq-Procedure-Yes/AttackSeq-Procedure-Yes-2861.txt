### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CCleaner binary will execute malicious code by calling a specific function (`CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`) and decrypting a malicious payload after being downloaded as part of a compromised CCleaner 5.33 installation package signed with a valid digital certificate.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
     - This technique involves using a valid digital certificate to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate to security systems and users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the CCleaner binary will indeed execute malicious code as described.
     - The use of a valid digital certificate (T1553.002-Code Signing) is a common tactic in sophisticated attacks to bypass security measures.
     - The specific function call (`CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`) and the decryption of the malicious payload are consistent with the behavior of a compromised software installation.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the CCleaner binary will not execute malicious code as described.
     - This would be unlikely given the context of a compromised installation package signed with a valid digital certificate, which is a known method for delivering and executing malicious code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the CCleaner binary will execute malicious code by calling the specified function and decrypting the payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
