### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the file-stealer module of the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server after stealing Google Chrome credentials and other data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files with specific extensions.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is a prerequisite for collecting specific files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The backdoor has already stolen credentials from the web browser (T1555.003). It is common for malware to perform additional data collection (T1005) after initial credential theft. The file-stealer module would likely use file and directory discovery (T1083) to identify and collect files with specific extensions, which are then uploaded to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module would not perform additional data collection after stealing credentials. However, this is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware is capable of and likely to perform such actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware, the most plausible sequence is that the file-stealer module will indeed iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
