### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites where attackers have posted encoded IP addresses or domain names.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1102.001 - Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves using a pre-determined location on the internet (such as a web service, microblog, or social networking site) to retrieve the C2 server address. The malware checks this location for updates or new C2 server information.
   - **T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel with the C2 server, allowing the malware to send data to and receive commands from the server.
   - **T1102 - Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services (such as social media, microblogs, or other web applications) to host C2 infrastructure or to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This aligns with the T1102.001 - Dead Drop Resolver technique, where the malware retrieves the C2 server address from a pre-determined location on the internet, such as a microblog or social networking site.
     - It also aligns with the T1102 - Web Service technique, which involves using legitimate web services to host C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This does not align with the T1102.001 - Dead Drop Resolver or T1102 - Web Service techniques, as it suggests that the malware does not use these methods to retrieve the C2 server address.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites where attackers have posted encoded IP addresses or domain names.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
