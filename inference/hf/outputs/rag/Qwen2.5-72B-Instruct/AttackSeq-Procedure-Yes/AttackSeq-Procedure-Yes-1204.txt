### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where 'Energetic Bear' compromises a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack, specifically a watering hole attack (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that 'Energetic Bear' would harvest Microsoft SMB credentials through a redirected image URL to a file protocol as part of their credential access strategy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website that the target is likely to visit, often through a watering hole attack.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials through various means, such as phishing or credential harvesting.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending targeted emails with links that lead to credential harvesting or malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise):** The scenario starts with a watering hole attack, which is a common initial access technique used by 'Energetic Bear'.
   - **Credential Access (T1589.001-Credentials):** The question asks about harvesting credentials, which is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access.
   - **Spearphishing Link (T1598.003):** This technique is related to credential harvesting but typically involves email-based attacks rather than web-based redirections.

   - **Redirected Image URL to a File Protocol:**
     - Redirecting an image URL to a file protocol (e.g., `file://`) is an unusual and specific method for credential harvesting.
     - While 'Energetic Bear' is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, this specific method is not a common or well-documented technique in their known TTPs.
     - More common methods for credential harvesting include phishing emails, web-based forms, and other more straightforward techniques.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While 'Energetic Bear' is capable of sophisticated attacks and might use various methods to harvest credentials, the specific method of redirecting an image URL to a file protocol is not a typical or well-documented technique in their known TTPs.
   - The more common and documented methods for credential harvesting, such as spearphishing links and web-based forms, are more likely to be used.

### Final Answer: B: No
