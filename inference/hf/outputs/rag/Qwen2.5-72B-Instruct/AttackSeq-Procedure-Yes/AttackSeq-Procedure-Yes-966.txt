### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage, after gathering detailed system and network information through the Aria-body backdoor during the Discovery tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves the use of non-standard ports for C2 communications to avoid detection by network security devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications.
     - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols directly supports this choice, as it indicates the use of web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Naikon APT group is not likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications.
     - While T1571-Non-Standard Port indicates the use of non-standard ports, it does not necessarily preclude the use of HTTP and TCP protocols. Non-standard ports can still be used with HTTP and TCP.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols explicitly states that web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) are used for C2 communications.
   - The use of non-standard ports (T1571) does not contradict the use of HTTP and TCP; it can be an additional layer to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the use of HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
