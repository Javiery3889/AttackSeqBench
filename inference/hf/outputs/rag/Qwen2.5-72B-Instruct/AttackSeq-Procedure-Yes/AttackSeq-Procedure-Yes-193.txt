### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will acquire domains and servers from specific providers during the Resource Development phase before gaining Initial Access by exploiting public-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - This phase involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, such as acquiring domains and servers, to support the attack.
     - It is common for threat actors to use legitimate providers to acquire this infrastructure to avoid detection and to appear legitimate.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The technique T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) is a common method for gaining initial access.
     - FamousSparrow is known to exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Acquiring Infrastructure:**
     - It is highly likely that FamousSparrow would acquire domains and servers from providers such as Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY during the Resource Development phase. This is a standard practice to ensure they have the necessary infrastructure to launch their attacks.
   - **Exploiting Public-Facing Applications:**
     - Once the infrastructure is in place, FamousSparrow would then use it to exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to the target network.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practices in the Resource Development phase and the known techniques of FamousSparrow, it is highly likely that they would follow this sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
