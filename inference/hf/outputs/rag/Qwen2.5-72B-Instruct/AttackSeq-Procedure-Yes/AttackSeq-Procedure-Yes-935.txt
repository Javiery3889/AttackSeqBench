### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a backdoor program will gather host information after performing evasion techniques and before utilizing DNS tunneling for communication with the C2 server and executing commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking for virtual machines, sandboxes, and debugging environments to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evasion Techniques (T1497.001-System Checks):** The backdoor program first performs evasion techniques to ensure it is not running in a virtualized or monitored environment. This is a common first step to avoid detection and analysis.
   - **Gathering Host Information:** After confirming that the environment is safe, it is logical for the backdoor to gather host information. This information can be used to tailor the attack, understand the victim's environment, and make informed decisions about subsequent actions.
   - **DNS Tunneling (T1071.004-DNS):** Once the host information is gathered, the backdoor can use DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server. This method is often used to exfiltrate data and receive commands in a stealthy manner.
   - **Executing Commands:** Finally, the backdoor will execute commands received from the C2 server, which may include further data exfiltration, lateral movement, or other malicious activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the related techniques, it is likely that the backdoor program will gather host information before utilizing DNS tunneling for communication with the C2 server and executing commands.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
