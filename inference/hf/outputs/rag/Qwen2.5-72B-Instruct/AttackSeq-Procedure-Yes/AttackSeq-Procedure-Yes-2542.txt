### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over an application layer protocol after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, and whether it will exfiltrate data through the same C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique describes the process where an adversary exfiltrates data from a victim network by sending it over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:**
     - These are initial steps in the attack sequence where the adversary gathers information about the system and captures the screen. These actions are typically performed to understand the environment and gather sensitive data.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:**
     - After gathering the necessary information, the backdoor would need to communicate with the C2 server to send the collected data. This communication is often done over an application layer protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS).
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - The related TTP (T1041) confirms that exfiltration can occur over the same C2 channel used for communication. This is a common practice to avoid detection and maintain a low profile.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTP (T1041) and the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over an application layer protocol and exfiltrate data through the same C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
