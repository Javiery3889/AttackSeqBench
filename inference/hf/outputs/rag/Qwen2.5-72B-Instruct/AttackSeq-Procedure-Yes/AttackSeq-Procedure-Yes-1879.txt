### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FIN13:
     - Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.
     - Potentially employing network sniffing to obtain credentials.
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to identify and extract sensitive information, such as credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique is specifically used to capture credentials from network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
     - This technique involves altering the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation:**
     - This is a common technique for credential access, where the threat actor uses a trojanized application to capture credentials.
   - **Employing network sniffing to obtain credentials:**
     - The related TTPs (T1040-Network Sniffing) indicate that network sniffing is a valid technique for credential access and discovery. This aligns with the question's description.
   - **Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance:**
     - This is a common step in the discovery phase, where the threat actor uses various tools to gather information about the network and host configurations.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. FIN13 is likely to use network sniffing to obtain credentials after using trojanized KeePass binaries, and then proceed with internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
