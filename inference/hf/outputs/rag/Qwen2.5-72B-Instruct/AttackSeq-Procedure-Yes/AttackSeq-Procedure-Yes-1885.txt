### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor group FIN13.
   - The sequence starts with exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE (which establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports) before using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using web shells to maintain access to a compromised system. Web shells are often used for initial access and can be used to execute commands, upload/download files, and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the compromised system. This can include using different protocols and methods to maintain control and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware. This aligns with the T1505.003-Web Shell technique, which is used for initial access and maintaining persistence.
   - **Passive Backdoors (BLUEAGAVE):**
     - BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports. This can be used to listen for incoming HTTP requests and execute commands. This technique is often used to maintain a low-profile presence on the compromised system.
   - **Persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries:**
     - After establishing initial access and possibly using a passive backdoor, it is common for threat actors to use additional methods to establish persistence. SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are tools that can be used to maintain long-term access to the system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access using web shells, it is reasonable for FIN13 to use a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE to maintain a low-profile presence. This can then be followed by using more robust persistence mechanisms like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to ensure long-term access.
