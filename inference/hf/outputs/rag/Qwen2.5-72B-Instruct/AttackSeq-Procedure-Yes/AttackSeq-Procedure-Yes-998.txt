### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data to an IP address they control after deploying Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not typically used for command and control (C2) and is unencrypted.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for command and control or data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** SmartFTP Client is a file transfer tool that can be used to exfiltrate data over an unencrypted protocol, which aligns with this technique.
       - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** SmartFTP Client is a file transfer protocol, which fits this technique.
       - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** The use of different tools (Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and SmartFTP for exfiltration) suggests a multi-stage approach, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attacker would not use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which suggest the use of file transfer protocols and multi-stage channels for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the reasoning provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
