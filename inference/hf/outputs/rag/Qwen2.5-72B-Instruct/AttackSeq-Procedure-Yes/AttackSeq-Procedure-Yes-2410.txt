### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious macro downloads and executes a second-stage downloader, which then fetches an encrypted third-stage payload.
   - The question then asks if Lokibot is likely to escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe before employing process hollowing to bypass User Account Control (UAC).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves methods to bypass UAC, which is a security feature in Windows that prevents unauthorized changes to the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming the process to execute the malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique is listed again, emphasizing the use of process hollowing for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Injection into Notepad.exe**: While DLL injection is a common technique used by malware to execute code in the context of another process, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs. Additionally, Notepad.exe is not typically a high-privilege process, so injecting a DLL into it would not directly escalate privileges.
   - **Process Hollowing to Bypass UAC**: The related TTPs clearly mention process hollowing as a technique for both defense evasion and privilege escalation. Process hollowing can be used to bypass UAC by creating a new process with elevated privileges and injecting malicious code into it.
   - **Sequence of Actions**: The question asks if Lokibot is likely to perform these actions in the described sequence. Given that process hollowing is a more direct and effective method for privilege escalation and bypassing UAC, it is more plausible that Lokibot would use process hollowing directly rather than injecting a DLL into Notepad.exe first.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described, it is more likely that Lokibot would use process hollowing to bypass UAC directly rather than injecting a DLL into Notepad.exe first.

**Final Answer: B: No**
