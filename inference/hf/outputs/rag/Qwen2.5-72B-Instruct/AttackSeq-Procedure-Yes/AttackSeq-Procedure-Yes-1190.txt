### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the RMS executable, after being used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, attempted to communicate with a C2 server in Germany using application layer protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This sub-technique specifically involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-standard protocols (e.g., raw sockets, custom protocols) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions "application layer protocols," which aligns with the T1071 and T1071.001 techniques.
   - The T1095 technique (Non-Application Layer Protocol) is not relevant to the question since it does not involve standard application layer protocols.
   - Given that the RMS tool was used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, it is plausible that the attackers would use standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server to maintain stealth and evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that the RMS executable did attempt to communicate with a C2 server using application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
