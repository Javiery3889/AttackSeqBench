### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with an initial Flash zero-day exploit that gains arbitrary read/write memory capabilities to execute a second stage shellcode.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain control over a compromised system. This often includes downloading additional payloads and establishing C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploit (T1203):**
     - The initial Flash zero-day exploit gains arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, which is a common first step in many attacks. This allows the attacker to execute a second stage shellcode.
   - **Second Stage Shellcode:**
     - The second stage shellcode is typically used to perform more complex tasks, such as downloading additional payloads and establishing C2 communication.
   - **Downloading Final Payload (FinSpy):**
     - It is common for second stage shellcode to download the final payload, which in this case is FinSpy. This is a logical next step to maintain persistence and gain further control over the compromised system.
   - **Establishing C2 Communication (T1104):**
     - Establishing communication with C2 servers is a crucial step in maintaining control over the compromised system. This is often done after the final payload is downloaded and executed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
