### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, the threat actor SWEED will proceed to collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a common post-exploitation activity.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack, which is a common defense evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - The threat actor SWEED has already exploited CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access and execute code on the target system.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion):**
     - After gaining access, it is common for threat actors to employ defense evasion techniques to avoid detection. Deleting the original file (e.g., the exploit file) is a typical method to remove traces of the attack.
   - **Collection (T1005-Data from Local System):**
     - Once the threat actor has established a foothold and evaded defenses, the next logical step is to collect data from the local system. This is a common post-exploitation activity to gather sensitive information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, it is highly likely that after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and employing defense evasion techniques, the threat actor SWEED will proceed to collect data from the local system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
