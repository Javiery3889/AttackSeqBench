### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control (C2) before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.
   - The sequence of actions described includes:
     - Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives.
     - Archiving the data locally or remotely.
     - Using proxies for C2.
     - Exfiltrating the data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the collection of sensitive data from network shared drives.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over alternative protocols, which could include web services and tools like web shells and JSP tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (T1005):**
     - The question mentions collecting sensitive data from network shared drives, which aligns with T1005.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001):**
     - The question asks about using proxies for C2, and T1071.001 involves using web protocols for C2. Proxies can be used to route traffic through web protocols, which is a common technique to obfuscate C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration (T1048):**
     - The question mentions exfiltrating data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools, which aligns with T1048, as it involves exfiltration over alternative protocols.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that FIN13 would use proxies for C2 before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools. This aligns with the use of web protocols for C2 and exfiltration over alternative protocols.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
