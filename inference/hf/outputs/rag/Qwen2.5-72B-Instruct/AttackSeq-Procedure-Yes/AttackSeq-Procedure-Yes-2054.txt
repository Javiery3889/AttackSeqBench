### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Charming Kitten uses social engineering to send emails and redirect victims to decoy websites for initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten developed and used fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram's official website, hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation, for resource development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1585.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves the use of email accounts to send phishing emails or other malicious communications.

   - **T1584.006-Web Services:** This technique involves the use of web services to host malicious content, such as fake websites or phishing pages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Email Accounts (T1585.002):** The question mentions that Charming Kitten uses socially engineered emails to redirect victims to decoy websites. This aligns with the use of email accounts for initial access.
   - **Social Media Accounts (T1585.001):** The question does not explicitly mention the use of social media accounts, but it is possible that Charming Kitten could use social media to spread the initial phishing emails or to gather information about potential victims.
   - **Web Services (T1584.006):** The question specifically mentions the development and use of fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram's official website. This aligns with the use of web services to host these fake websites.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Charming Kitten uses social engineering to send emails and redirect victims to decoy websites. The related TTPs, especially T1584.006-Web Services, support the idea that Charming Kitten would develop and use fake websites for resource development.
   - The use of servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation is a plausible detail, as threat actors often use various hosting services to host their malicious content.
