### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TDrop2 malware would use process hollowing to evade detection after gaining initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables, and then engage in discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This indicates that the initial access is gained through phishing, which aligns with the spear-phishing emails mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique is used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection, which is a common method for malware to remain undetected.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique can also be used for privilege escalation, which is another common goal of malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that TDrop2 would indeed use process hollowing to evade detection after gaining initial access.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1566-Phishing** for initial access.
       - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** for defense evasion.
       - After evading detection, the malware would likely engage in discovery activities to gather system information and network views.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TDrop2 would not use process hollowing to evade detection.
     - This choice is less likely because:
       - Process hollowing is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.
       - The related TTPs specifically mention process hollowing in the context of defense evasion and privilege escalation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that TDrop2 would use process hollowing to evade detection after gaining initial access via spear-phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
