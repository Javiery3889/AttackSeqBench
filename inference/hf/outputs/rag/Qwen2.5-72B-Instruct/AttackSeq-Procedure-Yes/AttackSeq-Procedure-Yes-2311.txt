### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will use custom-built malware to exfiltrate processed files to cloud storage services after compressing, encrypting, and staging the data, and after collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
     - This technique describes the use of cloud storage services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will use custom-built malware to exfiltrate the processed files to cloud storage services.
     - The related TTP (T1567.002) confirms that exfiltration to cloud storage is a known technique.
     - Custom-built malware can be used to automate the exfiltration process, making it a plausible method for an adversary to use.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will not use custom-built malware to exfiltrate the processed files to cloud storage services.
     - While it is possible that an adversary might use other methods, the related TTP (T1567.002) indicates that exfiltration to cloud storage is a common and effective method.
     - Given the context of the question, which includes compressing, encrypting, and staging data, using custom-built malware to automate the exfiltration process is a logical next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the adversary will use custom-built malware to exfiltrate the processed files to cloud storage services.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
