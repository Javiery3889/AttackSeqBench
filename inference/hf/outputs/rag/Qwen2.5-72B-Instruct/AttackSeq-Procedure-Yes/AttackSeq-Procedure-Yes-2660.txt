### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda's Korplug variant is likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages after performing data discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can include custom protocols.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving data using custom methods before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug variant uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** indicates that data can be exfiltrated over a custom protocol.
       - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method** indicates that data can be compressed and encrypted before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug variant does not use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as both T1041 and T1560.003 suggest the use of custom methods for exfiltration and data compression/encryption.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
