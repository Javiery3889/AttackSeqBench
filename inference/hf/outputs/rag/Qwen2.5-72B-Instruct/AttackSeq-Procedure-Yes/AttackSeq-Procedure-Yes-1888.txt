### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13, after obtaining credentials using techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries, is likely to gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process:** This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain or maintain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obtaining Credentials:**
     - The question mentions that FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS (T1003.001) and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials. This aligns with the related TTPs.
   - **Gathering Information on Services:**
     - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to gather information on services using system service discovery. This is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to understand the environment better before moving laterally.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells for lateral movement. WMI is a common technique for lateral movement (T1047), and custom web shells can be used to maintain access and execute commands remotely.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Step 1:** FIN13 obtains credentials using LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries.
     - **Step 2:** FIN13 gathers information on services using system service discovery to understand the network and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
     - **Step 3:** FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells to move laterally in the network.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. After obtaining credentials, it is logical for an attacker to gather more information about the environment to plan and execute lateral movement effectively.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
