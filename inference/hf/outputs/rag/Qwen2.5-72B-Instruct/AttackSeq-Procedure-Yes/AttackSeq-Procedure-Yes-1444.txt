### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a new variant of the Taidoor malware, after avoiding detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version, is likely to communicate with specific command-and-control (C2) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain a connection with the C2 server. This can include initial contact, followed by more sophisticated communication methods.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection by network security systems.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the malware and the C2 server, allowing for both commands to be sent to the malware and data to be exfiltrated from the infected system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the TTPs, it is plausible that the new Taidoor variant would communicate with the specified C2 servers. The use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware suggests that the malware is designed to avoid detection and maintain communication with its C2 infrastructure.
     - The T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique indicates that the malware might use multiple stages to establish and maintain communication, which aligns with the idea of using specific C2 servers.
     - The T1571-Non-Standard Port technique suggests that the malware might use non-standard ports to communicate, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.
     - The T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication technique indicates that the malware is capable of maintaining a two-way communication channel, which is essential for receiving commands and exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the new Taidoor variant does not communicate with the specified C2 servers. However, given the TTPs and the nature of the malware, this is less likely. The use of a downloader and decryption suggests that the malware is designed to maintain communication with its C2 infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the nature of the Taidoor malware, the most plausible answer is that the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the specified C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
