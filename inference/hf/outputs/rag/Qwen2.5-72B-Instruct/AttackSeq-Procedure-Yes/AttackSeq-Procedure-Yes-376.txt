### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely to observe BBSRAT exfiltrating additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server after it has established command and control communication and exfiltrated initial data about the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is consistent with the initial step of BBSRAT establishing command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. This is relevant to the question of whether BBSRAT will exfiltrate additional data after the initial exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that BBSRAT will exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is plausible. After establishing command and control communication and exfiltrating initial data, it is common for malware to continue exfiltrating additional data, especially if the data is compressed and encrypted to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that BBSRAT will not exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs. The technique T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) indicates that malware often continues to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware, the most plausible answer is that BBSRAT will exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
