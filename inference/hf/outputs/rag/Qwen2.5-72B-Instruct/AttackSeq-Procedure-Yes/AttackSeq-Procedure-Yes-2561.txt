### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware, after establishing persistent communication with C&C servers via IRC, is likely to gather information about the infected host before maintaining the IRC channel for receiving commands and orchestrating operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like IRC) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as processor details and installed monitoring tools, to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Establishing C&C Communication (T1071):** The malware first needs to establish a communication channel with the C&C server. This is a critical first step to receive commands and orchestrate operations.
     - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** Once the communication channel is established, the malware can then gather information about the infected host. This information is useful for the attackers to understand the environment and plan their next steps, such as exfiltrating data or deploying additional malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is more plausible that the malware would establish the IRC channel first (T1071) and then gather system information (T1082).

**Final Answer: B: No**
