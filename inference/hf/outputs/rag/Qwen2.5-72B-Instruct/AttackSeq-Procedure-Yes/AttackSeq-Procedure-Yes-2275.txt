### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin, after using its C&C capabilities, is likely to leverage its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files during the process of gathering operational intelligence for Collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C&C Capabilities (C375h and 1Bh):** These modules are used to manage communications and control compromised systems. This is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
   - **File and Directory Discovery (T1083):** This technique is used to identify file and directory paths on a system, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Scanning for Deleted Files:** The question specifically asks about scanning for deleted files, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, file and directory discovery can be a precursor to more detailed file operations, including the identification of deleted files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **C2 Capabilities:** After establishing C2, an attacker typically needs to gather more information about the compromised system to understand its environment and identify valuable data.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The Discovery phase is crucial for understanding the system's structure, including file and directory paths. This information can help the attacker in subsequent stages, such as Collection.
   - **Scanning for Deleted Files:** While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, scanning for deleted files can be a logical extension of file and directory discovery. Deleted files might contain sensitive information that the attacker wants to recover.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Regin would leverage its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files as part of its operational intelligence gathering.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
