### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Charming Kitten.
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gather sensitive information.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten will proceed to acquire infrastructures by developing phishing sites that impersonate legitimate services.
   - Finally, it asks if these phishing sites will be used to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique involves using legitimate services (like email or social media) to send spear-phishing messages.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using spear-phishing to gather information about the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broader category that includes various forms of phishing, including spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service):** The initial step of gathering sensitive information through spear-phishing aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Initial Access (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service):** Developing phishing sites that impersonate legitimate services and using them to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks aligns with the initial access phase.
   - **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing):** This broader category supports the idea of using phishing to gain initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs.
   - Charming Kitten is known to use spear-phishing for reconnaissance and to develop phishing sites to gain initial access.
   - The logical progression from gathering sensitive information to developing and using phishing sites to steal credentials is a common and effective attack pattern.
