### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers to gain initial access.
     2. Using the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
     3. Employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to spread malware across a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions gaining initial access by scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers. This is a common initial access technique, but it does not involve removable media.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question then describes using the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network. This is a plausible step in an attack sequence.
     - The final step involves using the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices. This aligns with the T1091 technique for lateral movement.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that the sequence described in the question is likely.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the sequence described in the question is not likely.

### Final Reasoning:
- The initial access method (scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities on web servers) is a common and plausible first step.
- Using the infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network is a logical next step.
- Employing the Explosive Trojan to infect connected USB devices for lateral movement aligns with the T1091 technique.

However, the question implies that the attackers will manually spread to the entire network before using the Explosive Trojan. This manual spreading step is not typically necessary if the Explosive Trojan can achieve lateral movement through removable media. The use of removable media (T1091) is more efficient and common for lateral movement once initial access is gained.

### Final Answer:
B: No
