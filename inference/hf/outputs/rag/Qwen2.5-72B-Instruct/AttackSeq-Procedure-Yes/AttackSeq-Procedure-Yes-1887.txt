### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing, and before using WMI for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts (Persistence):** This technique involves using legitimate user and service accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (Execution):** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.
   - **T1003.001-LSASS Memory (Credential Access):** This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique is used to gain credentials, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique is used for lateral movement, which aligns with the last part of the question.
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using the credentials obtained to maintain access, which is a logical step after gaining credentials.

   The question also mentions the use of native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of internal reconnaissance. This is a common step in the attack chain after gaining credentials and before lateral movement. It helps the attacker understand the network environment and identify potential targets for lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the logical steps in the attack chain, it is plausible that FIN13 would use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance before using WMI for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
