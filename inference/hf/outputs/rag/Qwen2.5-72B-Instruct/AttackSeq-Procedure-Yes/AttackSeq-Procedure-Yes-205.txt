### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow, after using `cmd.exe` to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor for Execution, will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase before dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - FamousSparrow uses `cmd.exe` to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor. This is a common method for initial execution of malware.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Collecting system information and probing files is a typical step in the Discovery phase. This helps the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Credential Access Phase:**
     - The related TTPs indicate that FamousSparrow is known to use techniques like T1003.001 (LSASS Memory) and T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) to dump credentials. Using a custom version of Mimikatz is a well-known method for this purpose.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical attack lifecycle of an advanced threat actor like FamousSparrow. After gaining initial access and executing the backdoor, it is logical for the attacker to perform Discovery to gather information about the system and then proceed to Credential Access to extract valuable credentials.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
