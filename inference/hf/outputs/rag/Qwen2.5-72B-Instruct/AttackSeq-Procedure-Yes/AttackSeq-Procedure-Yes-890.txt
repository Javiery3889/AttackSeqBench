### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear) is likely to use legitimate tools already present in the victim's system for lateral movement after executing malware through spear-phishing exploit documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spear-phishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting system vulnerabilities to evade defenses.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access and move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT28 is known for using a combination of custom and legitimate tools to achieve their objectives. They often leverage legitimate tools to blend in with normal network traffic and evade detection. This aligns with the use of T1078 (Valid Accounts) and T1211 (Exploitation for Defense Evasion).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that APT28 sticks to their traditional toolset and does not use legitimate tools for lateral movement. However, this is less likely given their known tactics of using a mix of custom and legitimate tools to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known behavior of APT28, it is more plausible that they would leverage legitimate tools already present in the victim's system for lateral movement to evade defenses.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
