### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000, after stealing sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives, is likely to compress and encrypt this data for exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a common method for adversaries to send stolen data back to their servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocol, which is a more secure method to prevent interception.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 will compress and encrypt the data before exfiltrating it over a C2 channel.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Compressing and encrypting data is a common practice to reduce the size of the data and protect it from being intercepted or detected during exfiltration.
       - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is a relevant technique, and it is often used in conjunction with data compression and encryption to ensure the data is transmitted securely.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 will not compress and encrypt the data before exfiltrating it over a C2 channel.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Not compressing and encrypting the data would make it more vulnerable to detection and interception, which is less likely for a sophisticated malware like T9000.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in exfiltration, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T9000 will compress and encrypt the data before exfiltrating it over a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
