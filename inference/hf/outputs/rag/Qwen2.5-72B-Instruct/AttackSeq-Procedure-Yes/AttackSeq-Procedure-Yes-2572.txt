### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file into the system's temporary directory.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique involves using HTML to smuggle malicious content into a target system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves executing JavaScript code to perform various malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves executing Visual Basic (VBA) code to perform malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscated VBA-Macro Functions:** The use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads aligns with the T1059.005 (Visual Basic) technique.
   - **Dropping a File into the Temporary Directory:** This is a common step in many malware infections, often used to stage the next phase of the attack.
   - **JavaScript Downloader:** The JavaScript downloader aligns with the T1059.007 (JavaScript) technique.
   - **Dropping 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL:** This is a plausible action for a JavaScript downloader, as it can be used to download and execute additional payloads.
   - **'surprise.php' Revealing Source Code with Visitor Tracking:** This part of the question is less directly related to the TTPs provided. However, it is a common tactic for web-based attacks to include tracking mechanisms to monitor the success of the infection or to gather additional information about the victim.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the provided TTPs. The use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads, dropping a file into the temporary directory, and then using a JavaScript downloader to drop 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL are all consistent with the techniques mentioned.
   - The inclusion of 'surprise.php' with visitor tracking is a common tactic in web-based attacks and can be part of a broader attack strategy.
