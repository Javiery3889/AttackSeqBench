### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to conduct discovery activities (such as system network configuration and process discovery) after using the credential harvesting tool Responder to acquire login credentials, before using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the network configuration of a system, such as IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves adversaries using tools like Responder to capture and relay network authentication requests to gain access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries determining the primary user, system owner, or system purpose of a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - After using Responder to harvest credentials, it is logical for the Lazarus group to conduct discovery activities to understand the network and system environment better. This includes discovering system network configurations (T1016) and system owner/user information (T1033). These activities help in planning and executing further actions, such as lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group would not conduct discovery activities after harvesting credentials. However, this is less likely because discovery activities are crucial for understanding the environment and planning subsequent actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, the most plausible answer is that the Lazarus group would conduct discovery activities after harvesting credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
