### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN4 is likely to use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials and then transmit those credentials to their C2 servers for credential access.
   - The key elements are:
     - Use of unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.
     - Use of spearphishing emails.
     - Use of embedded VBA macros.
     - Prompting victims for Outlook credentials.
     - Transmitting credentials to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) for execution, which aligns with the use of embedded VBA macros.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with links, which could be used to prompt victims for credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with attachments, which could also be used to deliver VBA macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FIN4 will use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials and transmit them to C2 servers.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1059.005-Visual Basic:** VBA macros can be used to execute malicious code.
       - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** Spearphishing emails with links can be used to trick victims into providing credentials.
       - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** Spearphishing emails with attachments can deliver VBA macros.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN4 will not use the described method.
     - This is less supported by the related TTPs, as they all align with the described method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described method, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN4 will use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials and transmit those credentials to their C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
