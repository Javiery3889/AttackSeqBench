### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro.
   - The VBA macro is expected to use `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - Finally, the malware is expected to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBA) for execution, which is consistent with the use of a VBA macro in a PowerPoint document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro is a common initial access technique.
   - **Execution:**
     - The VBA macro using `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper is a plausible next step. `mshta.exe` is often used to execute scripts and download files from the internet.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours is a common method for establishing persistence. This ensures that the malware continues to run even if the system is restarted.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described and the related TTPs provided, the sequence is highly plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
