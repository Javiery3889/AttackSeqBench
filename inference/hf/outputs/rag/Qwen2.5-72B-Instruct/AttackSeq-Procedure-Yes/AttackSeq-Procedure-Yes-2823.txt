### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlackSoul, after communicating with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding, is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Exfiltration** and the technique is **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.
   - T1041 describes a scenario where an adversary exfiltrates data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
     - Given that the related TTPs specifically mention T1041, which is about exfiltration over the C2 channel, this choice aligns well with the described scenario.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that BlackSoul will not exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that exfiltration over the C2 channel is a common technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
