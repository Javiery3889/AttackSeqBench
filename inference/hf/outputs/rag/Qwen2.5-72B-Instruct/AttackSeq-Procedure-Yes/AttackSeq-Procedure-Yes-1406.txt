### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. These messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges to lure victims.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials before locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts:** This technique involves compromising accounts to gain access to resources or to use them for further attacks.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate entities to gain trust and access.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This sub-technique involves compromising email accounts as part of the resource development process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Impersonation (T1656):** The question mentions that attackers impersonate technical support or friends, which aligns with the impersonation technique.
   - **Compromise Accounts (T1586):** The question also mentions that attackers collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials, which aligns with the compromise accounts technique.
   - **Email Accounts (T1586.002):** The question implies that email credentials are collected, which aligns with the sub-technique of compromising email accounts.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (impersonation, phishing, and account compromise) is a common and logical attack pattern.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that attackers would use phishing sites to collect credentials and then lock out the original owners by changing account passwords.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
