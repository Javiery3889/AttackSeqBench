### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious Office documents that exploit the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.
   - It then asks whether the attacker, specifically Gallmaker, is likely to use living off the land (LotL) tactics and remove tools from the victim’s machines after executing PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using the DDE protocol in Office documents to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The spear-phishing emails with malicious Office documents (T1566.001) are used to gain initial access.
     - The DDE protocol (T1559.002) is then used to execute commands in memory, which is a common technique for executing payloads without writing to disk.
   - **Living Off the Land (LotL) and Defense Evasion:**
     - Living off the land (LotL) tactics involve using legitimate system tools and processes to carry out malicious activities, which can help evade detection.
     - Removing tools from the victim’s machine after execution is a form of cleanup to avoid leaving traces, which is a common defense evasion technique.
   - **Gallmaker’s Behavior:**
     - Gallmaker is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain stealth and evade detection.
     - Given the use of DDE and PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads, it is plausible that Gallmaker would use LotL tactics and perform cleanup to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that Gallmaker would use LotL tactics and remove tools from the victim’s machines after executing PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
