### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dexphot is likely to use the SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader to obfuscate its files or information as part of its defense evasion tactics after ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute code, which can be used to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence through Scheduled Task (T1053.005):** Dexphot is known to use scheduled tasks to ensure persistence, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Defense Evasion through Rundll32 (T1218.011):** Dexphot has been known to use rundll32.exe to execute code, which is a common technique for defense evasion.
   - **Obfuscation (T1027):** Obfuscating files or information is a common defense evasion technique used by malware to avoid detection. The question specifically asks if Dexphot is likely to use SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader for this purpose.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes:** This suggests that Dexphot is likely to use SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader to obfuscate its files or information.
   - **Answer B: No:** This suggests that Dexphot is not likely to use SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader for obfuscation.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that Dexphot is known to use various techniques for persistence and defense evasion, including scheduled tasks and rundll32, it is plausible that it would also use obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. The use of SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader for obfuscation aligns with the known behavior of malware to employ multiple defense evasion tactics.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
