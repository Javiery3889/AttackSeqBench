### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Smooth Operator malware, after establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Communication:**
     - The malware has already established communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS, which aligns with T1071.001.
   - **Custom Data Encoding:**
     - The use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a common technique to evade detection and ensure the integrity of the communication.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The question asks if the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.
     - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) suggests that the data exfiltration will likely use the same channel (HTTPS) that was used for C2 communication.
   - **HTTP GET Request:**
     - While HTTPS is used for C2 communication, the specific use of a HTTP GET request for exfiltration is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, it is a common method for exfiltration over web protocols.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the malware is already using HTTPS for C2 communication and the related TTPs suggest exfiltration over the same channel, it is plausible that the malware will use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration, as it is a common method for data exfiltration over web protocols.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
