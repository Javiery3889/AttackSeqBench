### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gamaredon's modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase after the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from the victim's system to the attacker's system without requiring manual intervention.
   - **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the transfer of data over the command and control (C2) channel, which is a communication channel used by the attacker to control the malware and receive data from the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - This aligns with the T1020 technique, which describes automated exfiltration.
     - It also aligns with the T1041 technique, which describes exfiltration over the C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the modules will not automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - This does not align with the T1020 technique, which specifically mentions automated exfiltration.
     - It also does not align with the T1041 technique, which describes exfiltration over the C2 channel, which is typically automated.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
