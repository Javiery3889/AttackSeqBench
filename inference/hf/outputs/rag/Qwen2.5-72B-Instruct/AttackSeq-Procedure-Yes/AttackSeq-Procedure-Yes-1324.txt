### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP, after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include files, registry entries, and other system data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):** This technique is relevant to the question as it involves gathering information through keystrokes, which is a common method for collecting sensitive data.
   - **Data from Local System (T1005):** This technique is also relevant as it involves collecting data from the local system, which can include searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.
   - **Automated Exfiltration (T1020):** This technique is relevant as it involves the transfer of collected data to remote servers, which aligns with the exfiltration step mentioned in the question.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the data.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence: keylogging (T1056.001) and data collection from the local system (T1005) are both part of the collection phase, and automated exfiltration (T1020) is part of the exfiltration phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to use these methods.
     - However, the related TTPs indicate that these methods are indeed part of the attack sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
