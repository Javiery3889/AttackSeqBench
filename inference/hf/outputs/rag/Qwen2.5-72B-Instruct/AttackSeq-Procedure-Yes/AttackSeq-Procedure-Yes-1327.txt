### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke, after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data to a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not part of the command and control (C2) infrastructure, such as FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** CosmicDuke can automate the exfiltration process.
       - **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** FTP is an unencrypted protocol, and using stored login credentials to access remote servers is a common method.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will not automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that automated exfiltration over unencrypted protocols is a known technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that CosmicDuke will automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
