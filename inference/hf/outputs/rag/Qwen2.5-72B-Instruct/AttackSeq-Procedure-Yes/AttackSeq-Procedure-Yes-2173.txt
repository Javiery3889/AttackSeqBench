### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Taidoor malware:
     - Evades defenses by obfuscating MAC addresses.
     - Utilizes obfuscated MAC addresses as RC4 encryption keys for network communication.
     - Communicates with C&C servers.
     - Installs an RC4-encrypted executable file.
     - Creates an autorun registry entry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves the use of encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or payloads, making them harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to encrypt command and control (C2) communications, making them harder to intercept and analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscating MAC Addresses and Using RC4 Encryption:**
     - The Taidoor malware uses obfuscated MAC addresses as RC4 encryption keys. This aligns with the T1027.013 technique, which involves encryption to evade detection.
   - **Communicating with C&C Servers:**
     - The use of RC4 encryption for network communication aligns with the T1573.001 technique, which involves symmetric cryptography for C2 communications.
   - **Installing an RC4-Encrypted Executable File:**
     - This action is consistent with the T1027.013 technique, as it involves encrypting files to evade detection.
   - **Creating an Autorun Registry Entry:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, creating an autorun registry entry is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a logical next step after establishing communication with C&C servers and installing the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described actions with the related TTPs and the logical sequence of steps a malware would take, the most plausible answer is that the Taidoor malware will indeed communicate with C&C servers, install an RC4-encrypted executable file, and create an autorun registry entry during its command and control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
