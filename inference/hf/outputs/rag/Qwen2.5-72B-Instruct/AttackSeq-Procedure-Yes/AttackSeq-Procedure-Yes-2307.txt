### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that an adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase (e.g., file and directory lists from network shared drives) before exfiltrating this data using cloud storage web services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves the adversary using cloud storage services to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the adversary using automated tools to collect data from the target system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the adversary exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique supports the idea that the adversary will collect data, which includes copying file and directory lists.
       - **T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique supports the idea that the collected data will be exfiltrated using cloud storage services.
       - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique is also relevant, as the data could be exfiltrated over the C2 channel before being moved to cloud storage.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the adversary will not copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice is less likely because the related TTPs (T1119 and T1567.002) strongly suggest that the adversary will collect and then exfiltrate the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is more plausible that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data using cloud storage web services.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
