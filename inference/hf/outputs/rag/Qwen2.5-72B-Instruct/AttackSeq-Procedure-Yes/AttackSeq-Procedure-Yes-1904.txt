### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lampion trojan:
     - It achieves persistence by creating a .lnk file and a new VBS file to ensure execution at system startup.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will then communicate with a C2 server to send collected data using an application layer protocol for Command and Control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
   - These TTPs indicate that the malware is likely to use web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) or mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is highly plausible. The T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1071.003 (Mail Protocols) techniques are specifically designed for Command and Control communication, which aligns with the question's scenario.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware is expected to use web or mail protocols for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
