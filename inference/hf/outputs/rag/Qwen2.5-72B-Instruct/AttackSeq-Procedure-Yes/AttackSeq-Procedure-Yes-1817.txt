### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Earth Wendigo is likely to have stolen username and password pairs from intercepted HTTPS POST requests through a Service Worker script before establishing a WebSocket connection to the victims' browsers for command and control of the JavaScript backdoor and instructing it to read and exfiltrate emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves executing JavaScript code to perform various actions, such as establishing a backdoor or exfiltrating data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Earth Wendigo would have stolen username and password pairs from intercepted HTTPS POST requests through a Service Worker script.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Service Worker scripts can intercept and manipulate network requests, including HTTPS POST requests.
       - Stealing credentials from intercepted requests is a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
       - Once the credentials are stolen, the attacker can use them to establish a WebSocket connection and control the JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Earth Wendigo would not have stolen username and password pairs from intercepted HTTPS POST requests through a Service Worker script.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While it is possible to establish a WebSocket connection and control a JavaScript backdoor without stealing credentials, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of stealing credentials first.
       - Stealing credentials is a common and effective method to gain initial access and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common attack patterns, it is more plausible that Earth Wendigo would have stolen username and password pairs from intercepted HTTPS POST requests through a Service Worker script before establishing the WebSocket connection and controlling the JavaScript backdoor.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
