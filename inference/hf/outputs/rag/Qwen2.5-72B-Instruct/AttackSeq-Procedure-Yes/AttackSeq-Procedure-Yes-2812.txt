### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Derusbi malware, after gathering system information and beaconing it to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via port 443, is likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to `/photos/photo.asp` in its C2 interactions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communications. It is common for malware to use these protocols to blend in with normal web traffic and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port 443**: This is the standard port for HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted. Using this port helps the malware blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection by network security systems.
   - **HTTP Beaconing**: This is a common method for malware to maintain a persistent connection with the C2 server. It involves periodic check-ins to receive commands or send data.
   - **Obfuscated Communication**: Malware often uses obfuscation techniques to hide the content of its communications, making it harder for security systems to detect malicious activity.
   - **HTTP POST Requests to /photos/photo.asp**: This specific endpoint suggests that the malware is using a common web path to disguise its C2 communications. The use of a seemingly benign path like `/photos/photo.asp` is a common tactic to avoid raising suspicion.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the use of port 443 (HTTPS), the likelihood of HTTP beaconing, the use of obfuscation, and the specific endpoint `/photos/photo.asp`, it is highly plausible that the Derusbi malware would employ these techniques in its C2 interactions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
