### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Emissary Panda (a known threat actor) exploited a specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells and then used Mimikatz to dump credentials for further network access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. In this case, the vulnerability is CVE-2019-0604 in Microsoft SharePoint.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Emissary Panda did exploit the vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells and then used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Initial Access:** The related TTP (T1190) confirms that exploiting a public-facing application (in this case, Microsoft SharePoint) is a common method for initial access.
       - **Webshells:** Installing webshells is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access through a vulnerability. Webshells can be used to maintain persistence and execute further commands.
       - **Mimikatz:** Once the attacker has gained access and established a foothold, using tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials is a typical next step to gain further network access and move laterally within the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Emissary Panda did not exploit the vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells and then use Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTP (T1190) and the typical attack sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that Emissary Panda did exploit the vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells and then used Mimikatz to dump credentials for further network access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
