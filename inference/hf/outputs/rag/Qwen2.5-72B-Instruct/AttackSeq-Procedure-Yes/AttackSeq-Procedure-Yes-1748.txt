### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021.
   - They used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor would then use exploits to compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement before establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.004-IIS Components:**
     - This technique involves using IIS components to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance aligns with the Discovery phase and the T1018 technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using exploits to compromise additional IIS servers, which aligns with the Lateral Movement phase and the T1570 technique.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function aligns with the Persistence phase and the T1505.004 technique.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Discovery:** Use SharpHound and PowerSploit to gather information about the network.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** Use exploits to compromise additional IIS servers.
     3. **Persistence:** Establish command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - It is logical for a threat actor to perform reconnaissance, then move laterally, and finally establish persistence.
