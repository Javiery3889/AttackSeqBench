### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the PyFlash backdoor gathers system information (systeminfo, tasklist, arp) as part of the discovery phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that PyFlash will communicate with a hardcoded C&C server using AES-128 in CBC mode on specific ports (like 8,000) for command and control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, which aligns with the actions described in the question (systeminfo, tasklist, arp).
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like AES-128 in CBC mode) to encrypt C&C communications, which is also mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that PyFlash will communicate with a hardcoded C&C server using AES-128 in CBC mode on specific ports.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** confirms that gathering system information is part of the discovery phase.
       - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** confirms that using AES-128 in CBC mode for C&C communications is a known technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that PyFlash will communicate with a hardcoded C&C server using AES-128 in CBC mode on specific ports.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that both the discovery and C&C communication techniques are plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that PyFlash will indeed communicate with a hardcoded C&C server using AES-128 in CBC mode on specific ports.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
