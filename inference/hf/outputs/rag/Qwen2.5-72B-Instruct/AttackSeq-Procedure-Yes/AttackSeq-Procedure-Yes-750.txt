### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the NewPass implant is likely to communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
   - The key points are:
     - The implant uses a loader library to decode the configuration file.
     - The implant evades detection.
     - The implant exfiltrates information using encrypted POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will communicate with the C2 server before exfiltrating information.
     - This aligns with the T1041 technique, which indicates that exfiltration often occurs over the same channel used for C2 communications.
     - It is common for malware to establish a C2 connection first to receive commands or instructions before performing exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not communicate with the C2 server before exfiltrating information.
     - This is less likely because establishing a C2 connection is a crucial step for many malware operations, including receiving commands and instructions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common sequence of operations in malware, it is more plausible that the NewPass implant will communicate with the C2 server before exfiltrating information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
