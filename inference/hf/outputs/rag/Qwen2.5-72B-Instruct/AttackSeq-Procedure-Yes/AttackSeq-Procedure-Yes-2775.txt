### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Dragonfly group, after using self-deleting code (a defense evasion technique), likely focused on gathering system information (a discovery tactic) on Windows systems before using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. Self-deleting code is a common method used in this technique.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network, often to access other systems and spread the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal):**
     - The Dragonfly group used self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence. This is a common tactic to avoid detection by security systems and forensic analysis.
   - **Discovery:**
     - While the question mentions gathering system information, the related TTPs do not explicitly list a discovery technique. However, it is a logical step for an attacker to gather system information before moving laterally. This is because understanding the target system's configuration and network topology is crucial for effective lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol):**
     - After gathering system information, the Dragonfly group would likely use RDP to move laterally. RDP is a common method for remote access and is often used to spread the attack to other systems within the network.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns. After evading detection by removing indicators, the attacker would typically gather system information to understand the target environment. This information is then used to facilitate lateral movement using RDP.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
