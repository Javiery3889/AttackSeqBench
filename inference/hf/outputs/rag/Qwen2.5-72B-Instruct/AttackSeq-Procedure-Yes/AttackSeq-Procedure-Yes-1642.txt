### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the PurpleFox backdoor:
     - Ensuring persistence by replacing `sens.dll` with the PurpleFox backdoor to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).
     - Installing a rootkit driver to evade detection by hiding files and processes.
     - Executing a .vbs script to create a firewall rule blocking ports 135, 139, and 445.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence. This aligns with the first part of the question where PurpleFox replaces `sens.dll` to run as the SENS.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall:**
     - This technique involves modifying the system firewall to evade detection. This aligns with the part of the question where a .vbs script is used to create a firewall rule blocking specific ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service):**
     - The question states that PurpleFox ensures persistence by replacing `sens.dll` with the backdoor to run as the SENS. This is a known technique for achieving persistence and is consistent with the related TTP.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall):**
     - The question mentions that PurpleFox executes a .vbs script to create a firewall rule blocking ports 135, 139, and 445. This is a method to evade detection by modifying the system firewall, which is consistent with the related TTP.
   - **Rootkit Driver:**
     - The question also mentions the installation of a rootkit driver to hide files and processes. While this is a common technique for defense evasion, it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs provided. However, it is a plausible step for an advanced backdoor like PurpleFox to take to maintain stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the persistence and firewall modification techniques with the related TTPs, and the plausibility of a rootkit driver for advanced evasion, the most likely answer is that PurpleFox will indeed perform all the described actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
