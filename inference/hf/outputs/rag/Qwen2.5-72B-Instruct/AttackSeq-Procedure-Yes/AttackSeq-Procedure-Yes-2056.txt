### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Anunak malware will use backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities after leveraging Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation during lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to encapsulate and tunnel malicious traffic. This can include DNS tunneling.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique specifically involves using DNS to communicate with a command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The related TTPs indicate that DNS tunneling (T1071.004) and protocol tunneling (T1572) are common techniques used for command and control activities. Given that Anunak malware is known for sophisticated command and control mechanisms, it is plausible that it would use these techniques.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Anunak malware would not use backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities. However, the related TTPs provide strong evidence that these techniques are commonly used in such scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known capabilities of Anunak malware, it is likely that it would use backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
