### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware after deploying malware components like small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - This indicates that the use of autorun registry settings is a known technique for maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT will use autorun registry settings to maintain persistence.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is a plausible and well-supported answer. The use of registry run keys is a common method for maintaining persistence, and it aligns with the tactics and techniques described.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT will not use autorun registry settings to maintain persistence.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which specifically mention the use of registry run keys for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that Darkhotel APT will use autorun registry settings to maintain persistence on compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
