### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TG1021, after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, likely removed all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1070.004 - File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of an attack.
   - **T1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools:** This technique involves modifying or removing indicators from tools to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that TG1021 did remove all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.
     - **T1070.004 - File Deletion:** This technique aligns with the idea of removing files to avoid detection.
     - **T1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools:** This technique also aligns with the idea of removing or modifying indicators to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TG1021 did not remove all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that removing files and indicators is a common defense evasion strategy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is likely that TG1021 demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
