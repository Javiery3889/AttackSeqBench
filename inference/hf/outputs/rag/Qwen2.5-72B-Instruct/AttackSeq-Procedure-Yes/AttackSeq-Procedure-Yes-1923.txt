### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a spyware uses `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases for credentials (Credential Access) and then potentially leverages C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities, using IP addresses related to the initial execution flow and additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the use of `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information from the browser, which can be used to understand the victim's environment and potentially for further exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after extracting credentials, the spyware would use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities.
     - The use of C2 servers is a common next step after credential access, as the attacker needs to maintain control over the compromised system and exfiltrate data.
     - Novinhost is a known hosting service that has been used by various malicious actors for C2 activities.
     - Using IP addresses related to the initial execution flow and additional payloads is a plausible method to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the spyware would not use C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities.
     - This is less likely because maintaining a C2 channel is a critical part of many cyber attacks, especially after gaining initial access and credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of TTPs in a typical attack, the most plausible answer is that the spyware would indeed leverage C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
