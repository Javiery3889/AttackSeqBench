### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to archive collected data using utilities before exfiltrating it through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool, after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using WMIC to execute commands and scripts, which can be used for various purposes, including lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement with WMIC:** The question mentions that the Lazarus group uses WMIC for lateral movement. This is consistent with the T1047 technique, which is used to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** The question also mentions exfiltration through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool. This aligns with the T1041 technique, which involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
   - **Archiving Data:** The question asks whether the group is likely to archive collected data before exfiltration. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention archiving, it is a common practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to compress and archive data to reduce the size and make exfiltration more efficient and less detectable.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the advanced nature of the Lazarus group and the common practice of archiving data before exfiltration, it is reasonable to assume that they would take this step to ensure efficient and stealthy data exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs support the use of WMIC for lateral movement and the use of a C2 channel for exfiltration, but the archiving step is a logical extension of these techniques.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
