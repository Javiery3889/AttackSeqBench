### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) restrictions after ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.
   - The key points are:
     - ChromeLoader overriding macOS security technology.
     - CloudMensis exploiting CVE-2020-9934 for TCC bypass.
     - Using public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves bypassing macOS Gatekeeper, which is a security feature that ensures only trusted applications can run.
   - **T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (Initial Access):** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ChromeLoader and Gatekeeper Bypass (T1553.001):**
     - ChromeLoader is known for bypassing macOS security mechanisms, which aligns with the T1553.001 technique.
   - **CloudMensis and CVE-2020-9934:**
     - CVE-2020-9934 is a vulnerability in the macOS TCC database that can be exploited to bypass TCC restrictions. This aligns with the T1211 technique, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities for defense evasion.
   - **Public Cloud Storage for C2 Communication:**
     - Using public cloud storage services for C2 communication is a common technique for maintaining command and control over a compromised system. This is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a known tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     - ChromeLoader bypasses macOS security (T1553.001).
     - CloudMensis exploits CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions (T1211).
     - CloudMensis uses public cloud storage for C2 communication (common C2 technique).
