### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro, after ensuring persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory, is likely to discover system information such as the operating system version before communicating with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying or creating shortcut files (e.g., .LNK files) in the Windows startup directory to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system starts.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a registry run key or placing a file in the startup folder to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via .LNK File:** The question states that Grandoreiro ensures persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. This aligns with the T1547.009-Shortcut Modification technique.
   - **Discovering System Information:** The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will discover system information such as the operating system version before communicating with the C&C server.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:** The question mentions that Grandoreiro uses the RealThinClient SDK to communicate with the C&C server to receive commands.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Persistence:** Grandoreiro ensures persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
     2. **System Information Discovery:** It is common for malware to gather system information such as the operating system version before communicating with the C&C server. This information can be used to tailor the attack or to report back to the attackers.
     3. **C&C Communication:** After gathering system information, the malware communicates with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive further commands.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible because it follows a logical and common attack pattern. Malware often gathers system information to better understand the environment it is operating in before communicating with the C&C server.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
