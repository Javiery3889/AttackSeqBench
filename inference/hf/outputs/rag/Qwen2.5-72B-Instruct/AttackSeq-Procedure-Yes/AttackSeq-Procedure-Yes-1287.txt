### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document containing encoded PowerShell scripts.
   - These scripts are executed through macro-triggered events.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to execute them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document containing encoded PowerShell scripts.
     - These scripts are executed through macro-triggered events, which aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions using decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence.
     - This step involves deobfuscating the encoded scripts to execute them, which aligns with the T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information technique.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The question also mentions employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.
     - This aligns with the T1027.010-Command Obfuscation technique.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The attack starts with initial access using encoded PowerShell scripts, which are then deobfuscated to drop persistence components.
   - After establishing persistence, the campaign employs obfuscation methods to evade detection.
