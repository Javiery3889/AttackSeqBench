### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to use specific tools (ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil) for privilege escalation after conducting internal reconnaissance with native OS binaries and custom malware.
   - It also asks if they are likely to use WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software, system, or configuration vulnerabilities to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for valid credentials using wordlists.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance with Native OS Binaries and Custom Malware:**
     - FIN13 is known to use internal reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment. This aligns with the T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning technique, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question mentions using ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation. These tools are commonly used for credential dumping and exploiting vulnerabilities, which aligns with T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions using WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. WMI is a known technique for lateral movement (T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation), and custom web shells are often used for maintaining persistence and further movement within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that FIN13 would use the mentioned tools for privilege escalation and lateral movement after conducting internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
