### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the malware PyFlash:
     - It executes OS-related commands like `systeminfo` and `ipconfig` to gather machine information.
     - It then communicates with a hardcoded C&C server.
     - The communication is said to use AES-128 encryption in CBC mode for sending exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques to obfuscate command and control traffic.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which aligns with the use of `systeminfo` and `ipconfig`.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like AES) to encrypt command and control traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that PyFlash will communicate with its C&C server using AES-128 encryption in CBC mode.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1082-System Information Discovery** confirms that PyFlash gathers system information.
       - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** confirms that PyFlash uses symmetric cryptography (AES) for communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that PyFlash will not use AES-128 encryption in CBC mode for communication.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which specifically mention the use of symmetric cryptography.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that PyFlash will indeed communicate with its C&C server using AES-128 encryption in CBC mode.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
