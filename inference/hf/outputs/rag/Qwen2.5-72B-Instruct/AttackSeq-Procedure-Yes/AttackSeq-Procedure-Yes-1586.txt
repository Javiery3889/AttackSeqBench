### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000, after establishing persistence by modifying registry keys to ensure malicious DLLs run after a reboot, is likely to perform sandbox evasion by designing its multi-stage installation process to avoid detection from security researchers and analysis environments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
   - These TTPs indicate that the malware is capable of detecting and evading virtualized and sandboxed environments, which are commonly used by security researchers to analyze malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 will perform sandbox evasion. Given the related TTPs, this is a plausible scenario. Malware often includes sandbox evasion techniques to avoid detection and analysis, which aligns with the T1497 technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 will not perform sandbox evasion. However, this is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware is capable of and likely to use sandbox evasion techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of sophisticated malware, it is highly likely that T9000 will perform sandbox evasion to avoid detection from security researchers and analysis environments.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
