### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the GreyEnergy group after compromising a computer.
   - The initial compromise is done using GreyEnergy mini.
   - Tools like Nmap and Mimikatz are used to map the network and collect credentials.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is a common method used by tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Compromise:**
     - The use of GreyEnergy mini to compromise the initial computer is consistent with the capabilities of the GreyEnergy group.
   - **Network Mapping and Credential Collection:**
     - Using Nmap to map the network and Mimikatz to collect credentials (specifically from LSASS memory) aligns with the T1003.001 technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question asks if the group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
     - Both PsExec and WinExe are commonly used tools for lateral movement in Windows environments.
     - The T1570 technique (Lateral Tool Transfer) supports the idea of transferring these tools to remote systems to facilitate movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement after collecting credentials and mapping the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
