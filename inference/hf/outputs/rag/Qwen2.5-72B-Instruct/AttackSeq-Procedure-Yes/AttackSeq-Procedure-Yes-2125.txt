### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Konni APT Group.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether VBScripts and batch files like 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' are likely to execute other scripts such as 'resolve.dns' as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to achieve persistence, which aligns with the use of 'stopedge.bat' to schedule 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBScript) to execute code, which aligns with the use of 'install.vbs' and potentially other VBScripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that VBScripts and batch files like 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' are likely to execute other scripts such as 'resolve.dns'.
     - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' are part of a larger script execution chain. The use of VBScript (T1059.005) and scheduled tasks (T1053.005) indicates a complex attack sequence where multiple scripts are executed to achieve persistence and other objectives.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that VBScripts and batch files like 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' are not likely to execute other scripts such as 'resolve.dns'.
     - This choice is less plausible given the related TTPs, which indicate the use of multiple scripts and scheduled tasks in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely answer is that various VBScripts and batch files will execute other scripts as part of their attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
