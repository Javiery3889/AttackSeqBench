### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Seaduke malware:
     - Retrieval of detailed bot/system information.
     - Secure deletion of itself using a 'seppuku' function.
     - Communication with a C&C server.
     - Remaining under the attackers' control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding methods to obfuscate or encode data before sending it over the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Retrieval of Detailed Bot/System Information:**
     - This is a common initial action for malware to gather information about the infected system.
   - **Secure Deletion of Itself Using a 'Seppuku' Function:**
     - The 'seppuku' function is a self-destruction mechanism, which is often used to remove traces of the malware from the system.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols suggests that the malware can use HTTP/HTTPS to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Remaining Under Attackers' Control:**
     - The related TTP T1132.001-Standard Encoding suggests that the communication can be encoded to avoid detection.
   - **Layered Encoding and Encryption:**
     - Layered encoding and encryption are common techniques to secure and obfuscate communication, making it harder to detect and analyze.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Seaduke will communicate with its C&C server and remain under the attackers' control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption after performing the initial actions.
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that Seaduke can use HTTP/HTTPS for communication and employ encoding to maintain control.
   - However, the 'seppuku' function, which securely deletes the malware, suggests that the malware is designed to remove itself from the system, which would typically terminate its ability to communicate with the C&C server.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The 'seppuku' function, which securely deletes the malware, is likely to terminate the malware's ability to communicate with the C&C server, making it unlikely that it will remain under the attackers' control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption.
