### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit before gaining initial access through a deserialization attack and a 0-day vulnerability on internet-facing Windows IIS servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit are typically used for reconnaissance and discovery. SharpHound is used to map out Active Directory environments, and PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts for various tasks, including information gathering.
     - The related TTPs T1018 (Remote System Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery) align with the use of these tools for gathering information about the target environment.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The technique T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) aligns with the described method of gaining initial access by exploiting a deserialization vulnerability and a 0-day vulnerability on internet-facing Windows IIS servers.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - It is logical for an attacker to perform reconnaissance and gather information about the target environment before attempting to exploit a vulnerability. This helps in identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities to exploit.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events in a typical attack, it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit before gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
