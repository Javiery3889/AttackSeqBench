### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SLUB backdoor:
     - **Discovery:** Downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands.
     - **Collection:** Creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders.
     - **Exfiltration:** Building CAB files and posting download links to a Slack channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:**
     - This technique involves compressing data into archive files (e.g., ZIP, TAR) to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, such as files from the user's Desktop.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could include posting download links to a Slack channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will indeed exfiltrate data by creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders and building CAB files before posting download links to the Slack channel.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The related TTPs support this sequence:
         - **T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** The attackers are likely to use this technique to compress the data from the Desktop folders.
         - **T1005-Data from Local System:** The attackers are collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the collection of Desktop files.
         - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** The attackers are exfiltrating the data over a C2 channel, which could include posting download links to a Slack channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not exfiltrate data in the described manner.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate that the attackers are likely to use the described techniques for data collection and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
