### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28, starting with discovery (scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems) and then asks if APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server as part of data collection efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically sending collected data to a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique aligns with the idea of automatically sending collected data to a C&C server, which is consistent with deploying additional modules for data exfiltration.
       - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a prerequisite for exfiltration.
       - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, which can be part of the same process as deploying additional modules for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 is not likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
     - The related TTPs do not support this choice:
       - The techniques mentioned (T1020, T1005, T1119) all involve data collection and exfiltration, which are consistent with deploying additional modules for these purposes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server as part of data collection efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
