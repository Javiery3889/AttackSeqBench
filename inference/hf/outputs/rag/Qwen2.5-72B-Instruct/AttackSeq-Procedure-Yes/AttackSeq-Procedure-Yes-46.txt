### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through a phishing email containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending emails with links to malicious websites or files.
   - **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, such as documents that contain malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique is directly relevant to the scenario described in the question. The email contains a malicious attachment ('Richard_Johnson.doc'), which is a common method for delivering malware.
   - **T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link:** This technique is less relevant because it involves sending links rather than attachments. However, it is still part of the broader spearphishing tactic.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This answer suggests that it is likely that the VBS macros will be executed from the embedded Microsoft Word document.
   - **B: No:** This answer suggests that it is unlikely that the VBS macros will be executed from the embedded Microsoft Word document.

5. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the email contains a malicious attachment ('Richard_Johnson.doc'), it is highly likely that the document is designed to execute VBS macros. This is a common technique used in spearphishing attacks to gain initial access to a system.
   - The presence of T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) in the related TTPs further supports this likelihood, as it directly aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
