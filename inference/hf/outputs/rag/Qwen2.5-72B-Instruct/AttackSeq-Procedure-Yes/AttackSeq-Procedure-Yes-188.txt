### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor "Infamous Chisel."
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files for Credential Access.
     - Enumerating system data directories and GPS information for Discovery.
     - Automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services for Exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system to identify potential targets for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Deploying tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files is a common technique for Credential Access.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Enumerating system data directories aligns with the T1083 technique (File and Directory Discovery).
     - GPS information is not a standard part of T1083, but it could be part of a broader Discovery phase to gather more information about the system and its environment.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services aligns with the T1020 technique (Automated Exfiltration).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The enumeration of system data directories (T1083) and the automatic exfiltration of files (T1020) are both relevant and logical steps in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
