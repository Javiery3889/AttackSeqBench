### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to develop custom remote access tools (RATs) as part of their resource development after using phishing lures related to national security and law enforcement, and before using phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Lures:** The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses phishing lures related to national security and law enforcement. This aligns with the T1566 techniques, specifically T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link).
   - **Resource Development:** The question asks if BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to develop custom remote access tools (RATs) as part of their resource development. Developing custom RATs is a common practice for advanced threat actors to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Initial Phishing:** BRONZE PRESIDENT uses phishing lures to gather information.
     - **Resource Development:** They may then develop custom RATs to enhance their capabilities.
     - **Initial Access with LNK Files:** Finally, they use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files to gain initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gathering information through phishing, it is reasonable for an advanced threat actor like BRONZE PRESIDENT to develop custom tools to enhance their capabilities before using more sophisticated methods for initial access.
