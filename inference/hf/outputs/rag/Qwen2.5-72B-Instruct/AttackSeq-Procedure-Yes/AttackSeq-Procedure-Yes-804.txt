### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists to gain initial access, GOLDBACKDOOR will execute a Windows shortcut file masquerading as a document to run an obfuscated PowerShell script for deploying the malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending emails to targets to entice them to perform an action, such as opening a malicious attachment or clicking a link.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending emails with links that lead to malicious content, often tailored to the target to increase the likelihood of success.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Campaign:**
     - The spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists is a common initial access technique used by threat actors to gain a foothold in a network.
     - The use of spear-phishing links (T1566.002) is particularly effective as it can be tailored to the interests and roles of the targets, making it more likely that they will click the link.
   - **Execution of Windows Shortcut File:**
     - After gaining initial access through the spear-phishing link, it is common for attackers to use a Windows shortcut file (LNK file) to execute malicious code.
     - These shortcut files can be designed to look like legitimate documents, making them less suspicious to the target.
   - **Running an Obfuscated PowerShell Script:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to execute a wide range of commands and actions on a Windows system.
     - Obfuscating the PowerShell script can help evade detection by security tools and make it harder for defenders to analyze the malicious activity.
   - **Deploying Malware:**
     - The final step in this sequence would be to use the PowerShell script to deploy the malware, which could be a backdoor, ransomware, or other types of malicious software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that after a successful spear-phishing campaign, GOLDBACKDOOR would use a Windows shortcut file to run an obfuscated PowerShell script for deploying the malware. This sequence aligns well with the tactics and techniques commonly used in such attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
