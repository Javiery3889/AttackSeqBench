### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Rocket Kitten is likely to use spear-phishing emails with malicious payloads for initial access, followed by the use of both simple and advanced tools during execution, and later employ debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear-phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The related TTPs clearly indicate that Rocket Kitten uses spear-phishing emails with attachments (T1566.001) for initial access. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Execution:**
     - The question mentions the use of both simple and advanced tools during execution. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention this, it is a common practice for advanced threat actors like Rocket Kitten to use a combination of tools to achieve their objectives.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The question also mentions the use of debugger evasion techniques. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention debugger evasion, it is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to avoid detection and analysis.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common practices of advanced threat actors, it is reasonable to conclude that Rocket Kitten is likely to follow the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
