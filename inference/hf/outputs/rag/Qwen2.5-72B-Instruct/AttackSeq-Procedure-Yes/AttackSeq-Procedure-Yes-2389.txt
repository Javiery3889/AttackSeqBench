### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TDrop2 malware is likely to communicate with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands, specifically leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.
   - The key points are:
     - Discovery activities have been performed.
     - Communication with C2 servers.
     - Use of encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
     - Custom base64 alphabet.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding schemes, such as base64, to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard or custom encoding schemes to obfuscate C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that TDrop2 malware will use encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
     - This aligns with the T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding technique, which involves using custom encoding schemes.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TDrop2 malware will not use encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
     - This does not align with the T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding technique, which is relevant to the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that TDrop2 malware will use encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
