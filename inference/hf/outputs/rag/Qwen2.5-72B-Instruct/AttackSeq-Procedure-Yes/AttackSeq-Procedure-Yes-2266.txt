### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts and then sends them through a POST web request.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the collected email accounts will be exfiltrated to the domain `dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.002 - Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email messages from a remote email server or service.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.003 - Email Account:** This technique involves identifying and collecting email account information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email messages from a local email client.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI, which aligns with the **Local Email Collection** (T1114.001) technique.
   - The question also mentions collecting email accounts from contacts, which aligns with the **Email Account** (T1087.003) technique.
   - The question further states that the collected email accounts are sent through a POST web request, which is a common method for exfiltrating data.
   - The domain `dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net` is a dynamic DNS domain, which is often used by attackers to maintain a persistent and flexible command and control (C2) infrastructure.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the nature of the domain `dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net`, it is plausible that the collected email accounts would be exfiltrated to this domain.
   - The use of a dynamic DNS domain suggests that the attackers are likely to use it for data exfiltration, as it provides a way to maintain communication with the compromised system even if the IP address changes.
