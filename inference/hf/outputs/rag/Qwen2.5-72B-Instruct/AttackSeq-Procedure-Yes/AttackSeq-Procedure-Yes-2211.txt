### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Earth Lusca will use protocol tunneling during the command and control phase after performing network service discovery using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the adversary is scanning for open ports and shared folders to understand the network environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan is consistent with the T1046-Network Service Discovery technique. This phase helps the adversary identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - After discovering open ports and shared folders, the next logical step for an adversary is to establish a command and control (C2) channel to maintain communication with the compromised systems.
   - **Protocol Tunneling:**
     - Protocol tunneling is a technique used to encapsulate one protocol within another to bypass network security measures. It is often used in the C2 phase to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - **Earth Lusca:**
     - Earth Lusca is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection. Given their advanced capabilities, it is plausible that they would use protocol tunneling to establish a C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that Earth Lusca will engage in protocol tunneling during the command and control phase to establish communication with compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
