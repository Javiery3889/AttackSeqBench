### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a spear-phishing attack that exploits an Adobe Flash vulnerability.
   - The exploit is delivered through links to `show.swf` files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash exploit will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes and then attempt to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image `b.gif`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending malicious files or links via email to trick users into opening them.
   - **T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Adobe Flash) to execute code.
   - **T1204.002 - Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to code execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):** The initial access is achieved through a spear-phishing attack, which aligns with the question.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The exploit of the Adobe Flash vulnerability through the `show.swf` files is a common method for client-side exploitation, which also aligns with the question.
   - **Malicious File (T1204.002):** The `show.swf` file is a malicious file that, when opened, can execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - **Payload in Animated GIF (b.gif):** After the initial exploitation, it is common for attackers to use additional techniques to evade defenses, such as embedding a payload in an animated GIF image. This is a known method to bypass security measures.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern. The use of a spear-phishing attack to deliver a Flash exploit, which then executes shellcode and uses an animated GIF to evade defenses, is a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
