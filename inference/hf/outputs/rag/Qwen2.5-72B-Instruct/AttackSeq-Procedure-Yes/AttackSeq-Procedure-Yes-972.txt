### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor, after gathering detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase, is likely to proceed towards creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, such as IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the hostname, operating system, and system architecture.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor has already performed T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery). These techniques are part of the Discovery phase, where the attacker gathers information about the system and network to understand the environment better.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - After the Discovery phase, the next logical step in the attack lifecycle is the Collection phase, where the attacker gathers data of interest. This can include creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that after gathering detailed system information and network configuration, the Aria-body backdoor would proceed to the Collection phase to gather more specific data. This is a common sequence in cyber attacks, where the initial discovery is followed by data collection to exfiltrate valuable information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Aria-body backdoor would proceed to the Collection phase after the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
