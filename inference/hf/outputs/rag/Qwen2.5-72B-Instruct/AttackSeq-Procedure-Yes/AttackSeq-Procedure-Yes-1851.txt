### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether VERMIN, after using ConfuserEx for defense evasion, is likely to collect specific system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address) during its system information discovery phase before deploying its keylogger component.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information about the network configuration of a system, including IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and machine name.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique aligns with the collection of the local IP address.
   - **T1082 - System Information Discovery:** This technique aligns with the collection of the machine name, username, OS name, and architecture.
   - Both techniques are relevant to the system information discovery phase described in the question.
   - The use of ConfuserEx for defense evasion is a separate step that does not affect the likelihood of the system information discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the related TTPs (T1016 and T1082) cover the collection of the specific system information mentioned in the question, it is likely that VERMIN will perform these actions during its system information discovery phase before deploying its keylogger component.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
