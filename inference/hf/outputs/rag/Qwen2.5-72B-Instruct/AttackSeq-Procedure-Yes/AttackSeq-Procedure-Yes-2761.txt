### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether MoonBounce, after compromising the UEFI firmware and tampering with the CORE_DXE component, is likely to operate entirely in memory to evade detection before gaining lateral movement within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1542-Pre-OS Boot:** This technique involves modifying the firmware or boot process to ensure that malicious code is executed before the operating system loads. This is consistent with the UEFI firmware-level compromise mentioned in the question.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code. This can be used to evade detection by masquerading as a legitimate process.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute arbitrary code, often to evade detection by appearing as a legitimate system process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1542-Pre-OS Boot:** This technique is used to establish persistence and ensure that the malware is executed early in the boot process. This aligns with the UEFI firmware-level compromise and tampering with the CORE_DXE component.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique can be used to load malicious code into memory, which can help evade detection by security software. This suggests that MoonBounce might operate in memory to some extent.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique can be used to execute code in memory, often in a way that is less detectable. This further supports the idea that MoonBounce might operate in memory to evade detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the use of T1542-Pre-OS Boot to establish a foothold and the techniques T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading and T1218.011-Rundll32 to evade detection, it is plausible that MoonBounce would operate in memory to some extent to avoid detection before moving laterally within the network.
