### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus group, after using backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands, deployed Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack and hinder forensic analysis.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:** This technique involves actions that prevent or impede system recovery, such as deleting backup files and Volume Shadow Copies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Lazarus group is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks. After gaining initial access and establishing command-and-control, it is plausible that they would use ransomware like Hermes to further their objectives.
     - The related TTPs (T1070.004 and T1490) align with the actions described in the question. Deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files (T1490) would inhibit system recovery, and file deletion (T1070.004) would help in covering their tracks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group did not deploy Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files. However, given the group's known tactics and the related TTPs, this seems less likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Lazarus group did deploy Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
