### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the CopyKittens group is likely to perform data exfiltration over the DNS protocol after establishing DNS Command and Control (C2) communication using a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique describes the use of DNS for C2 communication, which involves constructing unique DNS queries to send commands and receive responses from the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing DNS C2 Communication:**
     - The question states that the RAT has already established DNS C2 communication by constructing unique DNS queries with obfuscated data. This aligns with the T1071.004-DNS technique.
   - **Data Exfiltration over DNS:**
     - The question asks if data exfiltration over DNS is likely to follow. Data exfiltration over DNS is a known technique where attackers use DNS queries to send data out of the network. This is a common follow-up action after establishing C2 communication, especially when the C2 channel is already using DNS.
   - **CopyKittens Group:**
     - The CopyKittens group is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. Given their advanced capabilities, it is plausible that they would use the established DNS C2 channel for data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the established DNS C2 communication and the known capabilities of the CopyKittens group, it is likely that they will perform data exfiltration over the DNS protocol as part of their attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
