### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the CostaRicto Campaign is likely to use the SombRAT backdoor for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery after employing PowerShell injection techniques via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network services, which aligns with the use of tools like pscan and nmap.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell for execution, which is consistent with the use of the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into processes, which is consistent with the use of PowerShell injection techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Injection (T1059.001 and T1055):** The question mentions the use of PowerShell injection techniques via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module. This aligns with the T1059.001 and T1055 techniques.
   - **SombRAT Backdoor for Discovery (T1046):** The question asks if the SombRAT backdoor is used for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. The SombRAT backdoor is known for its capabilities in discovery and information gathering, which aligns with the T1046 technique.
   - **Network Service Scanning (T1046):** The question also mentions the use of tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning, which is consistent with the T1046 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described TTPs with the related TTPs and the known capabilities of the SombRAT backdoor, it is plausible that the CostaRicto Campaign would use the SombRAT backdoor for discovery activities after employing PowerShell injection techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
