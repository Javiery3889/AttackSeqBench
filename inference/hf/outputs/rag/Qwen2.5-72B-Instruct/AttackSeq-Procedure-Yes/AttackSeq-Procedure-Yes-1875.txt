### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13, after using ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and executing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, is likely to exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves deploying web shells to maintain persistence on a compromised system. Web shells are often used to provide a backdoor for continued access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials, which can be used for further attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **LSASS Memory Dumping (T1003.001):** This is a common technique used to steal credentials, which can be used to gain further access within a network.
   - **Passive Backdoors (BLUEAGAVE):** These are used to maintain command and control (C2) over a compromised system.
   - **Web Shells (T1505.003):** These are used to maintain persistence and provide a backdoor for continued access.

   Given the sequence of actions:
   - FIN13 has already dumped LSASS memory to obtain credentials.
   - They have executed passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution.

   The next logical step in an attack sequence would be to establish a persistent presence in the network. Deploying web shells (T1505.003) is a common method to achieve this. Web shells can be used to maintain access and perform further actions, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, it is likely that FIN13 would exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
