### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers use worms to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts and scan netblocks for misconfigured Docker APIs.
   - It then asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access before using command or script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute arbitrary commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves scanning the network to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Misconfigured Docker API:**
     - Misconfigured Docker API ports can be a common initial access vector. If these ports are exposed and misconfigured, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the Docker environment.
   - **Network Service Discovery (T1046):**
     - Scanning netblocks for misconfigured Docker APIs is a form of network service discovery. This step is typically performed to identify potential targets.
   - **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use command and scripting interpreters to execute malicious commands or scripts to further their objectives.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack flow:
     1. **Network Service Discovery (T1046):** Scanning netblocks to find misconfigured Docker APIs.
     2. **Initial Access:** Exploiting the misconfigured Docker API ports to gain access.
     3. **Execution (T1059):** Using command and scripting interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries.

### Final Answer:
Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, it is likely that attackers will exploit misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access before using command or script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
