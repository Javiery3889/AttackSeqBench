### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries used Empire stagers for encrypted communication in the command-and-control stage after gaining persistence through creating a local account and hijacking references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
   - These TTPs indicate that the adversaries have used COM hijacking for both privilege escalation and persistence. However, they do not directly mention command-and-control (C2) activities or the use of Empire stagers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Empire stagers are commonly used for establishing encrypted communication channels in the C2 stage. However, the related TTPs only mention COM hijacking for privilege escalation and persistence, not for C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - The related TTPs do not provide any information about the C2 stage or the use of Empire stagers. Therefore, it is not directly supported by the given TTPs.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While Empire stagers are a common tool for C2, the provided TTPs do not explicitly mention C2 activities or the use of Empire stagers. The TTPs only focus on the initial stages of privilege escalation and persistence.
   - Given the lack of information about the C2 stage in the related TTPs, it is more prudent to choose the answer that does not assume additional steps not supported by the provided information.

### Final Answer: B: No
