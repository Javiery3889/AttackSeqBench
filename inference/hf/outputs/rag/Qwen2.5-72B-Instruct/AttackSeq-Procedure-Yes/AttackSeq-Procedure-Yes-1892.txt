### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13, after using WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement with tools like BUSTEDPIPE and Invoke-SMBExec, is likely to collect targeted data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely before archiving the collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves an adversary collecting data from a target system and staging it on a different system before exfiltration. This can be done to consolidate data or to prepare it for transfer.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039 - Data from Network Shared Drive:**
     - This technique involves an adversary collecting data from network shared drives, which are often used to store sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 will collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely before archiving.
     - Given the related TTPs, this aligns well with the described behavior. T1039 indicates that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives, and T1074.002 indicates that they stage the data remotely before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FIN13 will not collect and stage data from network shared drives.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate that FIN13 engages in both data collection from network shared drives and remote data staging.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described behavior, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN13 will collect targeted data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely before archiving the collected data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
