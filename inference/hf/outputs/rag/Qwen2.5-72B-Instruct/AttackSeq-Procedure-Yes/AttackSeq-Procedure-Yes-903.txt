### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Dexphot, after using process hollowing to load encrypted executables into legitimate system processes, will ensure persistence by using `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the use of scheduled tasks is a known method for ensuring persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that scheduled tasks can also be used for execution purposes, such as running malicious code at specific times.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Hollowing**: This is a technique where a legitimate process is started, but its memory is replaced with malicious code. This is a common method for executing malware without detection.
   - **Persistence**: Ensuring that the malware remains on the system even after a reboot or system restart is a critical goal for many malware families.
   - **Schtasks.exe**: This is a command-line tool used to create, delete, query, change, run, and end scheduled tasks on a system. It is a legitimate tool but can be abused by malware to ensure persistence.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that Dexphot will use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection, which aligns with the known TTPs for persistence and execution.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that Dexphot will not use `schtasks.exe` for persistence, which contradicts the known TTPs.

### Final Reasoning:
- Given that Dexphot uses process hollowing for execution and the related TTPs indicate that scheduled tasks are a common method for ensuring persistence, it is highly likely that Dexphot will use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
