### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks, the attackers will deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for execution and then use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts. While this is a valid execution technique, it is not directly mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves using commands like "whoami" to discover the current user and system information. This aligns with the commands mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access with SocGholish:** SocGholish is a known method for delivering malware via malicious JavaScript frameworks. This aligns with the initial access phase.
   - **Deployment of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell:** Cobalt Strike is a popular post-exploitation tool often deployed using PowerShell for execution. This is a common sequence in many attack scenarios.
   - **Discovery Commands:** The commands "whoami", "net user", and "net group" are typical for system and user discovery, which aligns with the T1033 technique.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern. Initial access via SocGholish, followed by the deployment of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, and then using discovery commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" is a logical and frequently observed sequence in cyber attacks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
