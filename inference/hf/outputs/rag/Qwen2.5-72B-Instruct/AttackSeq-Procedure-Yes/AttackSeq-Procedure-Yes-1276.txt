### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Tropic Trooper after exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) to gain initial access.
   - Specifically, it asks whether the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) before the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) was used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802). This aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
   - **Backdoor Installer (UserInstall.exe):**
     - The question mentions a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe). This is likely a component used to establish persistence or further execute malicious activities.
   - **Malicious DLL Loader (wab32res.dll):**
     - The malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) is used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. This aligns with the T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading technique for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) is dropped first, followed by the use of the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject the DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
     - This sequence is plausible because the backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) would likely be used to set up the environment for the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to function effectively.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible. The backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) would likely be dropped first to set up the environment, followed by the use of the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject the DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
