### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Gamaredon group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents after using an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves using automated tools or scripts to collect sensitive information from the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) scripts to execute malicious code on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - The question mentions that Gamaredon uses Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments, which aligns with the T1566.001 technique.
   - **Execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic):**
     - The use of VBA macros for lateral movement and execution of malicious code is consistent with the T1059.005 technique.
   - **Collection (T1119-Automated Collection):**
     - After gaining access and executing the initial payload, it is common for threat actors to automate the collection of sensitive documents to ensure efficiency and thoroughness in their data exfiltration efforts. The T1119 technique specifically mentions the use of automated tools or scripts for this purpose.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like Gamaredon, it is highly likely that they will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
