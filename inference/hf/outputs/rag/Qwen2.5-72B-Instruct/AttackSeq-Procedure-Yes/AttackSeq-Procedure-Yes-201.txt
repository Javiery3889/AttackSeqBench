### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence starts with gaining Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - It then asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would acquire infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development before using cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access**
     - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
   - This TTP indicates that the initial access is gained by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which aligns with the first part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that FamousSparrow gains initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. This aligns with the T1190 technique.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The question then asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would acquire infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development.
     - Resource Development is a separate tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and it typically involves activities like registering domains, setting up servers, and acquiring infrastructure to support the attack.
     - While it is possible that FamousSparrow might acquire infrastructure, the question does not provide specific evidence or context that this is a necessary step before installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Backdoor Installation:**
     - The question mentions using cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor. This is a common post-exploitation activity to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not implausible, but it is not the most likely or necessary sequence based on the given TTPs.
   - The initial access and backdoor installation are directly related and commonly seen in attack sequences.
   - The acquisition of infrastructure for Resource Development is a separate and less immediate step that is not necessarily required before installing a backdoor.

### Final Answer:
B: No
