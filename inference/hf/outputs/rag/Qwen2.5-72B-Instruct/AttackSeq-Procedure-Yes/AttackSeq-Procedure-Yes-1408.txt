### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether cybercriminals are likely to demand ransom payments after using phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and locking out the original account owners.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves compromising social media accounts, which aligns with the scenario of collecting Instagram credentials.
   - **T1586-Compromise Accounts:** This technique is broader and includes compromising various types of accounts, which also fits the context of collecting and using Instagram credentials.
   - **T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information or funds, which suggests that the cybercriminals might use the compromised accounts for financial gain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts.
     - Given the TTPs, it is plausible that after compromising the accounts, the cybercriminals might use them for financial gain. Demanding ransom payments is a common tactic to monetize the compromise, especially if the accounts have significant followings.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals will not demand ransom payments.
     - While it is possible that the cybercriminals might use the accounts directly for further scams without demanding ransom, the TTPs related to financial theft (T1657) suggest that they are likely to seek financial gain from the compromised accounts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common tactics used by cybercriminals, it is more plausible that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
