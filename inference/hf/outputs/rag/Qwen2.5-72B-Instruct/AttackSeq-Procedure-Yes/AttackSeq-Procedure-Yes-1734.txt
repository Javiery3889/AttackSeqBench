### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has achieved credential access using Procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials and then employed 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - The question asks whether the Fox Kitten Campaign is likely to use tools like STSRCheck and PORT.EXE for lateral movement within the target networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory, which is consistent with the use of Procdump and Mimikatz.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate to other systems, which is consistent with the use of 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is also listed under defense evasion, indicating that pass-the-hash can be used to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Procdump and Mimikatz:** These tools are commonly used to extract credentials from the LSASS memory, which aligns with the T1003.001 technique.
   - **'Invoke the Hash':** This is a script or tool used to perform pass-the-hash attacks, which aligns with the T1550.002 technique.
   - **STSRCheck and PORT.EXE:** These tools are not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, STSRCheck is a tool used to check for open ports and services, and PORT.EXE is a tool used to scan for open ports. These tools can be used to identify potential targets for lateral movement, which is a common next step after gaining initial access and credentials.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (credential access and pass-the-hash) is a common attack pattern.
   - After gaining credentials and using them to authenticate to other systems, attackers often use tools to identify and target additional systems for lateral movement.
   - While STSRCheck and PORT.EXE are not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, they are commonly used in the context of lateral movement to identify potential targets.
