### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PurpleFox, after ensuring persistence by modifying registry values to replace `sens.dll` with malware, is likely to copy itself to another file, restore the original `sens.dll` file, and then execute a rootkit driver to evade defense mechanisms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1112 - Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to ensure persistence or to change system behavior.
   - **T1070 - Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to evade detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Modification (T1112):** PurpleFox is known to modify registry values to ensure persistence. This is a common tactic to ensure that the malware is executed every time the system starts.
   - **Indicator Removal (T1070):** This technique is used to remove or alter forensic artifacts, which can include restoring original files to their previous state to avoid detection.
   - **Rootkit Driver Execution:** Rootkits are often used to hide the presence of malware and evade detection. This is a common tactic in advanced malware to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that PurpleFox will copy itself to another file, restore the original `sens.dll`, and then execute a rootkit driver.
     - This sequence aligns with the TTPs of modifying the registry for persistence (T1112) and removing indicators (T1070). Restoring the original `sens.dll` and executing a rootkit driver are plausible steps to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that PurpleFox will not perform these additional steps.
     - Given the TTPs and the known behavior of advanced malware, this choice is less likely.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
