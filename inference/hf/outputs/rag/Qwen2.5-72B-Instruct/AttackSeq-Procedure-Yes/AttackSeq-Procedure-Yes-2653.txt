### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions taken by the Korplug variant after establishing persistence.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%`.
     - Setting up a scheduled task or registry entry for persistence.
     - Collecting information about the system, including using the `GetSystemTime` function.
     - Exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall:**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique is repeated, emphasizing the importance of scheduled tasks in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The question mentions creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry. This aligns with the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique.
   - **Collecting Information:**
     - The question mentions collecting information about the system, including using the `GetSystemTime` function. This is a common step in many malware sequences to gather system information.
   - **Exfiltrating Data:**
     - The question mentions exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol. This is a typical final step in many malware sequences to send collected data back to the attacker.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the related TTPs. Establishing persistence, collecting system information, and exfiltrating data are common steps in many malware attack sequences.
   - The use of the `GetSystemTime` function for system time discovery is a plausible step in the information collection phase.
