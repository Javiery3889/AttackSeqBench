### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the DNSpionage malware:
     - Decoding a PE file encoded with base64.
     - Executing the decoded PE file as a scheduled task.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will retrieve the username, hostname, and domain information to understand the environment during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary attempting to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Decoding and Execution:**
     - The malware decodes a PE file using base64 and executes it as a scheduled task. This aligns with the **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** technique, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - After the execution phase, it is common for malware to perform discovery to understand the environment it is operating in. This is a crucial step for the malware to determine what actions to take next, such as identifying the user, hostname, and domain information.
     - The **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** technique is part of the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the system and its users.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the DNSpionage malware will retrieve the username, hostname, and domain information to understand the environment during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
