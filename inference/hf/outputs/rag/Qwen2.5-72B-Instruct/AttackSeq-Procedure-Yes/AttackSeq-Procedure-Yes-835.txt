### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that WinDealer will steal information from SNS (Social Networking Service) applications, encrypt this data using AES, and then communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers using non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection by network security systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the application layer to communicate with C2 servers, which can also help evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Information from SNS Applications:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a common tactic for malware to steal information from various applications, including SNS applications.
   - **Encrypting Data Using AES:**
     - Encrypting data before exfiltration is a common practice to protect the data from being intercepted and read by network security tools.
   - **Communicating with C2 Servers Using Non-Standard Ports:**
     - The related TTP T1571-Non-Standard Port directly supports this part of the question. Using non-standard ports is a known technique to evade detection.
   - **Using Non-Application Layer Protocols:**
     - The related TTP T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol also supports the idea of using non-standard communication methods to evade detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs provide strong evidence that WinDealer is likely to use non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols for C2 communication. While the specific mention of stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting data using AES is not directly supported by the TTPs, these are common practices in malware operations and are consistent with the overall behavior described.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
