### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Tropic Trooper group after gaining initial access.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
     - Downloading and installing an MSI package.
     - Dropping a backdoor installer.
     - Preparing for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe.
     - Achieving persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs**
     - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download or upload files and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications (like Microsoft Office) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs**
     - This technique involves using BITS to evade detection by performing file transfers in a stealthy manner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor, which aligns with T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
   - **Downloading and Installing an MSI Package:**
     - This step is a common method for installing malware and aligns with the initial access and execution phases.
   - **Dropping a Backdoor Installer:**
     - This is a logical next step after gaining initial access and installing the MSI package.
   - **Preparing for Execution of the BITSadmin Command-Line Tool:**
     - This aligns with T1197-BITS Jobs, which is used for both persistence and defense evasion.
   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - Loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers is a common method for maintaining persistence, which aligns with T1197-BITS Jobs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The use of BITS for both persistence and defense evasion, along with the initial exploitation and installation of the backdoor, fits the typical attack pattern of Tropic Trooper.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
