### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malicious documents are used to gain initial access, and the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word. It then asks if it is likely that the shellcode in winword.exe resolved libraries and APIs, downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document, and executed them using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native API calls to execute code. This is relevant because the question mentions resolving libraries and APIs.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves using malicious files to gain initial access. This aligns with the use of malicious documents to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into templates, which is relevant to the injection of the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs:
       - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** Malicious documents are used to gain initial access.
       - **T1221-Template Injection:** The Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
       - **T1106-Native API:** The shellcode in winword.exe resolves libraries and APIs, which is a common technique for executing code and downloading payloads.
     - The use of CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA() to execute the second-stage payload and a decoy document is a plausible and common method in such attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the described sequence of events is unlikely, which does not align with the related TTPs and the typical behavior of such attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question, and it aligns well with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
