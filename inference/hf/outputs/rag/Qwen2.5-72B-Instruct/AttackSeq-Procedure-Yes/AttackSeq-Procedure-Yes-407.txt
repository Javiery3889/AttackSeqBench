### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a malicious Excel file attached to a phishing email contained a macro to display a fake invoice while running malicious code to install ISMAgent, specifically in the context of the OilRig campaign.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002 - Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a file that contains malicious code. The file could be an Excel file with a macro.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code. The attachment could be a malicious Excel file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malicious Excel file contained a macro to display a fake invoice while running malicious code to install ISMAgent.
     - The related TTPs support this scenario:
       - **T1204.002 - Malicious File:** The Excel file with a macro is a common method for executing malicious code.
       - **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment:** The phishing email with the attachment aligns with the initial access method.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the scenario described is not likely.
     - However, the related TTPs provide strong evidence that this scenario is plausible and consistent with known attack patterns.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the OilRig campaign, it is likely that the malicious Excel file contained a macro to display a fake invoice while running malicious code to install ISMAgent.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
