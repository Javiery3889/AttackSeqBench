### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack:
     - An APT phishing email was sent.
     - The email contained a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
     - A VBScript was downloaded and opened a .doc file.
     - The .doc file led to the execution of the malware.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to run commands and scripts, making it a common tool for attackers to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the malicious code more difficult to detect. Base64 encoding is a common method used to obfuscate code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code. PowerShell is often used to execute encoded commands to evade detection. The technique T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) supports this, as base64 encoding is a common method for obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice suggests that it is not likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code. However, given the context and the related TTPs, this is less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
