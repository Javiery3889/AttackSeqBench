### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor, after exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication, will shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot:** This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system to cause a denial of service (DoS) or to disrupt operations.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack or to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.
     - The related TTP T1529 (System Shutdown/Reboot) is directly relevant to this choice, as it describes a technique that can be used to disrupt operations and impact system availability.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.
     - While T1070.004 (File Deletion) is a relevant technique for defense evasion, it does not directly address the question of system shutdown.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of the backdoor shutting down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.
   - The related TTP T1529 (System Shutdown/Reboot) directly supports the idea that shutting down the system is a plausible action to achieve the goal of disrupting operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor will indeed shut down the victim's computer to achieve the desired impact.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
