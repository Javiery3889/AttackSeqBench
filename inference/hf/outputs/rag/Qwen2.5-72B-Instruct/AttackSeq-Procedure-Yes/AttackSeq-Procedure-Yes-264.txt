### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will execute RATs (Remote Access Trojans) entirely in memory to avoid disk interaction and evade traditional antivirus detection after delivering the RAT payload via email attachments or by tricking users into downloading files, but before maintaining persistence by creating a registry key pointing to PerfWatson.exe and nvSCPAPISrv.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.010-Regsvr32:** This technique involves using the legitimate Windows utility `regsvr32.exe` to execute arbitrary code, which can be used to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, often via email attachments or social engineering.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique involves executing code entirely in memory to avoid leaving traces on the disk, which can help evade traditional antivirus detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique aligns with the initial step of delivering the RAT payload via email attachments or by tricking users into downloading files.
   - **T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique aligns with the step of executing the RAT entirely in memory to avoid disk interaction and evade traditional antivirus detection.
   - **T1218.010-Regsvr32:** This technique can be used to maintain persistence by creating a registry key, which is mentioned in the question as the final step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because it follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. **Initial Delivery:** The attackers use social engineering to trick users into opening a malicious file (T1204.002).
     2. **Execution in Memory:** The RAT is executed entirely in memory to avoid detection (T1027.011).
     3. **Persistence:** The attackers create a registry key to maintain persistence (T1218.010).
