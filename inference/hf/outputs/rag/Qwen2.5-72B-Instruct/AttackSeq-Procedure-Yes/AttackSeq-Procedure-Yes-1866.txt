### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a malicious document using the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands is likely to contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to control a compromised system. The initial stage might involve a simple command to download or execute a more complex payload, which then communicates with a control server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or scripts, often to invoke PowerShell or other command-line tools to perform malicious actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malicious document will indeed contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.
     - Given the use of DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands, it is plausible that the initial execution is part of a multi-stage attack. The encoded commands could include instructions to contact a control server to download and execute the first-stage Seduploader malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malicious document will not contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.
     - This is less likely because the use of DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands is often a precursor to further malicious activities, including contacting a control server for additional payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the nature of the attack described, the most plausible sequence is that the malicious document will contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
