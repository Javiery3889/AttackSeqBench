### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller using an Internet Explorer zero-day for initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attack group will:
     - Adopt and customize several Android backdoors.
     - Utilize a massive infrastructure for Command and Control (C2).
     - Deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:**
     - This technique involves the development and use of malware, which is consistent with the use of a zero-day exploit and the potential for deploying backdoors.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors, which aligns with the watering hole attack described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of a watering hole attack and a zero-day exploit (T1189) is a sophisticated and targeted method for gaining initial access. This is consistent with the capabilities of a well-resourced and advanced attack group.
   - **Adopting and Customizing Android Backdoors:**
     - While the initial attack targets a software reseller using a web browser (Internet Explorer), the question suggests that the attack group might also target Android devices. This is plausible if the attack group is highly sophisticated and has a broad range of targets, including mobile devices.
   - **Utilizing a Massive Infrastructure for C2:**
     - Advanced attack groups often use a large and complex infrastructure for C2 to maintain persistence and evade detection. This is a common practice for sophisticated threat actors.
   - **Deploying Second-Stage Backdoors with Hardcoded Proxy Addresses and Credentials:**
     - Deploying second-stage backdoors is a common tactic to maintain long-term access to a compromised network. Hardcoding proxy addresses and credentials can be a method to ensure reliable communication and control over the compromised systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the initial attack (watering hole and zero-day exploit) and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the attack group would adopt and customize several Android backdoors, utilize a massive infrastructure for C2, and deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
