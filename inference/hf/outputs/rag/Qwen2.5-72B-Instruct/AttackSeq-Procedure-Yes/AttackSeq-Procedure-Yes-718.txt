### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant, after performing initial reconnaissance, is likely to communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP) to communicate with command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Rising Sun implant, after performing initial reconnaissance, would likely need to communicate with a C2 server to receive further commands or to exfiltrate the collected data.
     - The related TTP T1071.001 (Web Protocols) specifically mentions the use of HTTP for C2 communication, which aligns with the question.
     - The related TTP T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) further supports the idea that the same channel used for C2 can be used for exfiltration, which is consistent with the use of HTTP POST requests.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that the Rising Sun implant does not use HTTP POST requests for C2 communication, which contradicts the related TTP T1071.001.
     - It also does not align with the common practice of using web protocols for C2 communication in many malware implants.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in malware communication, the most plausible answer is that the Rising Sun implant would use HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
