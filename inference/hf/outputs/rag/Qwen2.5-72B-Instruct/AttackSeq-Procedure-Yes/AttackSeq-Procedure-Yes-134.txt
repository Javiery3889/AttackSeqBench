### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS gains initial access using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory without being written to the hard disk, followed by the use of multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including executing Shellcode in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts is a common technique for gaining initial access. Shellcode is often used to establish a foothold on a system by executing malicious code.
   - **In-Memory Execution:**
     - Shellcode can be executed directly in memory without being written to the hard disk. This is a common tactic to evade detection by security software that monitors file writes.
   - **Multi-Beacon Communication:**
     - After gaining initial access and executing the Shellcode in memory, attackers often use multi-beacon communication to maintain persistence and evade detection. This involves setting up multiple communication channels to ensure that the connection remains active even if one channel is detected or blocked.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory without being written to the hard disk, followed by the use of multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
