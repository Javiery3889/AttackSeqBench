### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will query the registry and identify victim machines as part of its discovery process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves the malware querying the registry to gather information about the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This technique involves the malware removing or modifying its persistence mechanisms to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware has already achieved persistence by adding files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable. This is a common tactic to ensure the malware runs at system startup and to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - After achieving persistence and evading defenses, it is common for malware to perform discovery to understand the environment it is operating in. This helps the malware to identify the victim machine's configuration, installed software, and other relevant information.
   - **Query Registry (T1012):**
     - Querying the registry is a common discovery technique. It allows the malware to gather detailed information about the system, such as installed software, system configuration, and user settings. This information can be used to further the attack, such as identifying potential targets for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the malware will query the registry and identify victim machines as part of its discovery process. This aligns with the common behavior of malware after achieving persistence and evading defenses.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
