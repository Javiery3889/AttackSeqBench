### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the communication method Stuxnet uses after exploiting specific vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) for lateral movement.
   - The focus is on whether Stuxnet communicates with its C&C servers using encrypted channels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network. The MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities are examples of such exploits.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route C&C traffic. It can be used to obfuscate the communication and make it harder to detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Stuxnet is known for its sophisticated nature and the use of advanced techniques to avoid detection. Using encrypted channels for C&C communication is a common practice in advanced malware to protect the communication from being intercepted or analyzed.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Stuxnet uses unencrypted channels for C&C communication, which is less likely given the advanced nature of Stuxnet and the importance of maintaining stealth and security in its operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Stuxnet and the use of advanced techniques to avoid detection, it is highly likely that Stuxnet would use encrypted channels for C&C communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
