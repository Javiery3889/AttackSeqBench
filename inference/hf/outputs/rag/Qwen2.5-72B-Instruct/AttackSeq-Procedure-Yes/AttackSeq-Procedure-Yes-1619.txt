### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access and then executes a dropper to enable system compromise.
   - The question then asks whether APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear phishing with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - APT28 is known to use spear phishing with malicious attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access to a target system.
     - Once initial access is gained, they often use a dropper to execute additional malware, which can enable further system compromise.
   - **Discovery Process:**
     - After gaining access and executing the dropper, the next step in the attack lifecycle is often the discovery process, where the attacker explores the network to understand the environment.
     - APT28, like many advanced threat actors, often uses command and control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with compromised systems.
     - However, the question specifically asks about the use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process.
   - **Geographically Distributed Bots:**
     - While APT28 does use sophisticated C2 infrastructure, the use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server is more characteristic of botnets and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
     - APT28 typically uses more targeted and controlled C2 methods to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, APT28 is less likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process. Instead, they are more likely to use more controlled and stealthy C2 methods.

**Final Answer: B: No**
