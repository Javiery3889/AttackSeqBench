### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant, after ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder, is likely to perform initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information (discovery) before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system's network configuration, including IP addresses, network adapter details, and other network-related information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves the use of multiple stages of communication channels to maintain command and control over the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This sub-technique is a specific method of discovering whether the system has an active internet connection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will perform initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information before communicating with control servers.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** and **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery** are both discovery techniques that involve gathering network-related information.
       - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** indicates that the implant uses multiple stages of communication, which aligns with the idea of performing initial reconnaissance before establishing command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not perform initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information before communicating with control servers.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which clearly indicate that network discovery is a common and logical step before establishing command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the Rising Sun implant will perform initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information before communicating with control servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
