### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10, after conducting internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools, is likely to identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which is a common step in internal reconnaissance.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration by staging it on a remote system, often using compression tools to make the data more manageable.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which is another step in internal reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 will indeed identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** and **T1046-Network Service Discovery** are both part of the Discovery phase, where the attacker maps out the network and identifies systems of interest.
       - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging** is part of the Collection phase, where the attacker prepares data for exfiltration by staging it on a remote system, often using compression tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 will not follow this sequence.
     - However, the related TTPs indicate that the sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern for APT10.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible answer is that APT10 will indeed identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
