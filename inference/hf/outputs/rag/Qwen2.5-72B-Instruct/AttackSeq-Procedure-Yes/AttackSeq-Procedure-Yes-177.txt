### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Infamous Chisel malware, after executing shell scripts as the root user for privilege escalation, is likely to persist on the system by replacing the legitimate `netd` system binary, checking if `init` is the parent process, and executing the legitimate process backed up at `/system/bin/netd_`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1037.004-RC Scripts:**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating scripts that are executed during system startup or user logon to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell:**
     - This technique involves using Unix shell commands to execute other commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.009-Break Process Trees:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the parent-child relationship of processes to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1037.004-RC Scripts):**
     - The malware has already executed shell scripts as the root user for privilege escalation, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Execution (T1059.004-Unix Shell):**
     - The use of shell scripts to execute commands is consistent with the execution of the malware.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036.009-Break Process Trees):**
     - The question mentions checking if `init` is the parent process and executing the legitimate process backed up at `/system/bin/netd_`. This is a technique to break process trees and evade detection, which aligns with the defense evasion tactic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (replacing the `netd` binary, checking the parent process, and executing the legitimate process) is a plausible method for the malware to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - The related TTPs support the likelihood of this sequence occurring.
