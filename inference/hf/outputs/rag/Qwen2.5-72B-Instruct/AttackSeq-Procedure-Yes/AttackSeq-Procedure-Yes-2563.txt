### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Shellbot is likely to establish C&C (Command and Control) communication using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel after gathering system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
   - This TTP indicates that the malware (Shellbot) is gathering information about the infected host, such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** This technique is used by malware to gather information about the system it has infected. This information can be used to determine the best course of action, such as whether to proceed with further stages of the attack or to avoid detection.
   - **C&C Communication:** Establishing C&C communication is a critical step in many malware operations, allowing the attacker to control the infected host and execute commands remotely.
   - **IRC Channels:** IRC channels have historically been used by some malware, including certain botnets, to establish C&C communication. However, the use of IRC has become less common in recent years due to increased detection and mitigation efforts.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This would imply that Shellbot is likely to use an IRC channel for C&C communication after gathering system information.
   - **B: No:** This would imply that Shellbot is unlikely to use an IRC channel for C&C communication after gathering system information.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While Shellbot might gather system information to understand the environment it is operating in, the use of IRC for C&C communication is less common in modern malware. More sophisticated and stealthy methods, such as HTTPS, DNS, or other encrypted protocols, are often used to avoid detection.
   - Given the context of the related TTP (T1082-System Information Discovery), which focuses on gathering information rather than establishing C&C, and the general trend away from IRC in modern malware, it is less likely that Shellbot would use an IRC channel for C&C communication.

### Final Answer: B: No
