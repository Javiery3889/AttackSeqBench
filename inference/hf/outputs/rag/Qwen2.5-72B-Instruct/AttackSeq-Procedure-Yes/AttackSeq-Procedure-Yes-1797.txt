### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained by exploiting a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119).
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Adobe Flash Player) to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which is then executed by a legitimate program. This is a common method for evading defenses and maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 for initial access aligns with the T1203 technique.
   - **DLL Sideloading:**
     - The use of a dropper executable (Rdws.exe) for DLL sideloading aligns with the T1574.002 technique.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question (exploiting the vulnerability, using a dropper executable for DLL sideloading, and then deploying a malicious DLL) is a plausible and common attack pattern.
     - The dropper executable (Rdws.exe) is often used to deliver and execute the malicious DLL, which is then loaded by a legitimate program to evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, it is likely that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
