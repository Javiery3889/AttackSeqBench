### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions that ComboJack might take after ensuring persistence and hiding itself.
   - The specific actions in question are:
     - Entering an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information.
     - Replacing legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address.
     - Attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system. This is relevant to the initial steps of ensuring persistence.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which is directly related to the action of checking clipboard contents for wallet information.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves setting registry keys or using startup folders to ensure that the malware runs at system startup, which is relevant to the persistence mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Hiding:**
     - The malware has already ensured persistence by setting a registry key (T1547.001) and hiding itself using `attrib.exe`.
   - **Clipboard Data Collection:**
     - The next logical step would be to collect data from the clipboard (T1115) to monitor for wallet information.
   - **Infinite Loop and Wallet Address Replacement:**
     - Once the malware is monitoring the clipboard, it can enter an infinite loop to continuously check for wallet information.
     - When it finds a wallet address, it can replace it with a hardcoded address and attempt to redirect funds to the attacker.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that ComboJack would enter an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information, replace legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address, and attempt to redirect funds to the attacker.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
