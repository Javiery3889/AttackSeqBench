### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence involves using an LNK file to execute a JavaScript file.
   - The JavaScript file is then expected to copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence.
   - Finally, it is expected to add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves using the startup folder to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and then add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
     - The related TTPs support this sequence:
       - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique aligns with copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
       - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique aligns with adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence is not likely.
     - However, the related TTPs provide strong evidence that both actions (copying to the startup directory and adding to scheduled tasks) are common techniques used for persistence and execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence, it is plausible that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
