### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that before APT34's campaign utilized DNS tunneling for evasion, the malicious macros within the Word document performed specific actions such as verifying a mouse connection for anti-sandboxing, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to tunnel C2 traffic, which can include DNS tunneling.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique specifically involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Verifying a Mouse Connection for Anti-Sandboxing:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to detect if it is running in a sandbox environment. If the malware detects a sandbox, it may alter its behavior or terminate to avoid detection.
   - **Communicating with the C2 Server:**
     - The related TTPs (T1572 and T1071.004) indicate that DNS tunneling is used for C2 communication. This suggests that the malware would indeed communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Dropping an Embedded Executable with a '.doc' Extension:**
     - Dropping an executable with a '.doc' extension is a plausible action for a Word document macro. This could be a way to disguise the malicious payload and trick the user into executing it.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common practices in malware, it is plausible that the malicious macros within the Word document would perform the actions described in the question. The sequence of verifying a mouse connection for anti-sandboxing, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension aligns with typical APT34 behavior and the use of DNS tunneling for C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
