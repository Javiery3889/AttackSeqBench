### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether WinDealer, after processing and encrypting stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase, is likely to communicate with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA as part of its command and control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography (RSA) to encrypt communication between the malware and the C2 server. This is often used to protect the confidentiality of the communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the exfiltration of data over the same channel used for command and control communication. This is a common method to avoid detection by using a single, established communication channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will use an AES key encrypted with RSA for C2 communication.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is plausible. The use of asymmetric cryptography (RSA) to encrypt the AES key is a common practice to ensure secure communication. The exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) aligns with the idea that the same channel used for C2 communication is also used for data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will not use an AES key encrypted with RSA for C2 communication.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs. The use of asymmetric cryptography (T1573.002) is a standard practice in secure C2 communication, and the exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) supports the idea of using a single, secure communication channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in malware communication, the most plausible answer is that WinDealer will use an AES key encrypted with RSA for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
