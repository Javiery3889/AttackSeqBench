### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the lightSpy malware performing data collection from various sources, including hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that lightSpy leverages hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the data collection activities described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves discovering and collecting information from the browser, which also aligns with the browser history collection mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which can include contacts and messenger app data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The related TTPs confirm that lightSpy is performing data collection from various sources, which is consistent with the question.
   - The question also asks about the use of hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.
   - Hardcoded C&C server locations are a common technique used by malware to maintain communication with the attacker's infrastructure. This is a plausible method for lightSpy to use for module updates and data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the related TTPs and the common practice of using hardcoded C&C server locations in malware, it is likely that lightSpy leverages hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
