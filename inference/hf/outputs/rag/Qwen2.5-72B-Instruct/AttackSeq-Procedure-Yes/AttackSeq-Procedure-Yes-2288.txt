### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is achieved through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - It then asks whether the DNSpionage malware requires human interaction to execute payloads before maintaining persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves adversaries creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute their payloads at a specific time or under certain conditions.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves adversaries tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:**
     - The use of spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique. This typically requires human interaction to open the document and execute the embedded malicious code.
   - **Execution of Payloads:**
     - Once the malicious document is opened, the payload (DNSpionage malware) is executed. This step does require human interaction to open the document.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - After the initial execution, the malware can create a scheduled task to maintain persistence. This is described by the T1053.005-Scheduled Task technique. The creation of the scheduled task does not require human interaction once the initial payload is executed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks if human interaction is required to execute payloads before maintaining persistence. Based on the analysis, human interaction is required to open the malicious document and execute the initial payload, but not for the creation of the scheduled task for persistence.
   - Therefore, the answer is "Yes" because human interaction is required to execute the initial payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
