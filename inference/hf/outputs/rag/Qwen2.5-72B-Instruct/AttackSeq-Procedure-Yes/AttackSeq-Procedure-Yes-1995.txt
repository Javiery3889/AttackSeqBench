### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an actor named SkinnyBoy.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Discovery activities: Extracting the volume serial number and enumerating user-specific directories and AppData folders.
     - Automating the collection of data using the `CryptBinaryToStringA` API for encoding.
     - Sending the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the final step of sending the collected information to the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which aligns with the extraction of the volume serial number.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves enumerating files and directories, which aligns with the enumeration of user-specific directories and AppData folders.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The related TTPs T1082 and T1083 clearly support the discovery activities described in the question.
   - **Data Collection and Encoding:**
     - The question mentions using the `CryptBinaryToStringA` API for encoding the collected data. While this specific API is not directly mentioned in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is a common practice in malware to encode data before exfiltration to avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The related TTP T1041 supports the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the final step of sending the collected information via an HTTP POST request.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that SkinnyBoy would automate the collection of data using the `CryptBinaryToStringA` API for encoding before sending the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
