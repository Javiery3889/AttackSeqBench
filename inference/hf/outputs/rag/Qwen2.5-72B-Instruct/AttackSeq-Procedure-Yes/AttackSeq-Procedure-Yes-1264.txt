### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`), and then actions are taken to maintain persistence.
   - The final part of the question asks whether the final PowerShell script will likely lead to njRAT establishing command and control over the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating commands to avoid detection by security tools. Obfuscation can make it difficult for defenders to understand the true nature of the commands being executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the final PowerShell script will lead to njRAT establishing command and control over the victim's computer.
     - Given the context of the related TTPs, it is plausible that the obfuscated batch script and the PowerShell script are part of a larger attack chain. njRAT is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that can be delivered via PowerShell scripts to establish command and control (C2) over a victim's computer.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the final PowerShell script will not lead to njRAT establishing command and control over the victim's computer.
     - While it is possible that the PowerShell script could perform other actions, the combination of obfuscation and the use of PowerShell for execution strongly suggests that the script is part of a malicious attack chain, which often includes establishing C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the nature of the described attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the final PowerShell script will lead to njRAT establishing command and control over the victim's computer.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
