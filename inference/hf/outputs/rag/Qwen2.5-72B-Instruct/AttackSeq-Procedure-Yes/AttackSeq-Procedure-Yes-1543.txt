### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT42 is likely to perform privilege escalation by deploying custom malware capable of logging keystrokes and stealing browser logins and cookie data after using template injection and obfuscating files or information for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves logging keystrokes to capture sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:** This technique involves stealing web session cookies to gain unauthorized access to web sessions.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is listed again, emphasizing the importance of keylogging in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Template Injection and Obfuscation:**
     - Template injection is a technique used to inject malicious code into a template, which can then be executed to perform various actions.
     - Obfuscation is used to make the malicious code harder to detect and analyze by security tools.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system, which can be achieved through various means, including deploying custom malware.
   - **Keylogging and Stealing Web Session Cookies:**
     - Keylogging and stealing web session cookies are techniques used to collect sensitive information and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
     - These techniques are often used in the context of credential access and collection, which are common goals for APT groups.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that APT42 is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks, it is plausible that after using template injection and obfuscation for defense evasion, they would deploy custom malware to perform keylogging and steal web session cookies.
   - The related TTPs strongly support the use of keylogging and stealing web session cookies, which are consistent with the goals of privilege escalation and credential access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
