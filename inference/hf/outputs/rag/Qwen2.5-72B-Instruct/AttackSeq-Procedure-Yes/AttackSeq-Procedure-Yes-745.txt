### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access is gained by tricking users into downloading a fake app.
     - The malware downloader is involved.
     - The RAT 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):**
     - This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1543.003 - Windows Service (Persistence):**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to execute malicious code.
   - **T1204.002 - Malicious File (Execution):**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained by tricking users into downloading a fake app (T1204.002 - Malicious File).
   - **Malware Downloader:**
     - Once the fake app is downloaded and executed, a malware downloader is likely to be involved. This downloader is responsible for downloading and executing additional malicious binaries.
   - **Execution of Binaries:**
     - The malware downloader will typically execute these binaries to perform various tasks, such as downloading and installing the RAT.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The RAT 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service (T1543.003 - Windows Service) to maintain persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is likely to be:
     1. The user is tricked into downloading and executing the fake app (T1204.002).
     2. The malware downloader is activated and executes additional binaries.
     3. One of these binaries is the RAT 'IvizTech', which is then installed and executed as a service (T1543.003).

   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service.
