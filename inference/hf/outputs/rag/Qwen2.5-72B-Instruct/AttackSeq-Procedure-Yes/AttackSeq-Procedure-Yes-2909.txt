### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether threat actors are likely to use the AtomBombing technique to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC)**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process by queuing an APC to the target process's thread. This can be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the target process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process. This can be used to evade detection by security products and to perform actions with the privileges of the target process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **AtomBombing Technique:**
     - AtomBombing is a method of code injection that leverages the Windows atom tables to inject code into a process. It is known for its ability to bypass certain security mechanisms and execute code in the context of a target process.
   - **Process Injection (T1055):**
     - Process injection is a common technique used by threat actors to execute code in the context of a trusted process. This can help evade detection by security products and gain higher privileges.
   - **Asynchronous Procedure Call (T1055.004):**
     - APC is a specific method of process injection that can be used to execute code in the context of a target process's thread. It is often used in conjunction with other techniques to achieve code execution and privilege escalation.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The AtomBombing technique is a form of code injection that can be used to execute code in the context of a target process.
   - Once the code is executed, threat actors often use process injection techniques like APC (T1055.004) to further evade detection and perform actions with the privileges of the target process.
   - The related TTPs (T1055 and T1055.004) align with the idea of using code injection to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products.
