### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. The backdoor program gathers host information during the discovery phase.
     2. It establishes communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling.
     3. It parses the returned data, extracting commands from the C2 server.
     4. It distributes the commands through the taskHandler function.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Command and Control**
     - **Technique: T1071.004-DNS** (DNS Tunneling)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question mentions that the backdoor program gathers host information during the discovery phase. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **DNS Tunneling:**
     - The related TTP T1071.004-DNS indicates that DNS tunneling is a technique used for command and control (C2) communication. DNS tunneling involves encoding data in DNS queries and responses to establish a covert channel for communication.
   - **Parsing and Command Execution:**
     - After establishing communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling, the backdoor program would need to parse the returned data to extract commands. This is a logical next step in the attack sequence.
   - **TaskHandler Function:**
     - The taskHandler function is responsible for distributing the commands to the appropriate modules or functions within the backdoor program. This is a common approach in malware to modularize and manage the execution of commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor program is likely to establish communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling, parse the returned data, and distribute the commands through the taskHandler function.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
