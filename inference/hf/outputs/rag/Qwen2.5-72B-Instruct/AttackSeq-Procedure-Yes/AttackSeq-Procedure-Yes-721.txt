### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to fetch computer name and user name information (discovery activities) before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests (command and control).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with control servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves checking for an active internet connection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system owner and user information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information before communicating with control servers.
     - The related TTPs include both discovery techniques (T1016.001 and T1033) and command and control techniques (T1071.001).
     - It is common for malware to perform discovery activities to gather information about the compromised system before establishing communication with control servers. This information can be used to tailor the attack or to provide context to the command and control server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not fetch computer name and user name information before communicating with control servers.
     - This is less likely given the presence of the discovery techniques in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware, it is more plausible that the Rising Sun implant will perform discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
