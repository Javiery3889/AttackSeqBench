### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Milestone backdoor, which ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
   - It then asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system files or directories to avoid detection.
   - **T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification:** This technique involves modifying the code signing policy to allow the execution of unsigned or malicious code.
   - **T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to change system behavior, such as creating or modifying registry keys to ensure persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Registry Modification (T1112):** The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry. This aligns with the T1112 technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036.005 and T1553.006):** The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using DKOM. The related TTPs T1036.005 and T1553.006 are not directly related to DKOM but are related to other forms of Defense Evasion.
   - **DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Modification):** DKOM is a sophisticated technique used to manipulate kernel objects to hide processes, files, or network connections. It is a form of Defense Evasion but is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Milestone backdoor has already established persistence and modified the registry, which are common initial steps in an attack.
   - Deploying a kernel rootkit like Fire Chili for DKOM is a more advanced and sophisticated step that is typically used to maintain stealth and evade detection.
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Deep Panda would use such advanced techniques to further evade defenses and maintain control over the system.
