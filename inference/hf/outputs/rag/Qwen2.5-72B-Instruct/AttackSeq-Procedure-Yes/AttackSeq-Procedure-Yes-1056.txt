### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations after performing reconnaissance and before gaining initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1591.002 - Business Relationships):** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's business relationships, which can include travel plans and other details that can be used to tailor attacks.
   - **Initial Access (T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain):** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malware to the victim.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location):** This technique involves making malicious files or directories appear legitimate by matching their names or locations to those of legitimate software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1591.002 - Business Relationships):** This is the first step in the sequence, where the APT group gathers detailed information about the victim's business relationships and travel plans.
   - **Compromise Software Supply Chain (T1195.002):** After gathering the necessary information, the APT group is likely to compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations. This involves gaining access to the software supply chain to deliver malware.
   - **Match Legitimate Name or Location (T1036.005):** This technique is used to make the malware appear legitimate, which is a crucial step in the initial access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs. The APT group performs reconnaissance to gather detailed information, then compromises trusted commercial network resources to support their operations, and finally gains initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
