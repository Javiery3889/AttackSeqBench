### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gamaredon, after gaining initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures, is likely to execute a macro code that runs a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe' before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder files to execute a program when a user logs in.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBScript) to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that Gamaredon gains initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures. This is a common initial access vector.
   - **Execution of Macro Code:**
     - Malicious documents often contain macros that, when enabled, can execute additional code. In this case, the macro code runs a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe'.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After executing the VBScript, the group is likely to establish persistence to ensure the malware remains active even after the system is restarted. Registering a RUN key in the Windows registry is a common method for achieving this.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The group first gains initial access, then executes a macro code to run a VBScript, and finally achieves persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
