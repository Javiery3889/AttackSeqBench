### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug malware, after collecting data from local systems and removable media, is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, such as files and system information.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can be encrypted and use custom protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that Korplug malware collects data from local systems and removable media, which aligns with the T1005 and T1025 techniques.
   - The question also mentions that the malware gathers data from network shared drives, which is not explicitly listed in the related TTPs but is a common step in the collection phase.
   - The final step in the question is data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol, which aligns with the T1041 technique (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the related TTPs cover the collection of data from local systems and removable media, and the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, it is reasonable to conclude that Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
