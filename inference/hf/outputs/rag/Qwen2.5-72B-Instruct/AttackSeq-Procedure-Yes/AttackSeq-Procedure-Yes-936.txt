### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a backdoor program will establish communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server via DNS tunneling after gathering host information and successfully evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Command and Control**
     - **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
   - **T1071.004-DNS** is a sub-technique under the Command and Control tactic, which describes the use of DNS (Domain Name System) for communication between a compromised system and a C2 server. DNS tunneling is a method where attackers use DNS queries and responses to exfiltrate data or receive commands from a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the backdoor program will use DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server.
     - Given the related TTPs, this is a plausible scenario. DNS tunneling is a common technique used by attackers to establish covert communication channels, especially when other communication methods might be monitored or blocked.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the backdoor program will use DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server.
     - This is less plausible given the related TTPs, which specifically mention DNS tunneling as a technique under Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of DNS tunneling in C2 communications, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor program will indeed establish communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
