### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the Tuyul malware might follow after exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
   - Specifically, it asks if the malware will execute Perl scripts and shell commands before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs to execute commands or scripts at specific times, which is a method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:** This reinforces the use of cron jobs for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell:** This technique involves executing commands through a Unix shell, which can be used to run scripts or commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The question states that the initial access is gained through exploiting CVE-2017-9841 on unpatched PHPUnit systems. This is a known vulnerability that can be exploited to gain initial access.
   - **Execution of Perl Scripts and Shell Commands:** The related TTPs include T1059.004-Unix Shell, which indicates that the malware can execute commands through a Unix shell. This supports the idea that the malware might execute Perl scripts and shell commands.
   - **Periodic Downloading of 'cron' Script:** The related TTPs also include T1053.003-Cron, which is used for maintaining persistence by scheduling tasks. This supports the idea that the malware might periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, it is plausible that the Tuyul malware will execute Perl scripts and shell commands before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
