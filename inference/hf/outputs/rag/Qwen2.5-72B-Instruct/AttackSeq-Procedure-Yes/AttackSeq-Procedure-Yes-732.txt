### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Iranian state-backed hackers used phishing attacks to gain initial access by targeting individuals involved in sanctions against Iran.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the hackers tailored their targeting approach by gathering information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's organization, which can include details about the organization's structure, employees, and operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing attacks to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather specific information about the victim, such as personal details, contacts, and activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the hackers did gather detailed information about the victims.
     - The related TTPs support this choice:
       - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique aligns with gathering information about the victim's organization, which can include cyber knowledge, contacts, and activities.
       - **T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique specifically involves using phishing to gather detailed information about the victim, which can include working time and geographic location.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the hackers did not gather detailed information about the victims.
     - The related TTPs do not support this choice, as both T1591 and T1598 involve gathering information about the victim.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is highly likely that the hackers tailored their targeting approach by gathering detailed information about the victims.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
