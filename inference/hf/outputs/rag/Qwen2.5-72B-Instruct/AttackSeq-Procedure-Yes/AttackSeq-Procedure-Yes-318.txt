### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether W32.Flamer, after disabling unnecessary logging and securely deleting log files for defense evasion, is likely to archive collected data by encrypting it with a public key before uploading it to the C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This sub-technique involves using a custom method to archive the data, which could include encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Disabling Logging and Securely Deleting Log Files:** These actions are part of defense evasion tactics (T1070-Indicator Removal on Host) to avoid detection.
   - **Archiving Collected Data:** The related TTPs indicate that W32.Flamer is likely to archive collected data, which is a common step in the exfiltration process.
   - **Encrypting with a Public Key:** The sub-technique T1560.003 mentions using a custom method to archive data, which could include encryption. Encrypting data with a public key is a common method to ensure that only the intended recipient (the C&C server) can decrypt and access the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the common practice of encrypting data before exfiltration to ensure confidentiality, it is likely that W32.Flamer will archive collected data by encrypting it with a public key before uploading it to the C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
