### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a phishing email containing a ZIP file.
   - The next steps involve executing a PowerShell script from the Internet and then ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time or in response to certain events.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder shortcuts to ensure that malicious code runs when a user logs in or the system starts up.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Phishing Email):** The attack starts with a phishing email containing a ZIP file. This is a common initial access vector.
   - **Execution of PowerShell Script:** After the user opens the ZIP file, it is plausible that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute additional malicious code.
   - **Persistence via Startup Folder and Scheduled Tasks:** Once the malicious code is executed, the next logical step is to ensure persistence. This can be achieved by creating startup folder shortcuts or scheduled tasks, as described in the related TTPs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (phishing email, execution of PowerShell script, and ensuring persistence) aligns well with the related TTPs.
   - The execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet is a common technique used to download and run additional malicious code.
   - Ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks is a logical next step to maintain access to the compromised system.
