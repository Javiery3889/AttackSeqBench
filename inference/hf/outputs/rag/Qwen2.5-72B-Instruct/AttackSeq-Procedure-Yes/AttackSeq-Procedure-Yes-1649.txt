### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials during the reconnaissance phase, following an attack that leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves the collection of credentials, such as usernames and passwords, during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves the use of domain properties, such as domain names, to support various stages of an attack, including reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique aligns with the idea of gathering user credentials, which is a common goal during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique suggests that the attackers might use phishing domains to trick users into providing their credentials. Phishing domains are often used in phishing campaigns to mimic legitimate websites and trick users into entering their credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attack group leveraged an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8 for initial access, it is plausible that they also used phishing domains to gather user credentials during the reconnaissance phase. Phishing domains are a common method for credential harvesting, and the use of such domains aligns with the T1590.001 technique.
   - The combination of T1589.001 (gathering credentials) and T1590.001 (using domain properties) strongly supports the idea that the attack group likely used phishing domains to gather user credentials.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
