### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion after disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names, and before utilizing command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming malware files to match legitimate files or placing them in legitimate locations to avoid detection.
   - **T1553.002 - Code Signing:** This technique involves using digital signatures to make malware appear more trustworthy.
   - **T1036 - Masquerading:** This is a broader technique that includes T1036.005 and involves various methods to make malware appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This is the first step in the sequence, where attackers disguise malware files with legitimate-looking names.
   - **T1553.002 - Code Signing:** After disguising the files, attackers might use untrusted and faked digital signatures to further evade detection. This is a logical next step because it adds an additional layer of trust to the malware.
   - **C2 Infrastructure with Changing and Static IPs on DynDNS:** This is typically a later step in the attack sequence, where the malware establishes communication with the attacker's server. This step is necessary for the attacker to control the malware and exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (disguising files, using faked digital signatures, and then setting up C2 infrastructure) is a common and logical progression in many cyber attacks.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, as they cover the steps of masquerading and code signing, which are both used for defense evasion.
