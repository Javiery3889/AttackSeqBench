### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TA505 is likely to encode the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry as part of defense evasion after hijacking the RegIdleBackup scheduled task and altering its COM handler.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the attacker is using a scheduled task for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This suggests that the attacker might use encoding or encryption to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This reinforces the use of a scheduled task for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that TA505 is likely to encode the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry.
     - The related TTP T1027.013 (Encrypted/Encoded File) supports this, as it indicates that encoding is a common technique for defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TA505 is not likely to encode the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTP T1027.013, which suggests that encoding is a common technique for defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of encoding for defense evasion, the most plausible answer is that TA505 is likely to encode the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
