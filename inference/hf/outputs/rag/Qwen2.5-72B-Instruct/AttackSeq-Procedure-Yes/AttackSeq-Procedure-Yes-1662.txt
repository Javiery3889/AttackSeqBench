### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlueBravo's malware has gathered detailed system information.
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to use HTTPS for C2 communication, Microsoft OneDrive, and potentially DropBox for bidirectional communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols, such as HTTPS, for command and control (C2) communication. HTTPS is a common and secure protocol used to mask C2 traffic.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves using legitimate cloud services, such as Microsoft OneDrive and DropBox, for bidirectional communication. These services are often used to exfiltrate data and receive commands from the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The malware gathering system information is a common initial step in many attacks.
     - Using HTTPS for C2 communication is a common and effective method to avoid detection, as it blends in with normal web traffic.
     - Using cloud services like Microsoft OneDrive and DropBox for bidirectional communication is also a known technique to exfiltrate data and receive commands, as these services are often trusted and less likely to be blocked by network security measures.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the malware does not use these common and effective methods for C2 communication, which is less likely given the context of the related TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in malware communication, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware uses HTTPS for C2 communication and cloud services like Microsoft OneDrive and DropBox for bidirectional communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
