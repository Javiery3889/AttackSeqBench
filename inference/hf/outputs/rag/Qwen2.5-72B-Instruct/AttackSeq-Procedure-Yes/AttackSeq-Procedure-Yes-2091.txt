### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already discovered and mapped the internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon and have collected administrative-level credentials.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to the network. The fact that the attackers have collected administrative-level credentials aligns with this technique.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within the network to facilitate lateral movement. This is a common step after gaining initial access and collecting credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that the attackers have already mapped the network and collected administrative-level credentials, it is highly likely that they will use these credentials to move laterally across the infrastructure. The technique T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) supports this by indicating that the attackers will transfer tools to other systems to gain access and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer choice suggests that the attackers will not move laterally. However, this is less likely given the context. Once attackers have administrative credentials and have mapped the network, lateral movement is a common and logical next step to expand their control and access within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
