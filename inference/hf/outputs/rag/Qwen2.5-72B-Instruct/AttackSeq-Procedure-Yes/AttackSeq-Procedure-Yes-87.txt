### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malware, after gathering information about the infected computer (system and user names), will collect keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents, and then transmit this data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include various types of files and information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed collect keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents and transmit them through encrypted emails.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **T1005-Data from Local System** aligns with the collection of various types of data, including keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents.
       - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** aligns with the discovery of files and directories, which is a necessary step before collecting and exfiltrating data.
       - The use of encrypted emails for transmission is a plausible method for exfiltrating data, as it can help evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not collect keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents and transmit them through encrypted emails.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that the malware is likely to perform data collection and discovery activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the malware will collect the specified data and transmit it through encrypted emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
