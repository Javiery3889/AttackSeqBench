### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Inception attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Exploiting the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
     - Deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.
     - Establishing persistence by writing the backdoor to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.002-Office Test:**
     - This technique involves using Office templates or add-ins to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves adding a registry run key or startup folder entry to ensure that a program runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access. This aligns with T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
   - **Deployment of POWERSHOWER:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER. This is a logical next step to maintain control and execute further actions.
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The attackers then establish persistence by writing the backdoor to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry. This aligns with T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The attackers would likely deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence to ensure they have a foothold in the system and can maintain control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
