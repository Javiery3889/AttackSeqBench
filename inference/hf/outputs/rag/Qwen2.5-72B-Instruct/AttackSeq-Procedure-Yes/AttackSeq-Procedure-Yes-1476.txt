### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the SLUB backdoor:
     - Achieving persistence by copying itself to `ProgramData\update\` and creating a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName.
     - Potentially retrieving the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics.
     - Proceeding with data exfiltration by uploading files to the file.io website and sharing links via Slack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - These TTPs focus on achieving persistence and privilege escalation by using registry run keys or startup folders. They do not directly address discovery or data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - The backdoor copies itself to `ProgramData\update\` and creates a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName. This aligns with the T1547.001 technique for persistence.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The question asks if the backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics. While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention discovery, it is a common step in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the compromised system.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - The question mentions data exfiltration by uploading files to the file.io website and sharing links via Slack. This is a separate tactic (Exfiltration) and is not covered by the related TTPs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The related TTPs confirm the persistence mechanism but do not provide information about discovery or data exfiltration.
   - However, it is a common practice for malware to perform discovery (e.g., retrieving username and computer name) before exfiltrating data to ensure it has the necessary information to target the exfiltration effectively.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The SLUB backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.
