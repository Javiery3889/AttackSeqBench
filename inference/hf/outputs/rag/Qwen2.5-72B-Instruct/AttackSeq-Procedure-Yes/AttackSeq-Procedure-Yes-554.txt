### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries used ENVYSCOUT to deliver SNOWYAMBER, HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG through various URLs and domains to gain Initial Access after compromising hosting for ENVYSCOUT CobaltStrike redirectors and using actual CobaltStrike C2 domains.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1584.001-Domains (Resource Development):** This technique involves adversaries registering or acquiring domains to use in their operations.
   - **T1608.005-Link Target (Resource Development):** This technique involves adversaries using links to target specific resources or entities.
   - **T1583.001-Domains (Resource Development):** This technique involves adversaries acquiring or registering domains to support their operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1584.001-Domains and T1583.001-Domains:** These techniques are related to the acquisition and registration of domains, which aligns with the question's mention of compromising hosting for ENVYSCOUT CobaltStrike redirectors and using actual CobaltStrike C2 domains.
   - **T1608.005-Link Target:** This technique involves using links to target specific resources, which could be relevant to delivering payloads like SNOWYAMBER, HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG through various URLs and domains.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where adversaries first compromise hosting for ENVYSCOUT CobaltStrike redirectors and use actual CobaltStrike C2 domains. This aligns with the T1584.001 and T1583.001 techniques.
   - After establishing these domains, it is plausible that the adversaries would use these domains to deliver additional payloads (SNOWYAMBER, HALFRIG, and QUARTERRIG) through various URLs and domains to gain Initial Access. This aligns with the T1608.005 technique.
   - The use of ENVYSCOUT to deliver these payloads is consistent with the described attack sequence, as ENVYSCOUT is a known tool used in such operations.
