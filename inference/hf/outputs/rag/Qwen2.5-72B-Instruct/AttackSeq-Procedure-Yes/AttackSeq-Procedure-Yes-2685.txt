### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Elfin would exploit CVE-2018-20250 by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails before deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution.
   - The key points are:
     - Scanning for vulnerable websites.
     - Exploiting CVE-2018-20250.
     - Delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails.
     - Deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client) to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, deliver a payload or exploit a vulnerability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning for Vulnerable Websites:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to identify potential targets.
   - **Exploiting CVE-2018-20250:**
     - CVE-2018-20250 is a specific vulnerability that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system.
   - **Delivering the Exploit via Spear-Phishing Emails:**
     - The related TTP T1566.002-Spearphishing Link suggests that spear-phishing emails with links are a common method for delivering exploits.
   - **Deploying Malware Tools:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill is a logical next step to maintain control and execute further actions.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. Scanning for vulnerable websites, exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) via spear-phishing emails, and then deploying malware tools is a plausible and common attack sequence.
   - The related TTPs support the use of spear-phishing links to deliver the exploit, which is consistent with the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
