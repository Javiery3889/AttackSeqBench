### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a, after evading detection by modifying the firmware update process and preventing event logging, is likely capable of wiping server disks to hide tracks and disrupt operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves actions that prevent or hinder the detection and analysis of malicious activities. Modifying the firmware update process and preventing event logging are examples of impairing defenses.
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This sub-technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and remove evidence of malicious activity. Wiping server disks can be seen as a more extreme form of file deletion, aimed at completely erasing data and logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The malware has already demonstrated the capability to modify firmware and prevent event logging, which are sophisticated techniques for evading detection and impairing defenses.
     - Wiping server disks is a logical next step in the attack sequence to ensure that no traces of the malware or its activities are left behind, further impairing defenses and disrupting operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not capable of wiping server disks. However, given the sophisticated nature of the malware and its existing capabilities, it is highly plausible that it could also perform such an action to cover its tracks and disrupt operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical progression of the attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the malware is capable of wiping server disks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
