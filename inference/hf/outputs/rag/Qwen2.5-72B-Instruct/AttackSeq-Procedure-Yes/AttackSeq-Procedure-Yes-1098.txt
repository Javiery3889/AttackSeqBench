### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus Group, after using malicious macros in job-themed documents to gain initial access, is likely to collect information about network users and settings using tools like `adfind` before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts (which can be domain or local) to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification:** This technique involves modifying Group Policy to escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions using malicious macros in job-themed documents to achieve initial access. This aligns with the techniques T1078 and T1078.002, which involve using valid accounts to gain initial access.
   - **Information Collection:**
     - The question asks if the group is likely to collect information about network users and settings using tools like `adfind`. This is a common step in the reconnaissance phase, where attackers gather information to plan further actions.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question also mentions moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts. This aligns with the use of valid accounts (T1078) and the potential for privilege escalation (T1484.001).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Using malicious macros in job-themed documents to gain initial access.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** Collecting information about network users and settings using tools like `adfind`.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** Moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.
