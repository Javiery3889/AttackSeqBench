### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - It asks whether the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before installing the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Adobe Flash) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then executes the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The spear-phishing attack uses a malicious Flash file (‘show.swf’) to exploit CVE-2015-5119. This aligns with T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
   - **Execution of Shellcode:**
     - Once the exploit is successful, the Flash file will execute shellcode. This is a common step in the exploitation process to gain control over the system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The shellcode is often used for Defense Evasion, which involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This can include techniques like process injection, code obfuscation, and other methods to hide the malicious activity.
   - **Payload Installation:**
     - After the shellcode is executed and the system is compromised, the payload (embedded in the GIF image) is installed. This aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File, where the user is tricked into opening a file that contains the payload.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** The Flash file exploits the vulnerability to gain initial access.
     2. **Execution of Shellcode for Defense Evasion:** The shellcode is executed to evade defenses and gain control over the system.
     3. **Installation of Payload (T1204.002):** The payload embedded in the GIF image is installed after the system is compromised.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
