### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the A41APT campaign will use RDP for lateral movement after conducting discovery activities.
   - The discovery activities mentioned include scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC and deploying tools to uncover domain accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which can include scanning for open ports like RDP (3389) and SMB (445).
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network, often targeting servers and other critical systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The A41APT campaign is conducting discovery activities to identify open RDP and SMB ports. This is a common first step in preparing for lateral movement.
     - Scanning for open RDP ports (T1046) is a direct precursor to using RDP for lateral movement (T1021.001).
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Once the campaign has identified open RDP ports and domain accounts, it is highly likely that they will use RDP to move laterally within the network.
     - RDP is a common and effective method for lateral movement, especially when targeting servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the discovery activities and the common use of RDP for lateral movement, it is highly likely that the A41APT campaign will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
