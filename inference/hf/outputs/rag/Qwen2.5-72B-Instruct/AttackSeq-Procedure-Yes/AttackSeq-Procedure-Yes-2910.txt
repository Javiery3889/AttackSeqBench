### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether threat actors are likely to bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions after using AtomBombing for code injection and execution via legitimate programs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1211 - Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves using vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or network protocols to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **T1055 - Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process to execute arbitrary code while evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **AtomBombing:** This is a specific type of process injection technique that leverages the Windows API to inject code into a process without using common injection methods like `VirtualAllocEx` and `WriteProcessMemory`. It is designed to evade detection by security software.
   - **Exploitation for Defense Evasion (T1211):** This technique can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in security software to bypass defenses.
   - **Process Injection (T1055):** This technique is used to execute code in the context of another process, which can help evade detection by security software.

   Given that AtomBombing is a sophisticated method of process injection designed to evade detection, it is highly likely that threat actors using this technique would also employ other defense evasion strategies to bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that threat actors are likely to bypass these security solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
