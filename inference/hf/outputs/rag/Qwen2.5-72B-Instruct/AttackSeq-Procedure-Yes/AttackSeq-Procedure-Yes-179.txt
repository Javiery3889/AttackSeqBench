### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Infamous Chisel, after performing discovery activities like enumerating data directories and scanning the local network, is likely to leverage its Command and Control (C2) capabilities such as providing SCP functionality, a local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which aligns with the IP scanning mentioned in the question.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active network connections, which is part of the discovery activities.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services, which is also part of the discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The question mentions that Infamous Chisel has performed discovery activities such as enumerating data directories and scanning the local network. These activities are consistent with the related TTPs (T1018, T1049, T1046).
   - **Command and Control (C2) Capabilities:**
     - After performing discovery activities, it is common for malware to leverage its C2 capabilities to exfiltrate data, maintain persistence, and perform further actions. The C2 capabilities mentioned (SCP functionality, local Socks connection, and SSH server/client) are typical for advanced malware to maintain control and exfiltrate data.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The sequence of performing discovery activities followed by leveraging C2 capabilities is a logical and common attack pattern. Discovery activities help the attacker understand the environment, and C2 capabilities are used to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the common behavior of advanced malware, it is likely that Infamous Chisel would leverage its C2 capabilities after performing discovery activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
