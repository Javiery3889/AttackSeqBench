### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 (a known advanced persistent threat group) is likely to perform IP range scanning and vulnerability scanning before using spear phishing emails with crafted documents to achieve initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP ranges to identify potential targets.
   - **T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:** This technique involves scanning identified targets for vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT28 is known for conducting thorough reconnaissance before launching attacks. This includes scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerabilities to better understand the target environment.
     - The related TTPs (T1595.001 and T1595.002) directly support the idea that APT28 would perform these activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 would not perform these reconnaissance activities before spear phishing. However, this is less likely given the group's known tactics and the importance of reconnaissance in targeted attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the known behavior of APT28, it is highly likely that they would perform IP range scanning and vulnerability scanning before using spear phishing emails with crafted documents to achieve initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
