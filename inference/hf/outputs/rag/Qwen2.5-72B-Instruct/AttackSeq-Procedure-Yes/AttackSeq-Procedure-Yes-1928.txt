### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a spyware first extracts Chrome passwords by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the spyware will perform keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**
   - This TTP describes the method of extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the first part of the question where the spyware extracts Chrome passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **First Action (Credential Access):**
     - The spyware uses `libchrome.exe` to extract Chrome passwords by querying the SQLite databases. This is a common method for credential access and is well-documented in the T1555.003 technique.
   - **Second Action (Keylogging for Collection):**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the spyware will then perform keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`.
     - Keylogging is a technique used to capture keystrokes, which can be used to collect additional credentials or sensitive information. This falls under the **Collection** tactic, specifically the **T1056 - Input Capture** technique.
     - However, the use of `libCache32.exe` for keylogging is not a common or well-documented method. Typically, keylogging is performed using dedicated keylogging software or libraries, not `libCache32.exe`.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is possible for a spyware to perform keylogging after extracting credentials, the specific use of `libCache32.exe` for keylogging is not a standard or widely recognized method.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the spyware will use `libCache32.exe` for keylogging.

### Final Answer: B: No
