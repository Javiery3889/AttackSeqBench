### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in a cyber attack:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
     - Stealing stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to evade detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - This technique is used to gain initial access and execute code on the target system. It aligns with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - **File Deletion (T1070.004):**
     - This technique is used to remove traces of the attack, such as log files, temporary files, or other artifacts that could be used to detect or analyze the attack.
   - **Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry:**
     - These techniques are used to steal stored passwords and access tokens, which is a common post-exploitation activity.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After gaining initial access and executing code, an attacker often takes steps to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - Deleting files (T1070.004) is a common defense evasion technique to remove evidence of the attack.
   - Given that the attacker is already engaging in post-exploitation activities like credential dumping, it is highly likely that they would also use file deletion to cover their tracks.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
