### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Ukrainian and Polish state organizations and businesses are likely to be targeted with BlackEnergy spear-phishing emails in the context of the current Ukrainian crisis.
   - It also asks if these emails are likely to be followed by techniques for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) and defeating the signed driver requirement for Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying the code signing policy to allow the execution of unsigned or malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control:**
     - This technique involves bypassing UAC to gain higher privileges without the user's explicit consent.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Emails:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique used by threat actors to gain a foothold in target networks. Given the current Ukrainian crisis, it is highly plausible that Ukrainian and Polish state organizations and businesses would be targeted with such emails.
   - **Bypassing UAC and Defeating Signed Driver Requirement:**
     - Once the initial access is gained through spear-phishing, the next logical steps for an attacker would be to escalate privileges and evade defenses. The related TTPs (T1553.006 and T1548.002) align with these post-compromise activities.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question (spear-phishing followed by UAC bypass and code signing policy modification) is a common attack pattern. It starts with gaining initial access and then moves to privilege escalation and defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the current geopolitical context and the typical attack patterns, it is highly likely that Ukrainian and Polish state organizations and businesses would be targeted with BlackEnergy spear-phishing emails, followed by techniques for bypassing UAC and defeating the signed driver requirement for Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
