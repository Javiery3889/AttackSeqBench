### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15:
     - Used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
     - Stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
     - Deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     - Leveraged RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control:**
     - This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control:**
     - This technique is also about bypassing UAC to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials (T1078.002-Domain Accounts).
     - They also stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely, which is another form of initial access.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**
     - APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. These tools are often used to maintain persistence and gain elevated privileges.
     - RoyalCLI, in particular, is known for its ability to bypass command prompt policy settings (T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control), which aligns with the defense evasion tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that APT15 deployed backdoors and leveraged RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
