### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT42:
     - Conducting internal reconnaissance by accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information.
     - Moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.
     - Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victimâ€™s trusted relationships.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using internal spear-phishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves developing and using email accounts for malicious purposes, such as sending spear-phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT42 will indeed move laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts and then send spear-phishing emails to additional targets.
     - This aligns with the T1534-Internal Spearphishing technique, which involves using internal spear-phishing to move laterally.
     - It also aligns with the T1586.002-Email Accounts technique, which involves using email accounts for malicious purposes.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT42 will not move laterally in the described manner.
     - This does not align with the T1534-Internal Spearphishing technique, which is a common method for lateral movement.
     - It also does not align with the T1586.002-Email Accounts technique, which is relevant to the use of email accounts for spear-phishing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that APT42 will move laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts and then send spear-phishing emails to additional targets.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
