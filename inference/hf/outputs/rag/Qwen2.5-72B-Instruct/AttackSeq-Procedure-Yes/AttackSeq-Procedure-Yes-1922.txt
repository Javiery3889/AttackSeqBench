### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where threat actors use phishing emails to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension for initial access.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the threat actors will use this extension to contact a command and control (C2) server and retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the download of malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments that, when opened, execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - The question mentions the use of phishing emails to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension. This aligns with the T1566.002 and T1566.001 techniques, which are both methods of initial access.
   - **FriarFox Malicious Browser Extension:**
     - Once the FriarFox extension is installed, it can be used to establish a persistent connection to a C2 server. This is a common behavior for malicious browser extensions, as they can communicate with external servers to receive commands or download additional payloads.
   - **Retrieving the Scanbox Payload:**
     - After establishing a connection to the C2 server, it is plausible that the threat actors would use this connection to download and execute additional payloads, such as the Scanbox payload. Scanbox is a toolkit used for reconnaissance and data exfiltration, which fits well into the next stages of an attack after initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that the threat actors will use the FriarFox extension to contact a C2 server and retrieve the Scanbox payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
