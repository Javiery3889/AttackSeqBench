### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Shuckworm, after using HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers, is likely to download additional payloads before using these payloads to maintain control over compromised systems during their cyber espionage activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with C&C servers. It is a common method for maintaining control over compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads after establishing communication with the C&C server.
     - This is a plausible sequence because once a malware establishes a connection with its C&C server, it often downloads additional tools or payloads to enhance its capabilities and maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Shuckworm is not likely to download additional payloads after establishing communication with the C&C server.
     - This is less plausible because it is common for malware to download additional payloads to perform various tasks, such as maintaining control, exfiltrating data, or spreading to other systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common behavior of malware and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Shuckworm would download additional payloads after establishing communication with the C&C server to maintain control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
