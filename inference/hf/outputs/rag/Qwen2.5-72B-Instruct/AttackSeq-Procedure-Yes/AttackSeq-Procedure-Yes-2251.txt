### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy, after maintaining persistence using methods like registry keys and VBScripts for MargulasRAT, is likely to employ tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files, directories, or other artifacts in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1036.004 - Masquerade Task or Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying tasks or services to appear legitimate to users and security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy will likely use tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.
     - The related TTPs (T1036.005 and T1036.004) directly support this choice. Both techniques are part of the Defense Evasion tactic and involve making malicious activities appear legitimate to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy will not use such tactics.
     - This choice is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that mimicking legitimate processes and masquerading tasks or services are common evasion techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SideCopy will indeed employ tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
