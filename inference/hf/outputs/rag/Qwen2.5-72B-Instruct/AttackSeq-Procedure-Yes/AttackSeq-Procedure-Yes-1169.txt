### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Longhorn's malware, after configuring a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol, is likely to communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary scheduling data exfiltration at specific times or intervals to avoid detection.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the adversary exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique aligns with the idea of scheduling data exfiltration to avoid detection. By using scheduled intervals, the malware can reduce the likelihood of being detected by network monitoring tools that look for unusual data transfer patterns.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique aligns with the idea of using the same C2 channel for exfiltration, which is consistent with the malware using a specific domain and IP address for C&C communication over HTTPS.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware is already configured to use a specific domain and IP address for C&C communication over HTTPS, it is plausible that the malware would also use this channel for exfiltration (T1041).
   - Additionally, to avoid detection, the malware is likely to schedule the exfiltration at specific intervals (T1029) to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid triggering alerts based on upload limits.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
