### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aurora malware:
     - Modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
     - Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.
     - Communicating with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):**
     - This technique involves modifying the file-time of a malicious file to match that of a legitimate file to evade detection.
   - **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness (Persistence):**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the services registry to maintain persistence.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port (Command and Control):**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for C&C communication to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:**
     - This aligns with the first part of the question where the file-time of the dropped DLL is modified to match that of an existing system DLL.
   - **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness:**
     - This aligns with the second part of the question where the DLL is loaded into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for C&C communication. However, the question specifically mentions port 443, which is a standard port (HTTPS).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The first two parts of the question (modifying file-time and loading into svchost.exe) align well with the related TTPs.
   - However, the use of port 443 for C&C communication does not align with the T1571-Non-Standard Port technique, as port 443 is a standard port.
   - Additionally, the question mentions a "weak custom encryption scheme," which is not directly addressed by the related TTPs.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question, particularly the use of port 443 and a weak custom encryption scheme, does not align with the provided related TTPs, which suggest the use of non-standard ports for C&C communication.
