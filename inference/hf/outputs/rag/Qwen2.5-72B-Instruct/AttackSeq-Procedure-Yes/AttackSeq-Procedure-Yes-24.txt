### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete, after achieving persistence by creating a task and storing malware, is likely to copy files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Machete is likely to copy files to a special USB device.
     - The related TTP T1025 (Data from Removable Media) directly supports this idea, as it involves collecting data from removable media.
     - Additionally, T1091 (Replication Through Removable Media) suggests that Machete might use USB devices for lateral movement, which could also involve copying files.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Machete is not likely to copy files to a special USB device.
     - However, the related TTPs T1025 and T1091 provide strong evidence that Machete does use removable media for data collection and lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, particularly T1025 and T1091, it is highly likely that Machete would copy files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
