### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Konni APT Group:
     - Scheduling `install.vbs` to run every 33 minutes for persistence using `stopedge.bat`.
     - Using heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, to evade detection.
     - Running `versioninfo.bat` to discover system details such as directory listings and running processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):**
     - The use of `stopedge.bat` to schedule `install.vbs` every 33 minutes aligns with the persistence technique.
   - **Execution (T1053.005-Scheduled Task):**
     - The scheduling of `install.vbs` also aligns with the execution technique, as it ensures the script runs periodically.
   - **Obfuscation and Evasion:**
     - The question asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, to evade detection.
     - APT groups often use obfuscation techniques to avoid detection by security tools and analysts.
     - XOR is a common obfuscation technique used to encode data and scripts.
   - **System Information Gathering:**
     - Running `versioninfo.bat` to discover system details such as directory listings and running processes is a common reconnaissance activity.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the Konni APT Group is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection, it is highly likely that they would use heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR, to avoid detection.
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the behavior of advanced APT groups.
