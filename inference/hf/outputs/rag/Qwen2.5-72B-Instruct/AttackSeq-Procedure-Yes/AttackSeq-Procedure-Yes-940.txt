### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Sednit group using a specific sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails.
   - The sequence in question is:
     1. Distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails.
     2. Use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.
     3. Employ COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
   - These TTPs indicate that the Sednit group uses COM object hijacking for both privilege escalation and persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question states that the initial access is gained through spearphishing emails, which is a common tactic used by the Sednit group to distribute Zebrocy components.
   - **Stage-1 Downloader:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for advanced threat actors to use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute additional malware. This helps in maintaining a low profile and evading detection.
   - **COM Object Hijacking:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that the Sednit group uses COM object hijacking for both privilege escalation and persistence. This technique involves modifying registry keys to ensure that malicious code is executed when certain system components are loaded.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of the Sednit group. They often use spearphishing to gain initial access, employ a Stage-1 downloader to download additional malware, and use COM object hijacking for persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
