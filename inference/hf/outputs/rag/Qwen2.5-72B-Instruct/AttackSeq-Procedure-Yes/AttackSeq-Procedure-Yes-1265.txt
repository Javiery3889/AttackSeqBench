### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group Blind Eagle.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access using a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN.
     - Utilizing PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass.
     - Achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code, which can include loading DLLs and performing other actions.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves placing a script or executable in the Startup folder to ensure it runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions initial access using a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN. This is a plausible method for initial access, as JavaScript can be used to download and execute malicious payloads.
   - **PowerShell for DLL Loading and AMSI Bypass:**
     - The related TTP T1059.001 (PowerShell) supports the use of PowerShell for executing code, which can include loading DLLs and performing AMSI bypass. This is a common technique used by attackers to evade detection and maintain control over the system.
   - **Persistence via Startup Folder:**
     - The related TTP T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) supports the use of the Startup folder to achieve persistence. Placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file is a common method to ensure that the malicious code runs every time the system starts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the plausibility of each step in the sequence, the described sequence of TTPs is likely to be used by the threat group Blind Eagle.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
