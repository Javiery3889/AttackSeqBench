### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in an internet-facing application for Initial Access.
   - The attacker then uses `cmd.exe` to execute SparrowDoor, a malware.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication between the malware and the C&C server.
     - HTTPS is specifically mentioned, which is an encrypted protocol.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique describes the initial access method where the attacker exploits a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain entry into the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.
     - Given the related TTP T1071.001, which specifically mentions the use of HTTPS for Command and Control, this is a plausible and likely scenario.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SparrowDoor will not communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.
     - This is less likely given the related TTP T1071.001, which indicates that HTTPS is a common and secure method for C&C communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP T1071.001, which explicitly mentions the use of HTTPS for Command and Control, the most plausible answer is that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
