### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Hidden Cobra, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence starts with spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a Word document) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document, which aligns with T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment).
     - The use of CVE-2018-4878 to exploit the Word document aligns with T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The question asks if Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give full control and wipe files under the tactic of Resource Development.
     - Resource Development is a tactic that involves gathering information and resources to support future operations, such as developing new tools or capabilities.
     - Developing the Bankshot implants with full control and file wiping capabilities is more aligned with the tactics of **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**, and **Impact** rather than **Resource Development**.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the development of Bankshot implants with full control and file wiping capabilities is more aligned with tactics other than Resource Development, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
