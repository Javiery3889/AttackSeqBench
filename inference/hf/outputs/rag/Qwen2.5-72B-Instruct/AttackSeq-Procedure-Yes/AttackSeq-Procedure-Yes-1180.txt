### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether a backdoor, after collecting machine information and taking screenshots, is likely to communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. It often includes the use of encrypted channels to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots from the victim's system to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given the use of T1104 (Multi-Stage Channels), it is highly likely that the backdoor will use encrypted communication to avoid detection by network security tools. Encrypted channels are a common method to ensure that the communication between the backdoor and the C&C server remains hidden and secure.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor would not use encrypted communication. However, this is less likely given the context of T1104, which emphasizes the use of multiple stages and often includes encryption to maintain stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices in the Command and Control phase, the most plausible sequence is that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
