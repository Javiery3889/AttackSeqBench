### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear phishing campaign targeting officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.
   - The campaign involves a malicious XLS document with a macro code.
   - The macro code is expected to drop a Crimson RAT downloader and then download the fully functional Crimson RAT from a specified IP address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which in this case is the XLS document with a macro.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a template or document to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the macro code within the XLS document will execute to drop a Crimson RAT downloader and then download the fully functional Crimson RAT.
     - This aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique, where the user is tricked into opening the malicious XLS document.
     - The T1221-Template Injection technique supports the idea that the macro code is embedded in the document to evade detection and execute the malicious actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of events is unlikely.
     - However, given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the macro code would execute to drop a downloader and then download the RAT.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the macro code will execute to drop a Crimson RAT downloader and then download the fully functional Crimson RAT.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
