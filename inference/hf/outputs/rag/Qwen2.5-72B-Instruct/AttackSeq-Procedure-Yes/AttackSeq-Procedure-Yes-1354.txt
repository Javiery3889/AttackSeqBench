### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NewsBeef group.
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.
   - It then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download poisoned installers, which will execute PowerSploit scripts, and these scripts will subsequently download and run the Pupy backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking users into opening a malicious file, such as a macro-enabled Office document, which can execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to download and run additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents. This aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique.
   - **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, it is common for adversaries to use PowerShell to execute further commands and scripts. This aligns with the T1059.001-PowerShell technique.
   - **Downloading and Executing Poisons Installers:**
     - PowerShell scripts can be used to download and execute additional payloads, such as poisoned installers. This is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
   - **Executing PowerSploit Scripts:**
     - PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for various post-exploitation activities, including downloading and running additional payloads. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and downloading poisoned installers.
   - **Downloading and Running the Pupy Backdoor:**
     - PowerSploit scripts can be used to download and run the Pupy backdoor, which is a remote access trojan (RAT). This is a common final step in the execution phase to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of steps described in the question, it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download poisoned installers, which will then execute PowerSploit scripts, and these scripts will subsequently download and run the Pupy backdoor.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
