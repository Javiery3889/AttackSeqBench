### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that ProjectM will execute malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy and RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.
   - The question also mentions the use of techniques to evade defense measures such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The related TTPs confirm that ProjectM uses spearphishing with malicious attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access. This aligns with the question's mention of using malicious RTF and Excel files.
   - **Execution:**
     - Once initial access is gained, the next logical step is to execute the malicious code. The related TTP (T1204.002) confirms that ProjectM uses malicious files to execute code.
   - **Use of Trojans and RATs:**
     - After gaining initial access and executing the malicious code, it is common for adversaries to use Trojans and RATs to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system. The question mentions specific Trojans (Crimson, Peppy) and RATs (DarkComet, Bozok), which are known tools used in such scenarios.
   - **Evasion:**
     - The question also mentions the use of techniques to evade defense measures, such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure. This is a common practice in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to avoid detection and attribution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs, it is highly likely that ProjectM will follow this sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
