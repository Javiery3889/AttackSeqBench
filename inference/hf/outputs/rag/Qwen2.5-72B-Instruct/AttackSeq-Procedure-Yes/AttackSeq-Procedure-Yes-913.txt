### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the FAKEM RAT controller, after disguising its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols (Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger), is likely to use encrypted network communication with XOR operations for command and control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1001.003 - Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves disguising network traffic to appear as legitimate protocols to evade detection.
   - **T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or data.
   - **T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric encryption algorithms, which can include XOR operations, to encrypt network communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1001.003 (Protocol or Service Impersonation):** This TTP aligns with the first part of the question, where the FAKEM RAT controller disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols.
   - **T1027.013 (Encrypted/Encoded File):** This TTP suggests that the FAKEM RAT controller might use encryption or encoding to obfuscate data, which is consistent with the idea of using encrypted network communication.
   - **T1573.001 (Symmetric Cryptography):** This TTP specifically mentions the use of symmetric encryption, which can include XOR operations, to encrypt network communications. This aligns with the second part of the question, where the FAKEM RAT controller uses XOR operations for encryption.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the FAKEM RAT controller would use encrypted network communication with XOR operations for command and control activities after disguising its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
