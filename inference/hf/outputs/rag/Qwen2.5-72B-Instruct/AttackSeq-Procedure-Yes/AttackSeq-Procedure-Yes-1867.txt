### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the APT28 threat actor:
     - Initial access via a malicious Word document using the DDE technique.
     - Using Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands.
     - Downloading a file.
     - Creating persistence through a batch file and registry entry.
     - Connecting to a command and control (C2) server.
     - Dropping the first-stage Seduploader malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:**
     - This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via DDE:**
     - The question mentions using a malicious Word document with the DDE technique, which aligns with T1559.002.
   - **Using Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - The question states that PowerShell commands are used, which aligns with T1059.
   - **Downloading a File:**
     - PowerShell can be used to download files, which is a common post-exploitation activity.
   - **Creating Persistence:**
     - Creating persistence through a batch file and registry entry is a common technique used by APT groups to maintain access.
   - **Connecting to a C2 Server:**
     - After gaining persistence, connecting to a C2 server is a typical next step to exfiltrate data or receive further commands.
   - **Dropping Seduploader Malware:**
     - Seduploader is a known first-stage malware used by APT28, which aligns with the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described, the most plausible answer is that APT28 will indeed follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
