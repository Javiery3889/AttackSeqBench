### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that stolen credentials will be sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols before encrypting the data for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated tools to exfiltrate data from a compromised system.
   - **T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not typically used for C2 communication.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a communication channel used to control the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the data is first sent using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) and then encrypted for exfiltration.
     - However, the related TTPs suggest that exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041) or over a symmetrically encrypted non-C2 protocol (T1048.001) are more common and direct methods.
     - Standard application layer protocols are often used for initial data transfer, but they are not typically used for exfiltration without encryption, especially in a scenario where the data is sensitive (like stolen credentials).

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the data is not sent using standard application layer protocols before encryption.
     - This aligns better with the related TTPs, which suggest that exfiltration is typically done over a C2 channel (T1041) or over a symmetrically encrypted non-C2 protocol (T1048.001).
     - These methods ensure that the data is encrypted and secure during exfiltration, which is a more plausible and secure approach for exfiltrating sensitive data like stolen credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the typical methods used for exfiltration, the most plausible sequence is that the stolen credentials are not sent using standard application layer protocols before encryption.

**Final Answer: B: No**
