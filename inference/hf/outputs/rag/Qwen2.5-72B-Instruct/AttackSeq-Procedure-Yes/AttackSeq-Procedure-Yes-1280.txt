### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Tropic Trooper.
   - The sequence involves gaining initial access through a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor, downloading and installing an MSI package, and then establishing persistence and connecting to a command-and-control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Microsoft Office) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.006-Add-ins:**
     - This technique involves using Office add-ins to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (T1203).
     - This leads to the execution of a malicious document that downloads and installs an MSI package.
   - **Execution of Malicious Documents:**
     - The malicious document hosting the backdoor's dropper is executed as part of the initial exploitation (T1203).
   - **Persistence:**
     - After the initial execution, the backdoor establishes persistence. This can be done through various methods, such as DLL side-loading (T1574.002) or Office add-ins (T1137.006).
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once persistence is established, the backdoor decrypts its configuration file and connects to the C2 server via SSL.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Exploit Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to execute a malicious document.
     2. Download and install an MSI package.
     3. Execute the backdoor's dropper.
     4. Establish persistence.
     5. Decrypt the configuration file and connect to the C2 server.
   - The question specifically asks if the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence and connects to the C2 server.
   - Based on the sequence, the malicious documents are executed as part of the initial exploitation, which happens before the backdoor establishes persistence and connects to the C2 server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
