### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Babar's dropper ensures persistence by creating a registry key to execute a DLL using regsvr32.exe at system boot time.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the dropper will reduce forensic artifacts by using cmd.exe to delete the dropper binary on disk for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1218.010-Regsvr32:** This technique involves using regsvr32.exe to execute arbitrary code, which is consistent with the described persistence mechanism.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This tactic involves techniques to remove or alter forensic artifacts to evade detection.
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This specific technique involves deleting files to remove forensic evidence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism (T1218.010-Regsvr32):** The dropper creates a registry key to ensure that the DLL is executed at system boot time using regsvr32.exe. This is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal):** The dropper is likely to take additional steps to reduce forensic artifacts to avoid detection.
   - **File Deletion (T1070.004-File Deletion):** Deleting the dropper binary on disk is a specific technique under indicator removal that aligns with the goal of reducing forensic artifacts.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the dropper has already taken steps to ensure persistence, it is logical that it would also take steps to reduce forensic artifacts to avoid detection.
   - The use of cmd.exe to delete the dropper binary is a common and effective method for achieving this goal.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
