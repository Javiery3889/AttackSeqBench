### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Bisonal dropper:
     - It sets up persistence by creating a registry entry to execute a decrypted DLL payload upon system reboot.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the Bisonal variant will communicate with its C2 addresses by sending an HTTP POST request for command and control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Bisonal variant will indeed communicate with its C2 addresses using HTTP POST requests.
     - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols supports this choice, as it indicates that web protocols (like HTTP) are commonly used for C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Bisonal variant will not communicate with its C2 addresses using HTTP POST requests.
     - This choice is less supported by the related TTPs, as T1071.001-Web Protocols specifically mentions the use of web protocols for C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of HTTP for C2 communications, the most plausible answer is that the Bisonal variant will communicate with its C2 addresses using HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
