### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BlackEnergy 3 malware, after using HTTP to communicate with its C2 server and sending localization data and keyboard layout information, is likely to function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves adversaries exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. This is a common method to avoid detection by using established and trusted communication channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server.
     - Given that the malware has already established communication with the C2 server and has sent localization data and keyboard layout information, it is plausible that it could continue to gather and exfiltrate additional data, such as network traffic, using the same C2 channel.
     - The related TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel supports this scenario, as it describes the use of the same channel for both C2 and exfiltration purposes.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server.
     - While it is possible that the malware might not have this capability, the related TTP and the context of the question suggest that it is more likely to continue exfiltrating data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
