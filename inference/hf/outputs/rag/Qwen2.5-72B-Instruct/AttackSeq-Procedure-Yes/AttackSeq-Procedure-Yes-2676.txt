### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ZoxPNG, after exploiting proxy settings for defense evasion using the WinInet API, is likely to establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route C2 traffic through an intermediary server to mask the true destination or to bypass network defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ZoxPNG will use an HTTP GET request to establish contact with the C2 server.
     - Given the related TTPs:
       - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** indicates that HTTP/HTTPS is a common method for C2 communication.
       - **T1090-Proxy** suggests that the malware might use a proxy to route this traffic, which aligns with the use of the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings.
     - Therefore, it is plausible that after exploiting proxy settings, ZoxPNG would use an HTTP GET request to establish C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ZoxPNG will not use an HTTP GET request to establish contact with the C2 server.
     - This choice does not align well with the related TTPs, as both T1071.001 and T1090 indicate that HTTP/HTTPS and proxy usage are common in C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the most likely answer is that ZoxPNG will use an HTTP GET request to establish contact with the C2 server after exploiting proxy settings.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
