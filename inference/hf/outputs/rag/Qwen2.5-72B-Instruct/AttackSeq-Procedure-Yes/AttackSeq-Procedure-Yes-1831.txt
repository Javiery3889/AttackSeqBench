### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideWinder malware:
     - Evasion techniques: obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation.
     - Collection of device information by the callCam app.
     - Encryption of the collected data.
     - Sending the encrypted data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving data using custom methods, which can be a form of data encryption or obfuscation to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves altering the appearance of files or information to make them harder to detect or analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - The question mentions obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation, which align with the T1027 technique (Obfuscated Files or Information).
   - **Collection of Device Information:**
     - The question asks if the callCam app is likely to collect device information by executing in the background. This aligns with the Collection tactic, which involves gathering data from the victim's system.
   - **Encryption and Sending Data:**
     - The question mentions encrypting the data and sending it to the C&C server. This aligns with the T1560.003 technique (Archive via Custom Method), which can involve encrypting data before exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (evasion, collection, encryption, and exfiltration) is consistent with the related TTPs.
   - The callCam app is likely to collect device information by executing in the background, as this is a common step in the collection phase of an attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
