### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether GOLDBACKDOOR, after evading detection through a multi-stage deployment using obfuscated PowerShell scripts, is likely to use Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs for receiving commands and exfiltrating data during its Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which is consistent with the initial stage of the attack where obfuscated PowerShell scripts are used to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves the use of bidirectional communication channels, which are essential for receiving commands and exfiltrating data. This is relevant to the Command and Control phase of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that GOLDBACKDOOR is likely to use Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs for Command and Control.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs are known to be used by various malware and backdoors for Command and Control (C2) operations. They provide a legitimate and often unblocked communication channel that can be used to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
       - The use of bidirectional communication (T1102.002) aligns with the need for both receiving commands and exfiltrating data.
       - Given the sophisticated nature of GOLDBACKDOOR and its use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, it is plausible that it would leverage legitimate services like OneDrive and Graph APIs to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GOLDBACKDOOR is not likely to use Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs for Command and Control.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - While this is a possible scenario, it is less likely given the context of the related TTPs and the sophisticated nature of GOLDBACKDOOR.
       - The use of bidirectional communication (T1102.002) strongly suggests the need for a reliable and stealthy C2 channel, which OneDrive and Graph APIs can provide.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is that GOLDBACKDOOR is likely to use Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs for receiving commands and exfiltrating data during its Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
