### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Rocra attackers will use a multi-functional framework for defense evasion, scan the local network, use admin credentials for lateral movement, and then leverage a complex C&C infrastructure with over 60 domain names to control infected machines.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of valid domain accounts (T1078.002) is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the question's mention of using admin credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of a multi-functional framework resistant to C&C server takeover is a sophisticated defense evasion technique. This aligns with the question's mention of using a multi-functional framework for defense evasion.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Scanning the local network and using admin credentials for lateral movement (T1021.002) is a common tactic in advanced attacks. This aligns with the question's mention of scanning the local network and using admin credentials for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):**
     - Leveraging a complex C&C infrastructure with over 60 domain names is a sophisticated method to control infected machines. This aligns with the question's mention of using a complex C&C infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the related TTPs with the sequence of actions described in the question, it is likely that Rocra attackers will follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
