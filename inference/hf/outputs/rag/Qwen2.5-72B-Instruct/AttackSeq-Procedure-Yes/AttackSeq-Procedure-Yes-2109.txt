### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors will access the server via panel login, SSH, or RDP before exposing the malware controller on a port to administer commands to infections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to tunnel command and control (C2) traffic.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.004-Server:** This technique involves acquiring and setting up a server to support operations.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1584.004-Server:** This technique indicates that threat actors acquire and set up a server, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the server is acquired and configured.
   - **T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique suggests that threat actors use RDP to access the server, which is one of the methods mentioned in the question (panel login, SSH, or RDP).
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique is related to command and control, which involves exposing the malware controller on a port to administer commands to infections.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves acquiring and configuring a server, followed by accessing the server via RDP (or similar methods), and then exposing the malware controller.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence:
     - **T1584.004-Server** confirms the server acquisition and setup.
     - **T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol** confirms the use of RDP to access the server.
     - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling** confirms the exposure of the malware controller for command and control.
