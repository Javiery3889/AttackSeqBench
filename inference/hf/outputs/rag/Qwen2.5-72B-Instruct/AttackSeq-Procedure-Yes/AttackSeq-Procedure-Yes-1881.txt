### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use specific tools (Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE) for lateral movement after performing internal reconnaissance and before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion of data to disrupt availability.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI for execution of commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - FIN13 is known to use native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance and discovery. This aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The question mentions the use of Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. Invoke-WMIExec is a tool that leverages WMI for remote command execution, which aligns with the T1047 technique.
   - **Data Collection and Exfiltration:**
     - The question states that FIN13 will collect data from network shared drives and target specific information for fraudulent transactions. This is a common next step after lateral movement.
   - **Impact:**
     - The related TTP T1485 (Data Destruction) is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question, which focuses on lateral movement and data collection rather than data destruction.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance, lateral movement using WMI and web shells, and data collection) is consistent with the known TTPs of FIN13 and the related TTP T1047 (WMI).

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
