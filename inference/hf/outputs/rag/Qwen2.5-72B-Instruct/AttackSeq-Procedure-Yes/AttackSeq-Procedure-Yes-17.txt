### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the "Machete" malware:
     - Establishing persistence by creating a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe'.
     - Installing itself in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will subsequently log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard to collect information from the target machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves logging keystrokes to capture sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1123-Audio Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing audio from the computer's microphone.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique is listed again, emphasizing the importance of keylogging in the context of credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (T1056.001):**
     - Keylogging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information such as passwords and other credentials. Given that the malware has established persistence and is likely to be designed to collect information, keylogging is a plausible next step.
   - **Audio Capture (T1123):**
     - Capturing audio from the microphone is another method of collecting information, which can be used to gather sensitive conversations or background noise that might provide additional context. This is also a plausible action for a sophisticated malware like "Machete."
   - **Clipboard Hijacking:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, clipboard hijacking is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information that users copy and paste. Given the context of the other collection techniques, it is reasonable to assume that clipboard hijacking could also be part of the malware's capabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practices of sophisticated malware, it is likely that "Machete" malware will log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard to collect information from the target machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
