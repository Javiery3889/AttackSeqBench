### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will use Empire stagers to create multiple stages for obfuscating the command-and-control (C2) channel after employing reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:**
     - Reflective code loading is a technique where adversaries load a DLL into memory without using the Windows loader, which can help evade detection by security software.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - Multi-stage channels involve using multiple stages of communication to obfuscate the C2 channel, making it harder for defenders to detect and disrupt the communication.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to execute commands and scripts, often used by adversaries for various stages of an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reflective Code Loading (T1620):**
     - This technique is used to evade defenses by loading a DLL directly into memory, which is a common initial step in many sophisticated attacks.
   - **Multi-Stage Channels (T1104):**
     - After evading defenses, adversaries often use multi-stage channels to further obfuscate their C2 communications. This is a logical next step to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **PowerShell (T1059.001):**
     - PowerShell can be used to execute the reflective code loading and to manage the multi-stage C2 channels, making it a versatile tool in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the adversaries have already used reflective code loading to evade defenses, it is highly likely that they will continue to use sophisticated techniques to maintain their foothold and avoid detection. Multi-stage channels are a common and effective method for obfuscating C2 communications, which aligns well with the use of reflective code loading.
   - The use of Empire stagers, which are known for their ability to create multi-stage channels, fits perfectly into this sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
