### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug, after decrypting its configuration data and performing system discovery, is likely to collect data from removable media during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system's network configuration, such as IP addresses, hostnames, and system locale. This aligns with the initial phase described in the question where Korplug retrieves system details.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves the adversary collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices. This is relevant to the Collection phase mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that Korplug has already performed system discovery and retrieved system details, it is plausible that it would proceed to collect data from removable media. The technique T1025 (Data from Removable Media) is a common method for adversaries to gather additional data that might be useful for their objectives.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Korplug would not collect data from removable media. However, given the context of the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, it is less likely that Korplug would skip this step, especially if it has already performed detailed discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, it is more plausible that Korplug would collect data from removable media during the Collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
