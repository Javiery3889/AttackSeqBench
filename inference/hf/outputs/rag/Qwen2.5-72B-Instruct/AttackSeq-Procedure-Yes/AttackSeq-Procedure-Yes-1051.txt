### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Darkhotel APT group will use small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code before employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.
   - The key elements to consider are:
     - Compromising trusted commercial network resources.
     - Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits.
     - Signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
     - This technique involves signing malicious code with a valid digital certificate to make it appear legitimate and evade detection by security systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources:**
     - This is a common initial step in many APT campaigns to establish a foothold and leverage trusted infrastructure.
   - **Using Small Downloaders and Zero-Day Exploits:**
     - Small downloaders are often used to download and execute additional payloads, and zero-day exploits are highly valuable for gaining initial access or escalating privileges.
   - **Signing Backdoors with Digital Certificates:**
     - This is a sophisticated technique used for defense evasion, making it more likely that the malware will bypass security measures.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is likely.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is unlikely.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT group is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the known tactics of APT groups, including the use of small downloaders, zero-day exploits, and code signing for defense evasion.
   - The related TTP (T1553.002-Code Signing) further supports the likelihood of this sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
