### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Konni APT Group.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether the group is likely to use the 'versioninfo.bat' script to discover information about the user's computer after executing obfuscated scripts like 'update.vbs' and 'activate.vbs', and before exfiltrating the collected data using 'unactivate.vbs'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute code on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution of Obfuscated Scripts:**
     - The question mentions the execution of 'update.vbs' and 'activate.vbs'. These are likely Visual Basic scripts, which align with the T1059.005 technique.
   - **Discovery of System Information:**
     - The 'versioninfo.bat' script is mentioned as a potential step to discover information about the user's computer. This aligns with the T1082 technique.
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - The 'unactivate.vbs' script is mentioned as the final step to exfiltrate the collected data. This is a logical step after gathering information.

4. **Plausibility of the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question (execution of obfuscated scripts, discovery of system information, and exfiltration of data) is a common and logical sequence in cyber attacks.
   - The use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system information fits well into the discovery phase, which is often a necessary step before exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
