### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the QuasarRAT backdoor, after achieving persistence by installing itself as a service named DILLJUICE, is likely to use the CppHostCLR technique to decrypt, load, and invoke an embedded .NET assembly in-memory for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence. The service can be configured to start automatically when the system boots, ensuring that the malware is always running.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:**
     - Reflective code loading is a technique where malware loads a DLL or other code into memory without using the standard Windows loading mechanisms. This can help evade detection by security software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service):**
     - The question states that QuasarRAT achieves persistence by installing itself as a service named DILLJUICE. This aligns with the T1543.003 technique.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1620-Reflective Code Loading):**
     - The question also mentions the CppHostCLR technique, which is a specific method for loading and executing .NET assemblies in memory. Reflective code loading is a broader category that includes techniques like CppHostCLR.
     - CppHostCLR is a known method for loading .NET assemblies in memory without touching the disk, which is a common technique for evading detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that QuasarRAT is known to use advanced techniques for persistence and defense evasion, it is plausible that it would use CppHostCLR to load and execute an embedded .NET assembly in memory. This aligns with the broader technique of reflective code loading (T1620).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
