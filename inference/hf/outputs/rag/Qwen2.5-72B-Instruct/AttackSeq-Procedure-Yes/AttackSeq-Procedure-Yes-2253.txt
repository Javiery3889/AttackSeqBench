### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT during Credential Access, and then use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from various sources and staging it locally before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001 - Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001 - Credentials In Files:** This technique involves accessing credentials stored in files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access using njRAT:**
     - njRAT is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that can be used to steal credentials and other sensitive information. It aligns with the technique T1552.001 - Credentials In Files, as it can access and steal credentials stored in files.
   - **Targeting Indian Government Employees:**
     - SideCopy is known to target Indian government employees, which makes this part of the sequence plausible.
   - **Using GoLang-based File Recon Plugins:**
     - GoLang is a programming language that can be used to develop file reconnaissance tools. The use of GoLang-based plugins for file reconnaissance aligns with the technique T1074.001 - Local Data Staging, as it involves collecting and staging data before exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration of Kavach Authentication Databases:**
     - Kavach is an authentication system used by the Indian government. Exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases would be a significant target for an attacker like SideCopy, especially after gaining access to credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the TTPs with the described sequence and the known targeting behavior of SideCopy, it is likely that SideCopy would follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
