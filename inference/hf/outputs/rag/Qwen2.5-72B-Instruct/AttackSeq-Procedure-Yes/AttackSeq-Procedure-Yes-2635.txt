### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Machete malware:
     - **Discovery**: Detecting newly inserted devices, producing file listings, and gathering browser data.
     - **Data Collection**: Potentially using screen capture.
     - **Communication**: Leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is consistent with the malware using FTP and HTTP ports for communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols, which could also be relevant to the use of FTP and HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery**: The related TTPs do not directly address the discovery phase, but it is a common initial step for malware to gather information about the environment.
   - **Data Collection**: The question specifically asks about the use of screen capture. Screen capture (T1113) is a technique used to capture the contents of the screen, which can be valuable for data collection. However, the related TTPs do not mention screen capture.
   - **Communication**: The related TTPs (T1041 and T1048.003) are directly relevant to the communication phase, indicating that the malware uses FTP and HTTP for exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention screen capture, it is a common technique used in data collection. However, the question is asking if it is **likely** to use screen capture before leveraging FTP and HTTP for communication.
   - Given the context and the commonality of screen capture in data collection, it is plausible that Machete malware might use screen capture as part of its data collection process.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
