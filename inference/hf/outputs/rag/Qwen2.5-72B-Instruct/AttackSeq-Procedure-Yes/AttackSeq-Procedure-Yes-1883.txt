### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether FIN13 is likely to transfer tools into the environment for Command and Control (C2) after using Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - FIN13 has already used Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
     - The question is about the likelihood of transferring tools for C2.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves using tools to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools into the environment to establish or maintain C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE:**
     - These tools are used for lateral movement, which aligns with the T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer technique.
   - **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105):**
     - This technique is used to transfer tools into the environment for C2 purposes.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - After successfully moving laterally within the network using Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE, it is logical for an attacker to then transfer additional tools to maintain and establish C2.
     - This aligns with the T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer technique, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of events and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is highly likely that FIN13 would transfer tools into the environment for C2 after lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
