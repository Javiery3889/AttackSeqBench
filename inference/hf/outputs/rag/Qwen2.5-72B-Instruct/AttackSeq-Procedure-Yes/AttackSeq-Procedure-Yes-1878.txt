### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - **Technique: T1003.001 - LSASS Memory**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1003.001 - LSASS Memory** is a technique under the **Credential Access** tactic. This technique involves dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to extract credentials.
   - The question also mentions gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance. This is typically part of the **Reconnaissance** or **Discovery** tactics.
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. **Reconnaissance/Discovery**: Gathering information on network and host configurations.
     2. **Credential Access**: Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - It is common for advanced threat actors like FIN13 to perform reconnaissance and discovery activities before moving to credential access. This helps them understand the environment and identify potential targets for credential theft.
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common attack pattern. Attackers often gather information about the network and host configurations to identify the best targets for credential theft.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
