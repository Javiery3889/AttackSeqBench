### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the PowerLess Backdoor, after capturing user credentials using a keylogger and performing OS credential dumping with known LOLBIN techniques, is likely to communicate with a C2 server using encrypted channels and proxy techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel with a C2 server, which can include encrypted and proxied communication.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging and Credential Dumping:**
     - The PowerLess Backdoor has already captured user credentials using a keylogger and performed OS credential dumping. This aligns with the T1056.001 technique.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - After capturing credentials, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the data. T1041 indicates that this exfiltration can occur over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Bidirectional Communication:**
     - T1102.002 suggests that the communication with the C2 server can be bidirectional, which often includes encrypted and proxied communication to avoid detection and ensure secure data transfer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is highly likely that the PowerLess Backdoor will communicate with a C2 server using encrypted channels and proxy techniques to exfiltrate the captured credentials and maintain secure communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
