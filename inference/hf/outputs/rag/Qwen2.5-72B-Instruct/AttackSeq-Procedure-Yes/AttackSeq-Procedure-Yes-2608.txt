### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
     - Exploiting the victim's browser using CVE-2015-5119 to deliver a first-stage backdoor malware.
     - Leveraging a Windows privilege escalation exploit within the malware to gain higher privileges.
     - Using a scheduled task to establish persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:**
     - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence by ensuring that the malware is executed at regular intervals or at specific times.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - The question mentions the use of CVE-2015-5119 to exploit the victim's browser, which aligns with T1203.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The question asks if the Sednit group is likely to leverage a Windows privilege escalation exploit to gain higher privileges. This is a common step in many attack sequences to ensure that the attacker has the necessary permissions to perform further actions.
   - **Scheduled Task (T1053.005):**
     - The question mentions using a scheduled task to establish persistence, which aligns with T1053.005.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common attack pattern:
     - **Initial Exploitation:** The attacker uses a known vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access to the victim's system.
     - **Privilege Escalation:** Once the initial access is gained, the attacker often attempts to escalate privileges to gain higher-level access, which is necessary for many follow-up actions.
     - **Persistence:** After gaining higher privileges, the attacker sets up a scheduled task to ensure that the malware remains active and can be re-executed even if the system is restarted.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
