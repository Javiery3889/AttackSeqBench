### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FamousSparrow:
     - They exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access.
     - They dropped and executed SparrowDoor through cmd.exe.
     - The question asks if it is likely that they achieved Persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - These TTPs indicate that creating a registry Run key entry is a common method for achieving both Privilege Escalation and Persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that FamousSparrow achieved Persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex.
     - The related TTPs support this by indicating that creating a registry Run key entry is a common method for achieving Persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that FamousSparrow achieved Persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that creating a registry Run key entry is a common method for achieving Persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common use of registry Run key entries for Persistence, the most plausible answer is that FamousSparrow likely achieved Persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
