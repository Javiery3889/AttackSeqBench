### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms for defense evasion before using PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation.
   - The key elements are:
     - Web shells and custom in-memory malware for persistence.
     - Interference with logging mechanisms for defense evasion.
     - Use of PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one, which can be used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Interference with Logging Mechanisms:**
     - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention logging mechanisms, T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) is a form of defense evasion that can be used to interfere with logging mechanisms. For example, hijacking a logging DLL to prevent logs from being written or to write false logs.
   - **Use of PotatoEx.dll for Privilege Escalation:**
     - T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) is directly related to using techniques like PotatoEx.dll to gain higher privileges.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is common for attackers to first ensure that their actions are not logged (defense evasion) before attempting privilege escalation. This helps to avoid detection and maintain a low profile.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that TG1021 would interfere with logging mechanisms for defense evasion before using PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation. This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where attackers first try to avoid detection and then escalate privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
