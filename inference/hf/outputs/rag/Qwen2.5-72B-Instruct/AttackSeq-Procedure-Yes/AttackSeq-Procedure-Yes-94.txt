### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Checking for antivirus software using WMI.
     - Communicating with the C2 server.
     - Using DLL sideloading to execute Srvstr.exe for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, an RTF document) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):**
     - The initial step of exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file aligns with this technique.
   - **Checking for Antivirus Software using WMI:**
     - This is a common step in post-exploitation to ensure the environment is safe for further actions. However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Communicating with the C2 Server:**
     - This is a typical next step after gaining initial access to establish a command and control (C2) channel. However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002):**
     - This technique is mentioned in the related TTPs and is used for defense evasion by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question includes steps that are logical and common in post-exploitation activities, such as checking for antivirus software and communicating with a C2 server.
   - However, the related TTPs only explicitly mention the initial exploitation and the use of DLL side-loading for defense evasion.
   - Given the context and the logical flow of the attack, it is plausible that Sidewinder would employ the HTA file to check for antivirus software and communicate with the C2 server before using DLL sideloading to execute Srvstr.exe.
