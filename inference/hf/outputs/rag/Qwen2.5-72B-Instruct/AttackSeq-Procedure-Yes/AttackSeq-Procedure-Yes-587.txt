### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities starting with reconnaissance using the DOCKERGEDDON function to scan netblocks, detect misconfigured Docker APIs, and deploy malicious containers.
   - It then asks if it is likely that attackers will leverage compromised websites to host malicious files to develop their attacker infrastructure, followed by exploiting vulnerabilities using open-source and offensive security tools during resource development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying a container, which aligns with the use of DOCKERGEDDON to deploy malicious containers.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target:** This technique involves using compromised websites to host malicious files, which is a common method for developing attacker infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance activities using DOCKERGEDDON.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (T1595-Active Scanning):** The use of DOCKERGEDDON to scan netblocks and detect misconfigured Docker APIs is a clear example of active scanning.
   - **Execution (T1610-Deploy Container):** Deploying malicious containers using DOCKERGEDDON fits this technique.
   - **Resource Development (T1608.004-Drive-by Target):** Leveraging compromised websites to host malicious files is a common method for resource development, which aligns with the question's description of developing attacker infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The reconnaissance activities using DOCKERGEDDON, followed by deploying malicious containers, and then leveraging compromised websites to host malicious files for resource development, is a logical and common attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
