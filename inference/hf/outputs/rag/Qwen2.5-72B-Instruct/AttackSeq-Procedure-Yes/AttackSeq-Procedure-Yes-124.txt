### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers and perform actions like updating relays or downloading files, Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', which later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data to disrupt or destroy the target's operations.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication and file operations suggests a sophisticated and multi-stage attack.
     - The deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' aligns with the T1485-Data Destruction technique, which is part of the Impact tactic. This indicates a final stage of the attack where the goal is to cause significant damage.
     - The transition of 'Apostle' into functioning ransomware further suggests a strategic evolution in the attack, possibly to maximize the impact and financial gain.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that despite the sophisticated initial stages of the attack, the attackers did not proceed to the final destructive phase.
     - Given the context of the related TTPs and the nature of advanced persistent threats (APTs), it is less likely that the attackers would stop short of causing significant damage.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical progression of the attack, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Agrius did deploy wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data on targeted systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
