### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the BlueDelta campaign is likely to have exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information before using web protocols for Command and Control activities.
   - The key elements to consider are:
     - Collection of emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter.
     - Exfiltration of session cookies, address book, and database information.
     - Use of web protocols for Command and Control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie:**
     - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to maintain access to a web application.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for Command and Control (C2) activities.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting emails from a local email client or webmail application.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection of Emails:**
     - The question mentions the collection of emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter, which aligns with the T1114.001-Local Email Collection technique.
   - **Exfiltration of Session Cookies, Address Book, and Database Information:**
     - The T1550.004-Web Session Cookie technique suggests that the attackers might steal session cookies to maintain access to the Roundcube webmail application.
     - The question also mentions exfiltration of the address book and database information, which is a common step in data exfiltration to gather more information about the victim.
   - **Command and Control Activities:**
     - The T1071.003-Mail Protocols technique indicates that the attackers might use mail protocols for C2 activities, which is consistent with the question's mention of using web protocols for C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the related TTPs with the steps described in the question, it is plausible that the BlueDelta campaign exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information before utilizing web protocols for Command and Control activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
