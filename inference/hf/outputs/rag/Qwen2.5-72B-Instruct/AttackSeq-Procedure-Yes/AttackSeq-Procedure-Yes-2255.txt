### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SideCopy APT will target government personnel in India to gather victim identity information before mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT to develop their own malware for espionage.
   - The key elements are:
     - Targeting military personnel through decoys and honeytraps.
     - Targeting government personnel in India.
     - Gathering victim identity information.
     - Mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT.
     - Developing their own malware for espionage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion):**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying files, directories, or registry keys to match the names or locations of legitimate system or application components.
   - **T1656-Impersonation (Defense Evasion):**
     - This technique involves an adversary assuming the identity of a legitimate user or system to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Targeting Military Personnel:**
     - The question mentions that SideCopy APT has already deployed themes targeting military personnel through decoys and honeytraps. This suggests that they have a history of using sophisticated social engineering techniques to gather information.
   - **Targeting Government Personnel:**
     - Given that SideCopy APT has targeted military personnel, it is plausible that they would also target government personnel, especially in a country like India, where military and government personnel often have overlapping roles and access to sensitive information.
   - **Gathering Victim Identity Information:**
     - The T1656-Impersonation technique aligns with the idea of gathering victim identity information. Impersonation is a common tactic used to gain trust and access to sensitive systems.
   - **Mimicking Legitimate Infection Chains:**
     - The T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location technique suggests that SideCopy APT might use this method to make their malware appear legitimate, which is a common step in mimicking infection chains.
   - **Developing Malware for Espionage:**
     - The combination of gathering identity information and mimicking legitimate infection chains strongly suggests that SideCopy APT is preparing to develop malware for espionage purposes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described in the question, it is likely that SideCopy APT will target government personnel in India to gather victim identity information before mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT to develop their own malware for espionage.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
