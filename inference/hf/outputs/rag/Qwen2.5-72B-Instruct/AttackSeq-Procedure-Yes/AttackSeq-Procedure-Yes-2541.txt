### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Deep Panda after gaining initial access through the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability.
     - Spawning PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts.
     - Executing PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files.
     - Ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which is a common method for downloading and running additional files and maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Log4Shell vulnerability is a known initial access vector, and it is plausible that Deep Panda would use this to gain entry into the system.
   - **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
     - The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts is a common technique (T1059.001) and aligns with the described actions.
   - **Execution of Batch Files:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is common for threat actors to use batch files in conjunction with PowerShell scripts to perform additional tasks.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2` is a method of ensuring persistence, which is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described and the alignment with the related TTPs, it is likely that Deep Panda would follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
