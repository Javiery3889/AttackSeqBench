### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring and maintaining domain names for use in future operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party software update mechanism to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique also involves acquiring and maintaining domain names for use in future operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did park domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts.
     - The related TTPs T1584.001-Domains and T1583.001-Domains both support the idea that attackers often acquire and maintain domain names as part of their Resource Development efforts.
     - It is common for attackers to secure infrastructure, including domain names, before launching a supply chain compromise to ensure they have the necessary resources for the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not park domains for future use.
     - This is less likely given the related TTPs, which indicate that domain acquisition is a common part of Resource Development.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the common practice in cyber operations, it is more plausible that the attackers did park domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
