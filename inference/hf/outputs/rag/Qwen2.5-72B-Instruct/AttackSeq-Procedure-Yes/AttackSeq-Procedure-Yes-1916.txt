### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
     - Utilizing tools like mimikatz or PwDump for credential theft.
     - Identifying systems of interest.
     - Staging data in multi-part archives.
     - Placing the data in the Recycle Bin.
     - Exfiltrating the data to other MSP or victim networks and then to their C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging**
     - This technique involves adversaries collecting data from a local system and placing it in a central location or directory for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - APT10 is known to conduct internal reconnaissance to understand the network topology and identify valuable targets.
   - **Credential Theft:**
     - Tools like mimikatz and PwDump are commonly used by APT10 to steal credentials, which are then used to gain further access and move laterally within the network.
   - **Identifying Systems of Interest:**
     - After gaining access and stealing credentials, APT10 would identify systems that contain valuable data.
   - **Staging Data:**
     - The related TTP T1074.001 (Local Data Staging) aligns with the described action of staging data in multi-part archives.
   - **Placing Data in the Recycle Bin:**
     - Placing data in the Recycle Bin is a common technique to hide data and avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - APT10 is known to exfiltrate data to other MSP or victim networks and then to their C2 servers to avoid direct detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the alignment with the related TTP, the most plausible answer is that APT10 is likely to follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
