### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CozyDuke, after being executed by its dropper using `rundll32.exe` and performing tasks like establishing persistence, is likely to use COM-object hijacking to ensure continued execution before communicating with its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32 (Execution)**: This technique involves using `rundll32.exe` to execute code, which is consistent with the initial execution of CozyDuke.
   - **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking (Persistence)**: This technique involves hijacking COM objects to maintain persistence, which is relevant to the question of whether CozyDuke will use COM-object hijacking.
   - **T1559.001-Component Object Model (Execution)**: This technique involves using COM to execute code, which is related to the execution phase but not directly to persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Execution**: The use of `rundll32.exe` (T1218.011) is consistent with the initial execution of CozyDuke.
   - **Establishing Persistence**: The question mentions that CozyDuke performs tasks such as establishing persistence. One of the related TTPs (T1546.015) specifically mentions COM-object hijacking as a method of persistence.
   - **Communication with C&C Server**: The question also mentions that CozyDuke communicates with its C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter. This is a common behavior for malware after establishing persistence and ensuring continued execution.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that COM-object hijacking (T1546.015) is a method of persistence and is listed as a related TTP, it is plausible that CozyDuke would use this technique to ensure continued execution before communicating with its C&C server.
