### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.
   - The context involves the use of mobile applications loaded with spyware to collect sensitive information (contact lists and geo-location) during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the victim's network to the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication (e.g., ICMP, DNS) to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the stolen data will be sent over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.
     - **Supporting Evidence:**
       - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a relevant technique for Command and Control, indicating that attackers often use common application layer protocols to communicate with their infrastructure.
       - T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a relevant technique for Exfiltration, indicating that data can be automatically transferred using various methods, including application layer protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the stolen data will not be sent over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.
     - **Supporting Evidence:**
       - T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is a relevant technique for Command and Control, indicating that attackers can use non-standard protocols to communicate with their infrastructure.
     - However, this does not necessarily mean that application layer protocols are not used for exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the attackers will use an application layer protocol to exfiltrate the stolen data. This is supported by the techniques T1071-Application Layer Protocol and T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
   - While T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is a valid technique, it is less commonly used for exfiltration compared to application layer protocols, which are more stealthy and less likely to be detected by network security measures.
