### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that, after gathering detailed victim information during the Discovery phase, the attackers' backdoor will collect screenshots as part of its extensive data collection capabilities before communicating the collected data with the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as hostname, OS details, user name, and MAC addresses.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots to collect visual information from the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The question mentions that the attackers have already gathered detailed victim information, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question then asks if the backdoor will collect screenshots, which aligns with the T1113-Screen Capture technique.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The question also mentions that the collected data will be communicated with the C&C server, which is a common step after data collection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the attackers have already performed the Discovery phase (T1082), it is logical that they would proceed to the Collection phase (T1113) to gather more detailed information, such as screenshots.
   - Collecting screenshots is a common and effective way to gather visual information that can be useful for further exploitation or reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor will collect screenshots as part of its extensive data collection capabilities before communicating the collected data with the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
