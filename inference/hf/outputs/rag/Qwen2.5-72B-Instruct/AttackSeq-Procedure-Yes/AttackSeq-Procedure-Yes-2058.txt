### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already stolen money from ATMs by using malicious software and manipulating the ATM operating system registry.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attackers used compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts and facilitate further lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to maintain persistent access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers could have used compromised domain administrator passwords to gain initial access to the network. This aligns with the T1078.002 technique.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Once inside the network, the attackers could have used the same domain administrator accounts to maintain persistent access. This also aligns with the T1078.002 technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The attackers could have used the compromised domain administrator accounts to move laterally within the network, potentially adding additional administrator accounts or using RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions. This aligns with the T1021.001 technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, it is plausible that the attackers used compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts and facilitate further lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
