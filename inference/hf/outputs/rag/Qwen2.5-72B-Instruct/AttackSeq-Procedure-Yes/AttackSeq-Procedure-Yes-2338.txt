### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a scheduled task is used to execute `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL every two hours. It then asks if it is likely that RevengeRAT will establish communication with C2 servers and send victim machine information to specific domains while the attacker's infrastructure is located in Canada and Brazil.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the attacker is using a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the victim's machine.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This suggests that the attacker is using a scheduled mechanism to transfer data from the victim's machine to the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This reinforces the use of a scheduled task for executing malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL aligns with the persistence and execution techniques (T1053.005).
     - The scheduled transfer technique (T1029) supports the idea that data is being exfiltrated to C2 servers.
     - The specific domains mentioned (`office365update[.]duckdns.org` and `systen32.ddns[.]net`) are consistent with the use of dynamic DNS services, which are often used by malware to maintain C2 communication.
     - The attacker's infrastructure being located in Canada and Brazil is plausible, as attackers often use geographically diverse infrastructure to evade detection and attribution.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely, which contradicts the related TTPs and the common behavior of malware like RevengeRAT.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the description in the question. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
