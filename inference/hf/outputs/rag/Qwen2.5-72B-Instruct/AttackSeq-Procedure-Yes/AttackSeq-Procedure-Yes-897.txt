### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the delivery of KerrDown malware via malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading.
   - It asks whether it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros, and then use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1204.002 - Malicious File**
     - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Microsoft Office document, which can then execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros, and then use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.
     - This aligns with common tactics used in phishing attacks where attackers often include social engineering elements to trick users into enabling macros. The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload is also a known technique to obfuscate the malicious code and make it harder to detect.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Office document will not contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros, and will not use base64 blobs to execute the payload.
     - This is less likely because it is a common and effective tactic for attackers to include such instructions to increase the chances of the victim enabling macros, and using base64 encoding is a common method to obfuscate the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A. The use of an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros and the use of base64 blobs to execute the payload are common and effective techniques in such attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
