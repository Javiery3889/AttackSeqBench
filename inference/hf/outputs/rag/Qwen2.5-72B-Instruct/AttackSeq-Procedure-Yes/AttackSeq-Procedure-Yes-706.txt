### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT12 is likely to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic as part of defense evasion before connecting to specific URLs during the command and control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard encoding schemes (like Base64) to obfuscate command and control (C2) traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves encoding or encrypting files to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT12 will encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe traffic.
     - The related TTPs support this:
       - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding** indicates that APT12 might use standard encoding (like Base64) to obfuscate C2 traffic.
       - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File** suggests that APT12 might encode files to evade detection, which aligns with the idea of using different encoding patterns for different malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT12 will not encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib or use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe traffic.
     - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, which indicate that encoding and obfuscation are common techniques used by APT12.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT12 will encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe traffic as part of defense evasion before connecting to specific URLs during command and control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
