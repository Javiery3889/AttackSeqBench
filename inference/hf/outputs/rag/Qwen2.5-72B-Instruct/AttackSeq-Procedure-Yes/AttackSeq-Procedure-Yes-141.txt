### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.
     2. Shifting to using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.
     3. Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear legitimate or benign to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment):**
     - The question mentions exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique, as HWP files can be used as attachments in spearphishing emails to gain initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading):**
     - The question then mentions using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion. This aligns with the T1036 technique, as simplified PostScript syntax can be used to make the malicious EPS files appear benign and avoid detection.
   - **Targeting Specific Professions or Groups:**
     - The final step in the question involves targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection. This is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access and evading defenses, as it allows the attackers to gather specific information from targeted individuals.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the related TTPs. The initial access through HWP files, followed by defense evasion using EPS files, and then targeting specific groups with impersonated documents, is a logical and common attack sequence in cyber operations.
