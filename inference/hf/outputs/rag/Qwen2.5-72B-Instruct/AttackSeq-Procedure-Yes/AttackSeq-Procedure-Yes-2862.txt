### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a malicious 32-bit CCleaner binary from version 5.33.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Redirecting execution to malicious code.
     - Decrypting a two-stage payload.
     - Evading detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and modifying CBkdr.dll.
     - Establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel using an HTTPS POST request with system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding formats to obfuscate command and control traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain a C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:**
     - This technique involves embedding malicious payloads within legitimate files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Redirecting Execution and Decrypting Payload:**
     - The initial steps of redirecting execution to malicious code and decrypting a two-stage payload align with the T1027.009-Embedded Payloads technique. This is a common method to hide and execute malicious code.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and modifying CBkdr.dll are techniques used to evade detection. These actions can make the binary appear benign to security tools and analysts.
   - **Establishing C2 Channel:**
     - Using an HTTPS POST request to establish a C2 channel aligns with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1132.001-Standard Encoding techniques. HTTPS is a standard protocol that can be used to encode and obfuscate C2 traffic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the related TTPs. The malware first embeds and decrypts the payload, then evades detection, and finally establishes a C2 channel using standard encoding and multi-stage communication techniques.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
