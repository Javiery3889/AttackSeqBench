### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether KONNI malware, after communicating with its C2 infrastructure using HTTP connections hosted by 000webhost to register, upload, and download files, is likely to upload stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) to the C2 infrastructure as part of its exfiltration process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves the use of the same command and control (C2) channel that was used for initial communication to exfiltrate data from the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that KONNI malware will indeed upload stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.
     - Given the related TTPs, this aligns with the technique T1041, which describes exfiltration over the same C2 channel used for initial communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that KONNI malware will not upload stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.
     - This does not align with the related TTPs, as T1041 specifically mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the technique T1041, it is likely that KONNI malware will upload stolen data to the C2 infrastructure as part of its exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
