### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk (defense evasion).
     - Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process (process injection).
     - Connecting the RAT back to its control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com (command and control).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a command and control server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique is used to evade detection by injecting code into a process, which can help the payload remain in memory without touching the disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely for the attackers to connect the RAT back to its control server using the domain chickenkiller.com.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The T1055-Process Injection technique is used for both privilege escalation and defense evasion, which aligns with the described actions of injecting the RAT payload into a new process and keeping it in memory.
       - The T1071.004-DNS technique is specifically about using DNS for command and control, which fits the scenario of connecting the RAT back to a control server.
       - Free dynamic DNS services like chickenkiller.com are commonly used by attackers to host their command and control servers because they are inexpensive and can be easily changed if detected.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely for the attackers to connect the RAT back to its control server using the domain chickenkiller.com.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, particularly T1071.004-DNS, which explicitly mentions using DNS for command and control.
       - It is common for attackers to use free dynamic DNS services for their command and control infrastructure, making this choice less plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis of the related TTPs and the described attack sequence, the most plausible answer is that the attackers are likely to connect the RAT back to its control server using the domain chickenkiller.com.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
