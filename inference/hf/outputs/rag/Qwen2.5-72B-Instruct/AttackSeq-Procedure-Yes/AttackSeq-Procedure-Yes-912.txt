### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the FAKEM RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is likely to use encryption to disguise its network traffic as standard protocol traffic (for defense evasion) before taking snapshots of the desktop (as part of its collection activities).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves making network traffic appear as if it is from a standard protocol or service to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves making malicious files, processes, or other system entities appear legitimate or benign.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the FAKEM RAT will use encryption to disguise its network traffic as standard protocol traffic before taking snapshots of the desktop.
     - **Evaluation:**
       - **T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation** aligns with the idea of disguising network traffic to look like standard protocol traffic.
       - **T1113-Screen Capture** aligns with the idea of taking snapshots of the desktop.
       - **T1036-Masquerading** is not directly related to network traffic but is a defense evasion technique that could be used in conjunction with other techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the FAKEM RAT will not use encryption to disguise its network traffic as standard protocol traffic before taking snapshots of the desktop.
     - **Evaluation:**
       - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, particularly T1001.003, which specifically mentions protocol impersonation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the evaluation, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the FAKEM RAT will use encryption to disguise its network traffic as standard protocol traffic before taking snapshots of the desktop.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
