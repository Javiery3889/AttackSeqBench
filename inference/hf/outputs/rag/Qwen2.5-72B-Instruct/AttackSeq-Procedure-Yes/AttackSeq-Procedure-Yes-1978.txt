### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access phase where emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT are sent.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending emails with links to malicious content, which aligns with the initial access phase described in the question.
   - **T1584.004 - Server:** This technique involves compromising web servers to host malicious content, which is relevant to the Resource Development phase.
   - **T1587 - Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing and maintaining the infrastructure and tools needed for an attack, which also aligns with the Resource Development phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The use of spearphishing emails with links to ENVYSCOUT is a common initial access technique (T1566.002).
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Compromising webservers to host delivery scripts (T1584.004) and using VPSs to host C2 infrastructure (T1587) are typical steps in the Resource Development phase.
     - These actions are often taken to ensure the adversary has a reliable and stealthy way to deliver and control the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions described, it is highly likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
