### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Whitefly will use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines after the discovery phase and before targeting desired data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to bypass security measures, which can be used during the initial infection and further compromise.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting and using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase (T1018-Remote System Discovery):** Whitefly has already mapped the network and identified potential targets.
   - **Exploitation (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion):** Whitefly has used publicly available tools and exploited vulnerabilities to infect further computers.
   - **Stolen Credentials (T1589.001-Credentials):** After gaining initial access and mapping the network, it is common for attackers to collect and use stolen credentials to move laterally within the network and compromise additional machines.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack pattern:
     1. **Discovery:** Whitefly maps the network to identify potential targets.
     2. **Exploitation:** Whitefly uses publicly available tools and exploits vulnerabilities to gain initial access and infect further computers.
     3. **Credential Harvesting:** Whitefly collects stolen credentials from the compromised systems.
     4. **Lateral Movement:** Whitefly uses the stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.
     5. **Data Targeting:** Whitefly then targets the desired data to expand control within the organization.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
