### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether an attacker is likely to confirm communication with the target device via a ping command before attempting lateral movement using the `net use` command.
   - The context involves using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers for communication with infected devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to access and control remote systems, often through administrative shares.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:**
     - This technique involves checking the internet connection status of the target system, which can be done using various methods, including ping.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Confirming communication with the target device via a ping command before attempting lateral movement is a common practice. Ping is a simple and effective way to check if a target is reachable and responsive.
     - After confirming the target is reachable, the attacker can proceed with more complex operations like lateral movement using `net use`.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the attacker does not check the target's reachability before attempting lateral movement.
     - While it is possible to attempt lateral movement without a ping, it is generally less efficient and more likely to fail if the target is not reachable.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the attacker would confirm communication with the target device via a ping command before attempting lateral movement using the `net use` command.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
