### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Shuckworm is likely to use `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions after executing malicious VBS scripts and deploying a custom backdoor, and before using HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.005-Mshta:**
     - This technique involves using `mshta.exe` to execute scripts or download and execute code, which can help bypass application control solutions.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts (VBS) to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - Shuckworm has already executed malicious VBS scripts and deployed a custom backdoor. This aligns with the T1059.005-Visual Basic technique.
   - **Next Steps:**
     - The question asks if Shuckworm is likely to use `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions. This aligns with the T1218.005-Mshta technique.
   - **Final Actions:**
     - After bypassing application control solutions, Shuckworm would use HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading. This is a common sequence in many attack scenarios.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, it is plausible that Shuckworm would use `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions before employing HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
