### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker first uses registry queries (like `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue`) to collect system information.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attacker would use `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to discover process and thread information before moving on to command and control activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the attacker uses HTTP and HTTPS for command and control activities.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This indicates that the attacker uses registry queries to gather system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Queries (T1012)**: The use of `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` aligns with the T1012 technique, which is part of the Discovery tactic. This is a common initial step for attackers to gather information about the system they are targeting.
   - **Process and Thread Information**: The use of `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` is more aligned with the Execution and Discovery tactics. These functions are typically used to manipulate and gather information about processes and threads, which can be useful for further exploitation or to understand the system's state.
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001)**: After gathering system information and possibly process/thread information, the attacker would likely move to establish command and control (C2) communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Discovery**: Use registry queries to gather system information.
     2. **Discovery**: Use `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to gather process and thread information.
     3. **Command and Control**: Establish C2 communication using HTTP and HTTPS.
