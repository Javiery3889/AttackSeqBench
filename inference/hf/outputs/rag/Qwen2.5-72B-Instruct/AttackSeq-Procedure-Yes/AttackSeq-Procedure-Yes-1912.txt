### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10, after gaining initial access through spear phishing emails, is likely to conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network before leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spear phishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves using spear phishing with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT10 is known to use spear phishing with malicious attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access to a network. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for advanced threat actors like APT10 to conduct internal reconnaissance to understand the network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement. This step is crucial for effective lateral movement and is a standard practice in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - APT10 is known to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement (T1534). This involves using internal spear phishing (T1534) to move between different segments of the network, including between MSPs and other victims.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the known behavior of APT10, it is highly likely that APT10 would conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
