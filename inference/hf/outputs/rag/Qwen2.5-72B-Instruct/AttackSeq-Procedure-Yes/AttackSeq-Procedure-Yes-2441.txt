### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Elise malware:
     - **Discovery:** Collects system information such as IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Communicates with a hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the malware collecting information about the system's network configuration, which aligns with the discovery phase described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves the use of web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with a C2 server, which aligns with the C2 phase described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol.
     - The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols supports this, as it specifically mentions the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol.
     - This does not align with the related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols, which indicates that web protocols are commonly used for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the Elise malware is likely to communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
