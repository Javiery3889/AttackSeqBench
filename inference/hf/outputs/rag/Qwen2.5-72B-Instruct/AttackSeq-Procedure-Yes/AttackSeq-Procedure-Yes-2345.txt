### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use a raw socket protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after collecting files using scripts named after various file extensions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001 - Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **T1095 - Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application-level communication, such as raw sockets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use a raw socket protocol for C2 communication, it would align with the T1095 technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If BRONZE PRESIDENT is not likely to use a raw socket protocol for C2 communication, it would align with the T1071.001 technique, which involves using standard web protocols.

4. **Context and Plausibility:**
   - The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT has already used scripts to collect files, which is part of the Collection phase. The next logical step would be to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - Raw socket protocols (T1095) are less common and more difficult to detect and block compared to standard web protocols (T1071.001). However, they are also more complex to implement and maintain.
   - Given that BRONZE PRESIDENT has already used scripts to collect files, it is more likely that they would use a more common and reliable method for C2 communication, such as web protocols, to ensure the data is exfiltrated successfully.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
