### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after gaining persistence by creating new user accounts with RSA keys for backdoor access, it is likely that attackers will use `chroot` to run processes outside the container while escalating privileges on the underlying host.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.005-Container Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying container services to maintain persistence.
   - **T1611-Escape to Host:** This technique involves escaping from a container to gain access to the underlying host.
   - **T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys:** This technique involves adding SSH keys to authorized keys files to maintain persistent access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys:** This technique is directly related to the initial part of the question, where attackers create new user accounts with RSA keys for backdoor access.
   - **T1543.005-Container Service:** This technique is related to maintaining persistence within a container, but it does not directly address the use of `chroot` or escaping to the host.
   - **T1611-Escape to Host:** This technique is directly related to the second part of the question, where attackers attempt to escape from the container to the underlying host.

4. **Evaluate the Use of `chroot`:**
   - `chroot` is a Unix command that changes the root directory for a process and its children. It is often used to create a sandboxed environment.
   - While `chroot` can be used to run processes in a restricted environment, it is not typically used to escape from a container to the underlying host. Instead, techniques like exploiting container vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are more common for escaping to the host.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining persistence with SSH keys, attackers would use techniques like T1611-Escape to Host to gain access to the underlying host, rather than using `chroot`.
