### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideWinder APT group:
     - Exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access.
     - Used malicious apps (Camero and FileCrypt Manager) as droppers.
     - Asks if the callCam app will collect account details during the discovery phase.
     - Asks if the collected data will be encrypted and prepared for exfiltration using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique describes how the APT group gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application (CVE-2019-2215).
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves using encryption or encoding to evade detection of malicious files.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:**
     - This technique involves archiving collected data using a custom method, which can include encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The APT group used CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access, which aligns with T1190.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of malicious apps (Camero and FileCrypt Manager) as droppers suggests an attempt to evade detection, which aligns with T1027.013.
   - **Collection:**
     - The question asks if the callCam app will collect account details during the discovery phase. This aligns with the Collection tactic.
     - The collected data is then encrypted and prepared for exfiltration using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, which aligns with T1560.003.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, it is likely that the callCam app will collect account details during the discovery phase and that the collected data will be encrypted and prepared for exfiltration using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
