### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor TA505:
     - Gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
     - Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
     - The question asks if it is likely that TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves adversaries using obfuscation or encoding to hide the true nature of their tools or commands. Base64 encoding is a common method used for this purpose.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Base64 Encoding for Defense Evasion:**
     - Base64 encoding is a common technique used to obfuscate data and evade detection by security tools. It is often used to hide the content of files or commands.
   - **TA505's Known TTPs:**
     - TA505 is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection, including the use of encoded commands and loaders.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question already includes the use of Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to execute Cobalt Strike Beacon. This suggests that TA505 is already employing encoding techniques for defense evasion.
   - **FlawedGrace RAT Loader:**
     - Given that TA505 is known to use FlawedGrace RAT and has a history of using encoded commands, it is plausible that they would store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings to further evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
