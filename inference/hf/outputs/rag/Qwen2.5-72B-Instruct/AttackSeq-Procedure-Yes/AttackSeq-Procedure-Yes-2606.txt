### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the NanHaiShu malware:
     - Gathering system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, User Name).
     - Uploading this information to a C&C server via HTTP POST.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will then receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial gathering of system information.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel, which is consistent with the HTTP POST method used to upload the initial system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Gathering and Upload:**
     - The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server. This aligns with the T1005 (Data from Local System) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) techniques.
   - **Receiving and Executing Additional Code:**
     - After the initial upload, it is common for malware to receive additional commands or scripts from the C&C server to perform further actions. This is a typical behavior in multi-stage attacks.
   - **Exfiltration of Sensitive Data:**
     - The T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) technique suggests that the malware is capable of automatically exfiltrating data, which can be facilitated by receiving and executing additional scripts.
   - **JScript and VBScript:**
     - JScript and VBScript are often used in malware to perform various tasks, including data exfiltration, due to their scripting capabilities and the ability to run on the target system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, it is highly likely that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
