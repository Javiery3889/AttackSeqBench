### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where RogueRobin executed a PowerShell script that was obfuscated using the COMPRESS technique from the Invoke-Obfuscation tool and employed sandbox detection methods for Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1027.010-Command Obfuscation, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic. This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1555.002-Securityd Memory**
     - This technique involves stealing application access tokens, which is not directly related to obfuscation or sandbox detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves modifying or subverting trust controls, which is not directly related to obfuscation or sandbox detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.011-Ignore Process Interrupts**
     - This technique involves ignoring process interrupts to evade detection, which is related to Defense Evasion but not specifically to obfuscation or sandbox detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection, which is closely related to the obfuscation of commands and can be used in conjunction with sandbox detection methods to further evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after obfuscating the PowerShell script, the next step would be to encode the data to further evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
