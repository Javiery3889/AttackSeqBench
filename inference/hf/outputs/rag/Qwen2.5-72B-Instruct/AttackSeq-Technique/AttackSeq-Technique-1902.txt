### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before the use of iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details.
   - The context involves a coin miner being executed and the use of a web service (iplogger.org) for tracking.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which is not directly related to tracking infected hosts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could be useful before tracking infected hosts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with the attacker, which aligns with the use of iplogger.org.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1542.004-ROMMONkit:** This technique involves modifying firmware to persist across reboots, which is not directly related to the context of tracking infected hosts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network connections, which could be useful for understanding the network environment but is not directly related to tracking infected hosts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which is more related to the initial stages of an attack rather than tracking infected hosts.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves discovering accounts on the system, which could be useful for gaining further access but is not directly related to tracking infected hosts.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves the attacker first discovering system information (T1082) to understand the environment before using a web service (T1102) to track the infected hosts.
   - The use of iplogger.org to track infected hosts and obtain their details aligns with the Command and Control tactic, specifically the Web Service technique (T1102).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery

However, based on the context and the related TTPs, the most appropriate answer is:
Final Answer: T1082-System Information Discovery

But since T1082 is not one of the answer choices, the closest and most plausible answer is:
Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
