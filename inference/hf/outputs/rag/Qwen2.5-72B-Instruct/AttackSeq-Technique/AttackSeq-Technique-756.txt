### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious XLS macro downloads and installs the SunSeed malware, which then establishes a connection to an actor-controlled staging server.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure that the SunSeed malware automatically runs at Windows startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to control the malware, but it does not directly relate to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up the malware to run automatically when the system boots or the user logs on, which is directly relevant to the question.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique is also about ensuring the malware runs at startup, which is again directly relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which is not related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique is directly related to ensuring the malware runs at startup, which matches the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the search order to execute a malicious file, which is not directly related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
