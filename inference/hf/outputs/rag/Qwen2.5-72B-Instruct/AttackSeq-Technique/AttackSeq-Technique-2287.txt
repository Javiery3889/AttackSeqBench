### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated Regin's capability to capture screenshots, control the mouse's point-and-click functions, and retrieve credential information during the collection phase.
   - The context is that this capability follows a discovery phase where information on processes and memory utilization was gathered.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1113-Screen Capture, which is part of the Collection tactic.
   - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which aligns with the capability to capture screenshots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**
     - This technique involves modifying the password filter DLL to capture credentials when they are changed. While it can capture credentials, it does not align with capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files. It is more related to initial access or execution, not the collection phase.
   - **C: T1560.002-Archive via Library**
     - This technique involves compressing data using a library. It is more related to exfiltration or data manipulation, not the collection of screenshots or credentials.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which can be used to retrieve credential information. It also aligns with the capability to control the mouse and capture screenshots, as it involves interacting with user input and screen content.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTP (T1113-Screen Capture) and the capabilities described in the question, the most plausible answer is D: T1056-Input Capture.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
