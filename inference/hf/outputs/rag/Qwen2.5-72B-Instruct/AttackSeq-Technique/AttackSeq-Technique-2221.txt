### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Earth Lusca used `adfind` and `PowerSploit` for reconnaissance to gather network configuration and domain information.
   - The next step in the sequence is the use of spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
   - These TTPs confirm that the final step in the sequence is the use of spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal**
     - This technique involves bypassing network address translation (NAT) to gain access to internal networks. It is not typically used in the reconnaissance phase or immediately before spear phishing.
   - **B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to establish trust and gain access. It is not typically used in the reconnaissance phase or immediately before spear phishing.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves exploiting mechanisms that control the elevation of privileges. It is typically used after gaining initial access to escalate privileges, not before spear phishing.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning the network to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. It is a common step in the reconnaissance phase and can occur after gathering network configuration and domain information but before sending spear phishing emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that active scanning (T1595) occurred after the reconnaissance with `adfind` and `PowerSploit` and before the spear phishing emails were sent.

**Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning**
