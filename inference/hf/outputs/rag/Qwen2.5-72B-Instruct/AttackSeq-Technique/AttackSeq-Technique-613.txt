### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers:
     - Used tools to download malware using BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service).
     - Deleted traces of their activity through batch files.
     - Conducted reconnaissance using brute-forcing and scanning tools to enumerate services, fingerprint remote servers, and authenticate on ports.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attacker's activity.
   - **T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using BITS to transfer files, which can be used to download malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.002-SAML Tokens**
     - This technique involves manipulating SAML tokens, which is not directly related to the described sequence of downloading malware and deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is typically an initial access technique and does not fit the sequence of downloading malware and deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036.010-Masquerade Account Name**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying account names to appear legitimate, which is a defense evasion technique but does not directly fit the sequence of downloading malware and deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which aligns with the described activity of deleting traces of the attacker's activity through batch files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used T1070-Indicator Removal to delete traces of their activity after downloading malware using BITS and before conducting reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
