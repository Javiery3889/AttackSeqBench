### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by a threat actor using PlugX.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing persistence by setting a registry Run key.
     - Utilizing EnumThreadWindows for defense evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred as part of the threat actor's communication with the C2 server between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**
     - This technique involves modifying the registry to evade detection or maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves setting registry run keys to ensure the malware runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection**
     - Process injection is a technique used to execute arbitrary code in the address space of a separate process. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not typically a communication technique with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a common method for establishing and maintaining communication with a C2 server.
   - **C: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**
     - This technique involves targeting a user by causing them to visit a malicious website. This is more relevant to the initial infection vector rather than communication with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
     - This technique involves communication that is unidirectional, often used to exfiltrate data or send commands. While it can be part of C2 communication, it is less common than using standard application layer protocols.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for communication with a C2 server is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is commonly used by malware to establish and maintain communication with a C2 server, fitting well into the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
