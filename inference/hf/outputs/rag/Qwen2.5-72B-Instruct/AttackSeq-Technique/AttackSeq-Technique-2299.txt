### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure.
   - The key points are:
     - The technique should be related to gathering information about the victim's network.
     - It should logically precede the redirection of traffic for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using various methods to hide their command and control infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which aligns well with the need to understand the network before redirecting traffic.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules:**
     - This technique involves hiding email rules, which is not directly related to network reconnaissance or traffic redirection.
   - **C: T1590.005-IP Addresses:**
     - This technique involves gathering IP addresses, which is a specific subset of network information and could be part of the broader network reconnaissance.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs, which is not directly related to network reconnaissance or traffic redirection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** (Choice A) is the most comprehensive and relevant technique for the initial stage of gathering information about the victim's network before redirecting traffic for reconnaissance.
   - **T1590.005-IP Addresses** (Choice C) is also relevant but is more specific and could be a subset of the broader network information gathering.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
