### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used encryption and mimicked legitimate network traffic to evade defenses.
   - The focus is on the communication between the malware and the command and control (C2) server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Command and Control
     - **Technique:** T1071.001-Web Protocols

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1657-Financial Theft**
     - This technique is related to stealing financial information, which is not directly relevant to the communication method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique is broader and includes the use of application layer protocols for communication. The specific sub-technique T1071.001-Web Protocols is mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the use of HTTP for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique is related to the use of symmetric cryptography, which is mentioned in the question but not the primary focus of the communication method.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
     - This technique is related to tricking users into clicking on malicious links, which is not relevant to the communication method described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** (specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols).

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
