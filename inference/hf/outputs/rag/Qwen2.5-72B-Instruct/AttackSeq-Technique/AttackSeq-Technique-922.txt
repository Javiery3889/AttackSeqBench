### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Volatile Cedar group:
     - Conducting vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers.
     - Using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after these initial steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems to identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system. This could be a plausible next step after identifying vulnerable web servers.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs as part of the initial access. It is not a subsequent step but rather the initial step.
   - **C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying:**
     - This technique involves ensuring that malware only executes in a specific environment. It is not directly related to spreading further into the network.
   - **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which is not typically a method used for spreading through a network after initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
     1. Conduct vulnerability scans (T1595.002).
     2. Exploit a public-facing application to gain initial access (T1190).
     3. Use the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.
     4. Exploit remote services to spread further into the network (T1210).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
