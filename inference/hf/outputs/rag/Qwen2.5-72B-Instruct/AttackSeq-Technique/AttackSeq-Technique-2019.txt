### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the Welcome Chat app ensures its functionality is activated at every device startup and then exfiltrates sensitive user data such as SMS messages, call logs, and other data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is relevant to the exfiltration of SMS messages.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is relevant to the exfiltration of call logs and other sensitive user data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is the final step in the described sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - **C: T1007-System Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering system services, which could be relevant to ensuring the app's functionality is activated at startup.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves discovering system information, which could also be relevant to ensuring the app's functionality is activated at startup.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The app needs to ensure its functionality is activated at every device startup. This likely involves discovering system services or system information to ensure the app is set to run at startup.
   - Between T1007 (System Service Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery), T1007 is more specific to the task of ensuring the app runs at startup.
   - After ensuring the app runs at startup, the app then exfiltrates sensitive user data, which aligns with the related TTPs T1005 (Data from Local System) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1007-System Service Discovery
