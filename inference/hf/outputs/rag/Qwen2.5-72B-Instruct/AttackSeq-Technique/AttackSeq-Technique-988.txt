### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the XAgent's InfoOS module gathering system information and the malware using the msgPacket structure to exfiltrate encrypted data to the C&C server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a victim's system to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as OS version, process lists, and other system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could be a step in the exfiltration process. However, it is more about the collection of data rather than the discovery of system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing data before exfiltration, which is not directly related to the discovery of system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on the system, which is a form of discovery but not specifically about system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves concealing the presence of malware or its activities, which is not directly related to the discovery or exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the InfoOS module gathers system information (T1082-System Information Discovery), the malware would then collect the data from the local system (T1005-Data from Local System) before exfiltrating it using the msgPacket structure.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1005-Data from Local System
