### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Higaisa group executed commands via `cmd /c ipconfig` for discovery purposes.
   - The context involves defense evasion tactics, specifically renaming `certutil.exe` to `gosia.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading files to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This sub-technique specifically involves renaming system utilities to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the execution of network configuration commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system's network configuration, which aligns with the use of `ipconfig` for discovery purposes.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not relevant to the execution of network configuration commands.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which is relevant to the execution of `cmd /c ipconfig`.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the technique that occurred before the execution of `cmd /c ipconfig` for discovery purposes.
   - The most relevant technique for discovering network configuration is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**.
   - The use of `cmd /c ipconfig` is a method to discover the system's network configuration, which aligns with T1016.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
