### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after a Listener was configured within Cobalt Strike to enable communication with the C2 server but before the attacker used reflective DLL injection to load the beacon.dll.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it is a common technique, it does not specifically fit the context of configuring a Listener and preparing for reflective DLL injection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
     - This technique involves using container orchestration tools to execute jobs. It is not relevant to the context of configuring a Listener and preparing for reflective DLL injection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. Configuring a Listener in Cobalt Strike to enable communication with the C2 server aligns well with this technique.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. It is not directly related to the context of configuring a Listener and preparing for reflective DLL injection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of configuring a Listener to enable communication with the C2 server, the most plausible technique that occurred in this sequence is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
