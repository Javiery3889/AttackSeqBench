### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the Tick group performed lateral movement using the `net use` command and before re-establishing connection with C2 servers using LODEINFO through HTTP POST communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control communications. While it is relevant to C2, it is not necessarily a step that would occur between lateral movement and re-establishing C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. It could be used to mask C2 communications but is not a necessary step between lateral movement and re-establishing C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. It is not directly related to the sequence of lateral movement and C2 re-establishment.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to maintain persistence. It is a plausible step that could occur after lateral movement and before re-establishing C2, as it ensures that the malware can re-establish C2 at a later time.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred between lateral movement and re-establishing C2 is the creation of a scheduled task or job to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
