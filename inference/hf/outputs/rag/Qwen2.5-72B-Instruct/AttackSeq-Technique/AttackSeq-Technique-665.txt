### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Reflective Loader with anti-analysis techniques is used for covert DLL injection.
   - The focus is on what technique is most likely used to maintain persistence on the victim system after the initial injection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting a DLL into a running process to execute code in the context of that process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up a mechanism to execute a program at system boot or user logon. This is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to credentials. While useful for gaining initial access, it is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect. It is more about evading detection rather than maintaining persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating a new user account on the system. While it can be used for persistence, it is less common and more detectable compared to other methods.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most likely technique to maintain persistence after using a Reflective Loader and DLL injection is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**. This technique aligns well with the goal of ensuring the malicious code runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
