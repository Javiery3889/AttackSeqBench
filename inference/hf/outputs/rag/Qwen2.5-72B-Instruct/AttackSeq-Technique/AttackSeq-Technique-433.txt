### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that the Sednit group's malware has achieved persistence through a Windows registry entry in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to perform reconnaissance on the victim computers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware has used the `T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder` technique for persistence.
   - This technique is part of the tactics "Privilege Escalation" and "Persistence."

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not typically a reconnaissance activity. It is more related to data exfiltration or credential access.
   - **B: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**
     - This technique involves checking for user activity to avoid detection, which is more related to evasion rather than reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is also more related to evasion rather than reconnaissance.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves actively scanning the network and system to gather information, which is a typical reconnaissance activity.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after achieving persistence through a registry entry would be to perform reconnaissance to gather information about the victim's environment.
   - Among the given choices, **T1595-Active Scanning** is the most relevant to the reconnaissance phase of the attack.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning
