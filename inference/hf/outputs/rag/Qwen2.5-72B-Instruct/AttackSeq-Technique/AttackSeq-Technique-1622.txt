### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used by APT28 after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems, specifically as part of the Discovery tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP ranges to identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their details to understand the network topology and potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique is not directly related to the Discovery of remote systems or network topology. It is more about discovering container and resource information, which is not the next logical step after scanning IP ranges.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique is related to exfiltrating data, which is a post-compromise activity and not part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.009-Proc Memory:** This technique involves process memory manipulation, which is typically used for persistence or privilege escalation, not for discovering remote systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique is directly related to the Discovery tactic and involves identifying remote systems and their details, which is the logical next step after scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in an attack, the most plausible answer is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
