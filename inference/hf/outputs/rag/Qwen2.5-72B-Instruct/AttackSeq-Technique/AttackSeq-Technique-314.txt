### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by BitterAPT to facilitate communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC servers after initially distributing malware through compromised websites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique is used for initial access, where the attacker compromises a website to deliver malware to victims.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the compromised system and the CnC server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. It is not relevant to the communication with CnC servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves using dynamic DNS or other methods to resolve CnC server addresses. It is relevant to maintaining communication with multiple CnC servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This is the same as B, so it is also relevant.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking victims into clicking on malicious links or attachments. It is not relevant to the communication with CnC servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both B and C are the same and are the most relevant to the question. They describe the use of dynamic resolution to maintain communication with multiple CnC servers.

**Final Answer: B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
