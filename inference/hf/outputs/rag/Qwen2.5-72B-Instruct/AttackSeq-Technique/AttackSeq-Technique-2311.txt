### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used lateral movement methods (SMB and PsExec) to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons across compromised systems.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves gathering information from platforms such as Microsoft SharePoint Online before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint:** This technique involves collecting data from SharePoint repositories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This is a broad category that includes various sub-techniques for collecting data from different types of information repositories.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1213.003-Code Repositories:** This sub-technique specifically involves collecting data from code repositories, which is not relevant to SharePoint.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546.011-Application Shimming:** This technique involves modifying the behavior of applications, which is not related to data collection from SharePoint.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems, which is a prerequisite for lateral movement but not the next step in the described sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for gathering information from Microsoft SharePoint Online is **T1213.002-Sharepoint**. This sub-technique is specifically designed to collect data from SharePoint repositories, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories

However, to be more precise, the most specific and relevant sub-technique is **T1213.002-Sharepoint**. Since the answer choices do not include this specific sub-technique, the closest and most appropriate choice is **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**.
