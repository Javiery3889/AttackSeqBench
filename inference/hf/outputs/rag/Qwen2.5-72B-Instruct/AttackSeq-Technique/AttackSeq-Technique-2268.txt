### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where email accounts have been exfiltrated through a POST web request.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it can be used to facilitate communication, it is not specifically related to the exfiltration of data or the use of PowerShell scripts.
   - **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile:** This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute code at startup. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data. While it is related to the collection of email accounts, it does not describe the communication method used to exfiltrate the data.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This is the most relevant technique for facilitating the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download malware and send collected data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of standard application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
