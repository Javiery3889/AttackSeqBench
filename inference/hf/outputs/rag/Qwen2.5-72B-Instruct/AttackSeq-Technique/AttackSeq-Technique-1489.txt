### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Babar's dropper uses global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications for logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves logging keystrokes to capture user input.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots to gather visual information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication:** This technique involves using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to communicate between processes. While this could be used in various stages of an attack, it is not directly related to the collection of keystrokes or screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump):** This technique involves dumping the Management Information Base (MIB) of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent. This is not related to the collection of keystrokes or screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which includes keylogging. Given that the dropper is already logging keystrokes, this technique is a direct continuation of the described activity.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves the use of domains in command and control (C2) communications. This is not directly related to the collection of keystrokes or screenshots.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described activity is that the dropper, after logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots, continues to capture user input.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique to occur next is **T1056-Input Capture**.

**Final Answer: C: T1056-Input Capture**
