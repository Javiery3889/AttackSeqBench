### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker first uses exported saved passwords from users' Chrome browser installations for Credential Access.
   - After this, the attacker demonstrates persistence using credential hopping and creating new O365 Service Principals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts in cloud environments to maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts in cloud environments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating a new account on a system. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely step immediately before using cloud accounts for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts. This is more relevant to on-premises environments rather than cloud environments.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves archiving data using a library. This is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This is a broader technique that includes using valid accounts, which can be in various environments, including cloud. Given the context of using cloud accounts for persistence, this is the most relevant choice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used valid accounts (T1078) to gain initial access and then used these accounts to create new O365 Service Principals for persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
