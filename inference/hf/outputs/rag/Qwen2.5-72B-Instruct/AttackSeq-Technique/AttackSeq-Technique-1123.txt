### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL.
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Deploying a renamed Microsoft component.
     2. Loading a malicious DLL.
     3. Establishing a simple remote command shell connecting to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages to establish and maintain command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL by hijacking the execution flow of a legitimate application.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is also about loading a malicious DLL to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1218.008-Odbcconf:** This technique involves using the ODBC Data Source Administrator to execute arbitrary code. It is not directly related to loading a malicious DLL or establishing a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for passive data collection. It is not directly related to loading a malicious DLL or establishing a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. While it is related to C2, it does not directly follow the deployment of a renamed Microsoft component and loading a malicious DLL.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves altering the execution flow of a legitimate application to load a malicious DLL. This aligns with the sequence of events described in the question, where a renamed Microsoft component is used to load a malicious DLL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL, the APT group would use a technique to hijack the execution flow to load the DLL. This is best represented by T1574-Hijack Execution Flow.

**Final Answer: D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
