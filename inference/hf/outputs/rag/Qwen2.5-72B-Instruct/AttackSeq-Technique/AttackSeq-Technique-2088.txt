### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after Carbanak conducted reconnaissance and before they downloaded and executed new payloads to move laterally in the infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can be part of the reconnaissance or collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target. It is not typically a step that occurs between reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to the target. While it can be part of the initial access phase, it is not typically a step that occurs between reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - **C: T1584.005-Botnet:** This technique involves using a botnet to conduct various malicious activities. It is not typically a step that occurs between reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - **D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which can be a crucial step after reconnaissance and before lateral movement. It allows the attacker to gain the necessary credentials to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred after reconnaissance and before lateral movement is **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**.

**Final Answer: D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
