### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an adversary performs discovery using in-memory tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit.
   - After discovery, the adversary establishes command and control (C2) by deploying an inline hook on an IIS request validation function.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the C2 establishment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes to understand the system's state.
   - **T1505.004-IIS Components:** This technique involves using IIS components for persistence, which aligns with the C2 establishment by hooking IIS request validation functions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager:** This technique involves stealing credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the discovery phase or the C2 establishment.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence. This is typically done to cover tracks and is not a prerequisite for C2 establishment.
   - **C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking an existing RDP session. This is not directly related to the discovery phase or the C2 establishment.
   - **D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternate credentials to gain access. This could be a step before establishing C2, but it is not as directly related to the discovery phase as the other options.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The discovery phase involves gathering information about the system, which is consistent with techniques like T1012 (Query Registry) and T1057 (Process Discovery).
   - After discovery, the adversary establishes C2 by hooking IIS components, which aligns with T1505.004 (IIS Components).
   - Among the answer choices, none directly match the discovery techniques, but the most plausible sequence would involve using alternate authentication material (T1550) to gain the necessary access before establishing C2.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material
