### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities: telnet dictionary attacks for credential access, communication with a C&C server, and then executing DDoS attacks.
   - We need to identify the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred during the communication with the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control communication.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel with the C&C server.
   - **T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service:** This technique involves causing a denial of service on an endpoint, which is part of the DDoS attacks mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into templates, which is not relevant to C&C communication.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which could be relevant but is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information, which is not directly related to C&C communication.
   - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for secure communication, which is relevant to C&C communication but not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The related TTPs suggest that the communication with the C&C server likely involved DNS (T1071.004) and bidirectional communication (T1102.002).
   - Among the answer choices, **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port** is the most plausible because it aligns with the need for secure and possibly stealthy communication with the C&C server, which is a common practice in such scenarios.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1571-Non-Standard Port
