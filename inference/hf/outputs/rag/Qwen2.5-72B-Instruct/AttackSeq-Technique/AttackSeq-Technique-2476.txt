### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique that facilitated the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 and the use of PowerShell for the Empire stager.
   - The exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 and the use of PowerShell are part of the execution phase, as indicated by the related TTPs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** Phishing is a technique used to trick victims into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. It is a common initial access technique.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. It is also a common initial access technique.
   - **C: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication:** This technique involves compromising network devices by exploiting authentication mechanisms. It is less likely to be the initial access method for client-side exploitation.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating new accounts on a system. It is typically used after gaining initial access and is not an initial access technique.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - **Phishing (T1566)** and **Drive-by Compromise (T1189)** are both plausible initial access techniques that could lead to the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 and the use of PowerShell.
   - **Phishing** is more commonly used to deliver client-side exploits, as it often involves tricking the user into opening a malicious document or visiting a malicious website.
   - **Drive-by Compromise** is also a valid method, but it typically involves compromising a website that the victim visits, which is less direct than phishing.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing
