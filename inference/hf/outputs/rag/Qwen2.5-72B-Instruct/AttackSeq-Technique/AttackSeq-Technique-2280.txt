### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware Regin has already collected system information and stolen data such as passwords. The next step is to encode the exfiltrated data and transmit it via HTTP-based C2 (Command and Control) using cookie data.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the exfiltration step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is Exfiltration, and the specific technique is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves the use of a C2 channel to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the description of transmitting data via HTTP-based C2 using cookie data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. While this can be useful for understanding the environment, it is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **B: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is more relevant to cloud environments and not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication**
     - This technique involves authenticating to network devices, which is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules, which can be used to load and execute additional components of the malware. This is more relevant to the preparation and execution of the exfiltration process, as it can help in encoding and transmitting the data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that before exfiltrating the data, Regin likely used shared modules to load and execute the necessary components for encoding and transmitting the data. This aligns with the need to prepare the data for exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
