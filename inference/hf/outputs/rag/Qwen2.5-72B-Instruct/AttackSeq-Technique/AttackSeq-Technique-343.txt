### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems before using dynamic resolution as a Command and Control (C2) technique during the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access to target systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves using dynamic resolution to obfuscate the C2 infrastructure, making it harder to detect and block.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for C2, but it is not typically used for initial access or to facilitate communication before dynamic resolution.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols for C2, but it does not directly relate to the initial access or supply chain compromise.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which is a key initial access method used in the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise. It is the most likely technique to have facilitated communication with compromised systems before dynamic resolution was used.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature:** This technique involves using an invalid code signature, which is more related to persistence and defense evasion rather than initial access or C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the supply chain compromise (T1195) facilitated initial access and communication with compromised systems before dynamic resolution (T1568) was used for C2.

**Final Answer: C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
