### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading to the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor by APT15.
   - Specifically, it focuses on what likely occurred after APT15 obtained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync:** This technique involves using the DCSync method to extract credentials from a domain controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not directly related to persistence or using credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts, which aligns with the use of domain administrator credentials obtained via Mimikatz.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546.008-Accessibility Features:** This technique involves using accessibility features for persistence, which is not directly related to the use of credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials:** This technique involves creating fake web credentials, which is not directly related to the use of domain administrator credentials.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, the next logical step for APT15 would be to use these valid credentials to maintain persistence in the network.
   - The use of valid domain accounts (T1078.002) is a common technique for achieving persistence and aligns well with the context provided.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1078-Valid Accounts
