### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events leading to initial access by APT28.
   - The sequence starts with bots scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.
   - After identifying vulnerable systems, APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
   - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with attachments (e.g., Word and Excel documents) to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1564.003-Hidden Window**
     - This technique involves hiding windows to avoid detection. It is not related to the initial scanning or spear phishing activities.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on target systems. This aligns with the bots scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.
   - **C: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves manipulating system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It is not related to the initial scanning or spear phishing activities.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This is the same as choice B and is the correct technique for the initial scanning activity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the bots geographically distributed across different countries scanned IP ranges and identified vulnerable systems, the next step was the use of spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to gain initial access.
   - The technique that best fits the initial scanning activity is T1595-Active Scanning.

**Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning**
