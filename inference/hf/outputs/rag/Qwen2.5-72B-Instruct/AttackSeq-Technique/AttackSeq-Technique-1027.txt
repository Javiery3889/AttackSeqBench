### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Gamaredon's malware scanned all drives to locate sensitive files, including local, removable, and network drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory locations on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1199-Trusted Relationship:** This technique involves leveraging a trusted relationship with another organization to gain access. It does not align with the context of scanning drives for sensitive files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1498.002-Reflection Amplification:** This technique involves amplifying network traffic to overwhelm a target. It is not related to the collection or discovery of files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. While it is related to network drives, it does not cover the broader context of scanning all drives, including local and removable drives.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1074-Data Staged:** This technique involves collecting and preparing data for exfiltration. After scanning all drives to locate sensitive files, the next logical step would be to stage the data for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after scanning all drives to locate sensitive files, the malware would stage the data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: T1074-Data Staged**
