### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the malware "ChChes" uses a code signing certificate to evade detection. After this, the malware communicates with its C&C servers to receive commands and modules.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur during this communication phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
   - This indicates that the initial step of using a code signing certificate is part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic, specifically the "Code Signing" technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into a network stream to manipulate or control the communication. It is not directly related to the communication with C&C servers for receiving commands and modules.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to protect the confidentiality of the communication. This is a common method for C&C communication to avoid detection.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is more related to the initial evasion phase (e.g., code signing) rather than the communication phase.
   - **D: T1205.001-Port Knocking**
     - This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port on a target system. It is not typically used for C&C communication but rather for initial access or port opening.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for the communication phase with C&C servers, especially to protect the communication from detection, is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
