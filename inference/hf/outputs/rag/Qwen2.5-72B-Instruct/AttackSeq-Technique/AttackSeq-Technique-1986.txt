### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary initially uses DLL Hijacking (T1574.001) to trick users into executing malware.
   - After gaining initial execution, the adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking, which is a technique used for initial execution.
   - The question asks about the next step in the attack sequence, specifically focusing on maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
     - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state, which is not related to maintaining persistence on a local system.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files, which is typically used to reveal the true nature of malware but is not a persistence mechanism.
   - **C: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
     - This technique involves using TFTP to boot a system, which is not a common method for maintaining persistence on a local system.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after initial execution via DLL Hijacking, the adversary would use a technique to maintain persistence, such as T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
