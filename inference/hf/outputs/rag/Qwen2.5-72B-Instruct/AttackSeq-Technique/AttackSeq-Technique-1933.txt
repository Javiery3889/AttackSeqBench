### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after `libchrome.exe` supported credential access by decrypting stored passwords from Local State and Login Data files.
   - The context is that the attacker has already gained access to credentials from web browsers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is `T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers`, which is part of the **Credential Access** tactic. This technique involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard. While it can be used to gather sensitive information, it is not typically a next step after credential access from web browsers.
   - **B: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment. This is generally an initial access technique and not a follow-up to credential access.
   - **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving data, which can be a step taken after collecting sensitive information, including credentials. However, it is not the most immediate next step after credential access.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. This is a common follow-up action after gaining initial access and credentials, as it can be used to maintain persistence and ensure the attacker can regain access later.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible next step after gaining credentials from web browsers would be to set up persistence. This is because the attacker would want to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is a common method for achieving persistence and aligns well with the scenario described.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
