### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses obfuscated batch scripts to evade antivirus detection and employs living-off-the-land techniques.
   - The final step involves writing five key files to disk for execution by targeting legitimate system processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing malicious files in a way that they appear legitimate to evade detection.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to execute it in the context of that process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL Side-Loading involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one. This could be a plausible technique, but it doesn't directly align with the description of writing files to disk and targeting legitimate processes.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1218.008-Odbcconf:**
     - Odbcconf is a legitimate system utility that can be abused to execute arbitrary code. However, it doesn't directly fit the context of writing files to disk and targeting legitimate processes.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - Scheduled Task/Job involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code. This technique is more about persistence and scheduling, not directly about writing files to disk and targeting legitimate processes.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - Process Injection involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. This aligns well with the description of writing files to disk and targeting legitimate processes. The related TTP T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection specifically mentions injecting code into a process, which fits the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used process injection to target legitimate system processes and write key files to disk for execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection**
