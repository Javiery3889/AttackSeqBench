### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers have already dumped Windows cached password hashes using PoisonIvy.
   - The next step in the sequence is to identify and move laterally to systems hosting sensitive intellectual property.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials:** This technique involves dumping cached domain credentials, which aligns with the initial step of dumping password hashes.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate and move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is also about using stolen credentials to evade detection and move laterally.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally. While it is a valid lateral movement technique, it does not specifically mention using stolen credentials or hashes.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the sequence of using dumped hashes for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials, including hashes, to authenticate and move laterally. This aligns well with the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools:** This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools, which is not relevant to the sequence of using dumped hashes for lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of using dumped password hashes to move laterally, is **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
