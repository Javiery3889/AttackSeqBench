### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an initial exploit (CVE-2015-5119) is used to save and execute a file (`%Temp%/Rdws.exe`).
   - This file then retrieves a second-stage payload (PlugX).
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the communication with C2 domains such as `inocnation[.]com`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This sub-technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not the most common or direct method for C2 communication in this context.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with C2 servers. This is a common method for C2 communication and aligns well with the described scenario.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a victim's system by having them visit a malicious website. This is not relevant to the communication with C2 domains after the initial exploit.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system. While it is a common post-exploitation activity, it does not directly relate to C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique for facilitating communication with C2 domains is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
