### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the Inception attackers gaining initial access by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word.
   - The key points are:
     - POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server.
     - The initial access is gained through CVE-2017-11882.
     - The exploit involves remote templates in Microsoft Word.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., Microsoft Word) to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into a template to evade detection and execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**
     - This technique involves exploiting trust relationships between networked systems. It does not align with the initial access through a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking compute resources, which is not relevant to gaining initial access through a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is a post-exploitation activity and not relevant to the initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gather information. While phishing can be a method to deliver a payload, it is not the primary method described in the question, which focuses on exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **T1221-Template Injection**: The attackers inject a malicious template into a Microsoft Word document.
     2. **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: The malicious template exploits CVE-2017-11882 to execute code.
     3. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: The exploit gains initial access to the system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1598-Phishing for Information

However, based on the provided related TTPs, the most accurate answer should be **T1221-Template Injection** as it directly aligns with the initial access method described. Since T1598-Phishing for Information is not listed in the related TTPs and does not fit the context as well, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1221-Template Injection** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most accurate based on the related TTPs.)
