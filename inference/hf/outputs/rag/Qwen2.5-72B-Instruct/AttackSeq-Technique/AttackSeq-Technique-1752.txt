### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses custom versions of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation and then establishes command and control via an inline hook within the IIS request handling process.
   - We need to determine what ATT&CK technique likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1127.001-MSBuild:** This technique involves using MSBuild to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute code. This is not directly related to the sequence described, as it does not fit the context of privilege escalation or command and control.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise. While this could be part of the attack, it is not a necessary step between privilege escalation and command and control.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1037.002-Login Hook:** This technique involves modifying the login process to execute arbitrary code. This is not directly related to the sequence described, as it does not fit the context of privilege escalation or command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to execute arbitrary code. This is not directly related to the sequence described, as it does not fit the context of privilege escalation or command and control.

4. **Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the context of using custom versions of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation and then establishing command and control, the most likely technique to occur between these actions is **T1055-Process Injection**. This technique is commonly used to inject code into a process to maintain persistence or to execute additional malicious actions, which fits well with the described sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1055-Process Injection**
