### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Sayad malware drops an information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll) and then ensures that the malware runs at startup using rundll32.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute code from a DLL. This is a common method for running malicious code at startup.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process. While this is a method for code execution, it is not specifically about ensuring the malware runs at startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC):** This technique involves injecting code into a process by queuing an APC. It is not related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking COM objects to execute malicious code. It is not specifically about ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automatically collecting data from the system. It is not related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up the malware to run automatically at system boot or user logon. This aligns with the scenario described in the question, where the malware ensures it runs at startup using rundll32.exe.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
