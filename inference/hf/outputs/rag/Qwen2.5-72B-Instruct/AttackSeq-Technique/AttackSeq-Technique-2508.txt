### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained remote access to hotel front desks and have already stolen credit card details.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves collecting additional data by monitoring OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites and hotel personnel activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is relevant to the initial data theft.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves gaining initial access through a drive-by compromise, which is not directly relevant to the collection of additional data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which could be used to monitor hotel personnel activities. However, it is more specific to capturing input rather than monitoring broader activities.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information through phishing emails or websites. It is not directly related to monitoring activities or collecting data from systems.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which could include monitoring OTA websites and other data sources. This aligns well with the need to collect additional data.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malicious software, which is not directly related to monitoring activities or collecting data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves collecting additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities. The technique that best fits this description is **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**.

**Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
