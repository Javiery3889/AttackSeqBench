### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Longhorn established persistence using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - The attack sequence includes avoiding detection using in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before these evasion techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise. While this is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not typically the first step in an attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver a payload, such as a Word document with a zero-day exploit. This is a plausible initial step in the attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type:** This technique involves disguising a file type to appear as a different type. While this can be used to avoid detection, it is not typically the first step in an attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate cloud accounts to gain access. This is not typically the first step in an attack sequence involving a zero-day exploit in a Word document.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible initial step in the attack sequence is the delivery of the payload via phishing. This aligns with the use of a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - After the initial compromise, the attacker would likely use in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
