### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Kingslayer uses a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion and employs a stolen code signing private key.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the deployment of this malware into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique involves using a stolen or legitimate code signing certificate to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate.
   - **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves using a time-based algorithm to evade detection, such as a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is not directly related to software subversion or the use of a stolen code signing key.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which is a common method for deploying malware into enterprise environments. It aligns well with the context of using a stolen code signing key to make the malware appear legitimate.
   - **C: T1021.005-VNC:** This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access, which is not relevant to the deployment of malware via software subversion.
   - **D: T1219-Remote Access Software:** This technique involves using remote access software, which is not directly related to the deployment of malware via software subversion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is facilitated by **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**. This technique aligns with the context of using a stolen code signing key to deploy malware into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

**Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
