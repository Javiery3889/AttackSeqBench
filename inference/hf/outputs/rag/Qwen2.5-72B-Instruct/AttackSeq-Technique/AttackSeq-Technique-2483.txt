### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the adversaries used reflective code loading to evade defenses during the attack.
   - Reflective code loading is a technique used to load and execute code in memory without writing it to the disk, which helps in evading detection by security software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique is used to load and execute code directly in memory, bypassing the need to write the code to disk.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) to hinder forensic analysis and incident response.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and command and control (C2). While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not directly related to the immediate aftermath of reflective code loading.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests to exfiltrate data or communicate with C2 servers. It is not directly related to the immediate aftermath of reflective code loading.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
     - This technique involves modifying conditional access policies to gain or maintain access to a network. It is not directly related to the immediate aftermath of reflective code loading.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system. It is not directly related to the immediate aftermath of reflective code loading.

   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique is directly related to the immediate aftermath of reflective code loading. After loading and executing code in memory, adversaries often remove or alter indicators of compromise to avoid detection and forensic analysis.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using reflective code loading to evade defenses, the adversaries would likely use indicator removal to further evade detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
