### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has already established communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and encoded with Base64.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to transfer collected data out of the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique is about deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is not directly related to exfiltration but is part of the broader attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves placing malicious components on a server to maintain persistence or to provide a foothold for further attacks. It does not directly relate to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique is directly related to the exfiltration of data over the same channel used for C2 communications, which matches the scenario described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts, which is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which is a different method of exfiltration and does not match the scenario of using the same C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
