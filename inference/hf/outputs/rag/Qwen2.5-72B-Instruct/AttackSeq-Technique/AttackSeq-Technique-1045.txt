### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker exploits Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for initial access, then moves laterally using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue vulnerability.
   - The question specifically asks which ATT&CK technique occurred as Emissary Panda identified vulnerable systems within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, such as Microsoft SharePoint, to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using stolen credentials and vulnerabilities in remote services (like EternalBlue) to move laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering file and directory structures on a system. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it is more focused on local file systems rather than network discovery.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which is a crucial step in identifying vulnerable systems within the network.
   - **D: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host, such as IP addresses, domain names, and system configurations. While it is useful for reconnaissance, it is more general and less specific to network service discovery.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of identifying vulnerable systems within the network, the most relevant technique is **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. This technique aligns with the need to identify network services and configurations that can be exploited, such as the EternalBlue vulnerability.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery
