### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by StellarParticle.
   - Specifically, it mentions that StellarParticle used AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory before accessing data from Information Repositories for collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the system owner and user information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not directly related to gathering information from Active Directory or accessing data from information repositories.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves ARP cache poisoning, which is a network attack and not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**: This technique involves collecting unsecured credentials, which is a logical step after gathering information from Active Directory. Active Directory often contains user and system information, and unsecured credentials can be a valuable target for collection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory, which is a discovery step.
   - After discovering information from Active Directory, the next logical step would be to collect unsecured credentials (T1552) to facilitate further access and data collection.
   - The final step mentioned in the question is accessing data from information repositories (T1213), which aligns with the collection tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1552-Unsecured Credentials
