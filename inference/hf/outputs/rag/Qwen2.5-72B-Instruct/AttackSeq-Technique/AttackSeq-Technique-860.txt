### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the use of scheduled system tasks with compromised credentials for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - Compromising administrator accounts.
     - Installing tools for privilege escalation.
     - Using scheduled system tasks with compromised credentials for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1053.002-At:** This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using the Task Scheduler to schedule tasks.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to perform actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
     - This technique involves using stolen password hashes to authenticate to a system.
     - It is a common method for lateral movement but does not directly relate to the initial compromise of administrator accounts or the installation of tools for privilege escalation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather credentials.
     - While it can be used to gather credentials, it is not typically used for privilege escalation or scheduling tasks.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to a system.
     - It is a broader category that includes various methods of using stolen credentials, which aligns well with the use of compromised credentials for scheduling tasks.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1585-Establish Accounts**
     - This technique involves creating new accounts on a system.
     - It is not directly related to the use of compromised credentials or scheduling tasks.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first compromised administrator accounts (likely using a technique like T1056-Input Capture or T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material) and then used these compromised credentials to schedule tasks for lateral movement.
   - Among the given choices, **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material** (Answer Choice C) is the most appropriate because it directly involves using stolen credentials, which is a necessary step before scheduling tasks with those credentials.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material
