### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a vulnerability in Microsoft Office is exploited to install malware (Taidoor) on the target's system.
   - After the installation, Taidoor begins beaconing to a CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which is part of the Execution tactic. This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a CnC server. While this is relevant to the beaconing part, it does not describe the initial exploitation of the vulnerability.
   - **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools, which is not directly related to exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to deliver a payload. Phishing is a common method to get a user to open a malicious document, which can then exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - **D: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**
     - This technique involves accessing cloud instance metadata, which is not relevant to the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first uses phishing (T1566) to deliver a malicious document to the target. When the target opens the document, the vulnerability in Microsoft Office is exploited (T1203), leading to the installation of Taidoor. After installation, Taidoor begins beaconing to the CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern (T1071).

### Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing
