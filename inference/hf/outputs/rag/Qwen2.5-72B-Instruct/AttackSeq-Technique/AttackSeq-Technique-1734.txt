### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already achieved credential access using tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
   - The attacker then used 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks to perform lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to map databases, servers, and open ports within the target networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is used to authenticate to a remote system using a hash of a password instead of the password itself.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique is used to evade detection by using stolen credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active network connections and open ports on the internet. It is not specific to mapping internal network resources.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves collecting and analyzing log files to gather information. It is not directly related to mapping network resources.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials, which is already part of the described sequence (pass-the-hash). It does not map network resources.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active services and open ports on the network. It is directly related to mapping internal network resources such as databases, servers, and open ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using network service discovery to map internal network resources after achieving credential access and performing lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
