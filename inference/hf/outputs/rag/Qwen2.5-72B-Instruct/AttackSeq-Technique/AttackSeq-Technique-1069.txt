### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has collected and exfiltrated system information and screenshots to an attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - The communication with the server is using HTTP on port 443.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using a non-standard port for command and control (C2) communication. However, the question specifies that the communication is using port 443, which is a standard port for HTTPS.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. This is relevant because the data is being exfiltrated to a server, which is likely the same server used for C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which could be relevant if the Mattermost server is being used as a web service for exfiltration.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service for command and control. While it is related to web services, it does not specifically address the exfiltration aspect.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves tunneling one protocol inside another, which is not directly relevant to the scenario described.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up persistence at boot or logon, which is not relevant to the communication or exfiltration described in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique is **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** because it directly addresses the exfiltration of data over a web service, which fits the scenario of exfiltrating data to a Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
