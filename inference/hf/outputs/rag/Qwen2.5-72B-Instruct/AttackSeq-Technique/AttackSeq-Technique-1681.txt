### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan is used to establish communication with a C&C server over TCP port 80.
   - The focus is on the initial stage of the attack, specifically how the attackers delivered the malicious attachments to the target.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique is about using non-standard ports for C&C communication. However, the question specifies that the communication is over TCP port 80, which is a standard port (HTTP).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1074-Data Staged**
     - This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration, which is not relevant to the initial delivery of the malicious attachment.
   - **B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content. This is a plausible method for delivering the PoisonIvy backdoor.
   - **C: T1098.006-Additional Container Cluster Roles**
     - This technique is related to cloud environments and is not relevant to the initial delivery of a backdoor via email.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves sending phishing emails, which is a broader category that includes spearphishing. While it is a valid choice, the more specific technique (B) is more appropriate.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used spearphishing to deliver the malicious attachment.

**Final Answer: B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
