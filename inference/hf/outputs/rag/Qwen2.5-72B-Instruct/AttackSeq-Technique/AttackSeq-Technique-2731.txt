### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Lazarus group:
     - Network share discovery
     - Process discovery
     - System network configuration discovery
     - Lateral movement using WMIC and compromised router virtual machines
   - We need to determine the next logical step in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1135-Network Share Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network shares and resources that can be accessed by the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC):** This technique involves using WMIC to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the owner or user of a system. While this could be useful, it is not the most immediate next step after discovering network shares and configurations.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving data for exfiltration. This is typically a later step in the attack sequence, not immediately after discovery.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations. This is a logical next step after discovering network shares and configurations, as it helps the attacker understand the services running on the network and potential entry points for further exploitation.
   - **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities:** This technique involves preparing and staging tools and capabilities for use in the attack. While this is a necessary step, it is not the immediate next step after discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible next step after network share, process, and system network configuration discovery is to perform network service discovery to identify potential new targets for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
