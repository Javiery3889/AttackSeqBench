### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before Energetic Bear gained initial access to Turkish critical infrastructure through a watering hole attack by compromising a supply chain website.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access was gained through a watering hole attack.
     - The supply chain website was compromised.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary compromising a third-party supply chain to gain access to the target.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique aligns with the scenario where the supply chain website was compromised. The adversary likely compromised the supply chain website to set up the watering hole attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1187-Forced Authentication**
     - This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a service controlled by the adversary. It does not fit the context of a supply chain compromise or a watering hole attack.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**
     - This technique involves using LNK files to smuggle icons and execute malicious code. It is not relevant to the initial access through a supply chain compromise or a watering hole attack.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is not mentioned in the scenario. The scenario specifically mentions a supply chain website, not hardware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the supply chain website was compromised first, which then led to the watering hole attack.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before Energetic Bear gained initial access is **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**.

Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
