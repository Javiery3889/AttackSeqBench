### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malware:
     - Executes a fake decoy document using the RichEdit function.
     - Evades defenses by protecting shellcode in memory through hijacking a DLL using localAlloc and VirtualProtect.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading a DLL or executable directly into memory without using the Windows loader.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves executing a malicious DLL by hijacking the loading process of a legitimate application.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process by loading a DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying a system process, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **T1525-Implant Internal Image:** This technique involves embedding malicious code within a legitimate file, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **T1070.005-Network Share Connection Removal:** This technique involves removing network share connections, which is not directly related to the sequence described.

   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique could be used to load the shellcode into memory without using the Windows loader, which aligns with the evasion technique described.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves hijacking a DLL, which aligns with the evasion technique described.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which could be used to protect the shellcode in memory.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves executing a decoy document and then protecting shellcode in memory through DLL hijacking.
   - The most plausible technique that fits between these two events is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**. This technique involves hijacking a DLL, which is a common method for evading defenses and aligns with the use of localAlloc and VirtualProtect to protect the shellcode in memory.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
