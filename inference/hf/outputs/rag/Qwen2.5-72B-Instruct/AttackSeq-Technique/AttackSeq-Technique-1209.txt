### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where PyFlash gathers system information using commands like `systeminfo` and `tasklist`.
   - After gathering this information, PyFlash communicates with a hardcoded command and control (C2) server using HTTP.
   - The communication is encrypted using AES-128 in CBC mode.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Command and Control
     - **Technique:** T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.001-Web Cookies**
     - This technique involves collecting web cookies, which is not relevant to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
     - This technique involves one-way communication, which is not specified in the question. The question implies two-way communication (sending and receiving data).
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels for communication, which aligns with the description of using AES-128 in CBC mode for encrypting communications.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
