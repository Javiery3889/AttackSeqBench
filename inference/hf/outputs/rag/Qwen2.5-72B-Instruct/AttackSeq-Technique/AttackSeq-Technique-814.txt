### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Sofacy (a known threat actor) uses spear phishing emails containing malicious links to deploy malware.
   - After deploying the malware, Sofacy establishes connections to its infrastructure using domains, likely to evade network detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious websites to gain initial access to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a broader category that includes various types of phishing techniques. While it is relevant to the initial access phase, it does not specifically address the subsequent step of establishing connections to infrastructure.
   - **B: T1001.002-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other files or network traffic. While it can be used for evasion, it is not typically used for establishing connections to infrastructure.
   - **C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to establish a connection to a command and control (C2) server. It is a method of network communication that can help evade detection.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to communicate with C2 servers. It is a common method for establishing connections and can be used to evade network detection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question specifically mentions establishing connections to infrastructure using domains for potential network detection evasion.
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** and **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** are both relevant to this step.
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** is more specific to the use of domains and dead drops, which aligns well with the described scenario.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is a more general technique that can be used in various contexts, but it is also a plausible choice.

Given the specific mention of using domains for evasion, **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** is the most precise and relevant technique.

### Final Answer: C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver
