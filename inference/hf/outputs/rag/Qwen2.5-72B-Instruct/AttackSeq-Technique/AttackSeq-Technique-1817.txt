### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique used by Earth Wendigo to evade detection before stealing username and password pairs via intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API.
   - The focus is on evasion through indirect script execution using the webmail system's features.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (Tactic: Execution):** This technique involves using legitimate command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service (Tactic: Initial Access):** This technique involves using spearphishing through a service, such as email, to gain initial access to a system.
   - **T1036-Masquerading (Tactic: Defense Evasion):** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it can be used for evasion, it does not specifically address indirect script execution through the webmail system's features.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It is more about concealing evidence rather than executing scripts indirectly.
   - **C: T1491-Defacement:** This technique involves altering or defacing web pages. It is not relevant to the context of evading detection through script execution.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. It is not relevant to the context of evading detection through script execution.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for evading detection through indirect script execution using the webmail system's features is **T1036-Masquerading**. This technique allows the attacker to rename or masquerade malicious scripts to appear legitimate, thereby evading detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1036-Masquerading**
