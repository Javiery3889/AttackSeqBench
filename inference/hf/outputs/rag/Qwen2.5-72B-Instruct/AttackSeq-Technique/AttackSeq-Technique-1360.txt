### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities where an executable file "Rdws.exe" is downloaded and executed, leading to C2 (Command and Control) communication with specific domains.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely preceded these activities to initially gain access to the system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain C2.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. While this could be used for C2 communication, it does not describe the initial access method.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. This is a common method for initial access and aligns well with the scenario described.
   - **T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie:** This technique involves stealing web session cookies to gain access to web applications. While this can be used for initial access, it is less likely in the context of downloading and executing a file.
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access to a system. While this can be used for initial access, it is less likely in the context of downloading and executing a file from a public domain.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the initial access was gained by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which then led to the download and execution of "Rdws.exe" and subsequent C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
