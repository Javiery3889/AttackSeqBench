### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the threat actor uses stolen credentials to persist via VPN access and then configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the threat actor achieved persistence by configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves the use of legitimate credentials to gain access to systems.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves the use of remote services like VPNs to gain access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear benign. This is not directly related to the use of stolen credentials or remote access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. This is typically an initial reconnaissance activity and not directly related to the use of stolen credentials or remote access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services like VPNs to gain access to a network. This aligns with the use of stolen credentials to persist via VPN access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves the use of legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. This is a prerequisite for using external remote services and aligns with the use of stolen credentials.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using stolen credentials to persist via VPN access. This implies that the threat actor first obtained valid accounts (T1078) and then used those accounts to access the network via external remote services (T1133).
   - The most logical sequence is that the threat actor first obtained valid accounts (T1078) and then used those accounts to access the network via external remote services (T1133) before configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts
