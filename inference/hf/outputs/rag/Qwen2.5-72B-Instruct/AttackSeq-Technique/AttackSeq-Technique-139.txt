### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an APT group (APT-TOCS) downloads Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell, maintains multi-beacon communication for evasion, and then establishes secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves collecting and analyzing log files, which is not directly related to establishing secure communication or maintaining multi-beacon communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting languages to execute commands, which is relevant to the initial download of Shellcode via PowerShell but not to the secure communication part.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves using symmetric encryption to secure communication, which is a method of encryption but not specifically about the communication protocol.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to secure communication, which aligns with the use of HTTP GET requests to specific URLs for secure communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests, is the use of an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
