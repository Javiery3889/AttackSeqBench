### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials were used to compromise Japanese companies in various sectors.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems, which can help in maintaining persistence and evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique is also about using valid accounts to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control compromised systems, which can include the use of proxies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or clipboard data. While this could be used to gather credentials, it is not directly related to the use of hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials in the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205.002-Socket Filters:** This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This is not directly related to the use of hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture:** This is a duplicate of Answer Choice A and can be disregarded.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. Given that the backdoors have hardcoded proxy addresses, this technique is highly relevant. It aligns with the use of proxies to maintain command and control over the compromised systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used hardcoded proxy addresses to maintain command and control over the compromised systems.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
