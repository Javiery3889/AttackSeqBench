### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where ATMitch reads commands from a file in the 'c:\intel' folder during Command and Control.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to interact with ATM drivers and dispense money using the 'msxfs.dll' library.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, but it does not specifically describe the interaction with ATM drivers or the use of 'msxfs.dll'.
   - **T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious activities, but it does not specifically relate to interacting with ATM drivers.
   - **T1489-Service Stop:** This technique involves stopping services to disrupt the system, but it does not describe the interaction with ATM drivers or the use of 'msxfs.dll'.
   - **T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves scheduling tasks using cron jobs, which is not relevant to interacting with ATM drivers or the use of 'msxfs.dll'.

   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process by loading a dynamic-link library (DLL). This is highly relevant to the scenario described, as it involves interacting with ATM drivers and using the 'msxfs.dll' library to dispense money.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**.

Final Answer: **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
