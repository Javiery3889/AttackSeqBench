### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability was exploited to gain a foothold in the victim's network.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to secure alternative means of access to maintain control over the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is used to gain initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the initial attack described.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to the network, which is a common method for securing alternative means of access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique is also listed under Initial Access, indicating that valid accounts can be used to gain initial access as well as to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information, which is not relevant to securing alternative means of access.
   - **B: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to maintain persistence, which is a plausible method for securing alternative means of access.
   - **C: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating new user accounts, which is another method for securing alternative means of access.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves phishing to gather information, which is not directly related to securing alternative means of access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts** is the most relevant technique for securing alternative means of access, as it involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task** and **T1136-Create Account** are also relevant, but **T1078-Valid Accounts** is more directly aligned with the context of maintaining control over the compromised systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1136-Create Account** 

However, if we strictly follow the related TTPs and the context of maintaining control, **T1078-Valid Accounts** is the most accurate choice. Since **T1078-Valid Accounts** is not listed as an answer choice, **C: T1136-Create Account** is the next best option.
