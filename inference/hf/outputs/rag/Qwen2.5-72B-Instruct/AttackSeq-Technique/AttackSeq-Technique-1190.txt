### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Execution tactic involving malicious macros downloading payloads.
   - The focus is on what happens after the initial execution of the malicious macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1204.002-Malicious File, which is part of the Execution tactic. This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, which is part of the initial execution phase. However, the question asks about what happens after the initial execution, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it can be part of a post-execution activity, it is not typically the immediate next step after downloading a payload.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malicious code is executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is a common next step after initial execution to maintain persistence.
   - **D: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
     - This technique involves using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to boot a system. This is not a common next step after initial execution and is more related to network booting and initial system setup.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial execution of malicious macros, the attacker would likely set up persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware runs automatically on boot or logon.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
