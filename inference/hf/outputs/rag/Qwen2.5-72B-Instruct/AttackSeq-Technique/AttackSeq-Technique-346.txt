### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors gain initial access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique.
   - After gaining access, the threat actors execute code using system services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party software supply chain to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This sub-technique specifically refers to compromising the software supply chain to deliver malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. While it is a common post-compromise activity, it does not directly relate to executing code using system services.
   - **B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This sub-technique involves removing or modifying artifacts that indicate the presence of persistence mechanisms. It is not relevant to the execution of code using system services.
   - **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT:** This sub-technique involves using AutoHotKey or AutoIT scripts to execute code. While it can be used to execute code, it is not specifically related to using system services.
   - **D: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to execute code. This is directly relevant to the scenario described in the question, where the threat actors execute code using system services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves using system services to execute code after gaining initial access through a compromised software update.

**Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services**
