### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Linux Turla sample intercepted incoming packets without root access and executed commands via `/bin/sh -c`.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this sequence of actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell**: This technique involves the use of Unix shell commands to execute other commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using legitimate protocols or traffic to blend in with normal network traffic to communicate with a command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**: This technique involves manipulating the PATH environment variable to execute malicious code. While this could be a method to achieve execution, it does not directly follow the described sequence of intercepting packets and executing commands via `/bin/sh -c`.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. While this could be a subsequent action, it does not directly follow the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to run at specific times using cron jobs. This could be a method to maintain persistence, but it does not directly follow the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands or scripts. The described sequence already involves executing commands via `/bin/sh -c`, which is a Unix shell command. Therefore, this technique is the most directly relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described scenario is that the Linux Turla sample executed commands via `/bin/sh -c`, which aligns with the **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
