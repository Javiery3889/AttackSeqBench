### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.
   - The key points are:
     - Communication with the C&C server.
     - Use of encrypted and hex-encoded data.
     - Commonly used ports.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to network defenses.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports to communicate with the C&C server to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the encoding or encryption of data.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's machine. It is not related to establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control communications. This aligns well with the use of encrypted and hex-encoded data.
   - **D: T1547.012-Print Processors:**
     - This technique involves modifying print processors to achieve persistence. It is not related to establishing communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using an encrypted channel (T1573) to protect the communication with the C&C server. This aligns with the use of encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
