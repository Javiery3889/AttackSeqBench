### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving an Explosive Trojan that dynamically unloads an Explosive DLL after completing a desired action and then leverages keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
   - Both TTPs are related to keylogging, which is a technique used to capture keystrokes to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and command and control. It does not directly relate to the sequence of unloading a DLL and then keylogging.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the sequence of unloading a DLL and then keylogging.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
     - This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk. While it could be used to load the Explosive DLL, it does not fit the sequence of unloading the DLL and then keylogging.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It is plausible that the attacker would hide the artifacts of the unloading DLL to avoid detection before proceeding with keylogging.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred after unloading the DLL and before keylogging is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique helps the attacker avoid detection, which is a logical step before proceeding with keylogging to obtain administrator passwords.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
