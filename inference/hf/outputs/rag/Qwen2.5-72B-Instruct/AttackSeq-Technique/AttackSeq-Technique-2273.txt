### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Regin utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.
   - The key points are:
     - Regin used encrypted data blobs.
     - These blobs were stored in non-traditional file storage areas.
     - The goal was to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique involves storing data in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using resource forks to store data in a way that is not easily detected by standard file system tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make them harder to detect.
     - While this is related to evasion, it does not specifically address the use of non-traditional file storage areas.
   - **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:**
     - This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate processes to execute malicious code.
     - This is not directly related to the storage of encrypted data blobs.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen.
     - This is not related to the storage or evasion of data.
   - **D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute it in a hidden manner.
     - This is not directly related to the storage of encrypted data blobs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the use of encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas is **T1027.011-Fileless Storage**.
   - However, since this specific sub-technique is not listed as an answer choice, we need to look for the closest match.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** is the closest match because it involves obfuscation, which is a form of evasion that can be used in conjunction with non-traditional file storage.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
