### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the netd component of Infamous Chisel automatically collected files from the local system and data directories, and also enumerated multiple data directories to collect GPS and hardware information.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after these collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the described action of collecting files from the local system and data directories.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automated collection of data, which also aligns with the described action of the netd component automatically collecting files and enumerating data directories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This technique involves identifying cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the collection of local system data or hardware information.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which is not directly related to the collection of local system data or hardware information.
   - **C: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL:** This technique involves modifying a network provider DLL to capture credentials, which is not directly related to the collection of local system data or hardware information.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. This aligns well with the described action of collecting GPS and hardware information, which is a form of system information discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible technique that occurred after the collection of local system data and hardware information is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
