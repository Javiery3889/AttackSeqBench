### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Deployment of the KerrDown downloader.
     - Decryption of the payload using the DES algorithm for in-memory execution.
     - Establishing communication for further payload transfer based on the victim's OS architecture.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the payload executable.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves the transfer of additional tools or payloads from an external source to the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection, which is not the primary focus of the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring additional tools or payloads to the compromised system, which aligns with the described action of establishing communication for further payload transfer.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking browser sessions, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves transferring additional tools or payloads to the compromised system, which is described by T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
