### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT10 conducted internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and later stages using open-source pentesting tools to map out the network.
   - The focus is on the next step in the attack sequence after the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials or other authentication material to gain access to systems. This is more likely to occur after the initial discovery phase to gain further access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery:** This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks and their configurations. This is more specific to wireless networks and less likely to be the next step after mapping out the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations, which aligns well with the described reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves manipulating multi-factor authentication to gain access. This is more likely to occur after the initial discovery phase to bypass security measures.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question states that APT10 conducted internal reconnaissance and mapped out the network. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to discover remote systems and their configurations to understand the network topology better.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** is the most plausible next step in this sequence.

### Final Answer: C: T1018-Remote System Discovery
