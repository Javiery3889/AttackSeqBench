### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gathered information from a compromised iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, and Wi-Fi status.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server using POST and GET requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data from a compromised system to a C2 server using various communication channels, including HTTP/HTTPS.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery:** This technique involves discovering available Wi-Fi networks, which can be used to understand the network environment and potentially exfiltrate data over Wi-Fi.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. It is not directly related to exfiltration or communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C2 server. It is a plausible choice because it aligns with the use of POST and GET requests to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves discovering software installed on a system. It is not directly related to exfiltration or communication with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1001.001-Junk Data:** This technique involves adding junk data to obfuscate the true nature of the data being exfiltrated. While it can be used in exfiltration, it is not the primary technique for communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **B: T1102-Web Service**. This technique directly involves using web services, which can include POST and GET requests, to communicate with a C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
