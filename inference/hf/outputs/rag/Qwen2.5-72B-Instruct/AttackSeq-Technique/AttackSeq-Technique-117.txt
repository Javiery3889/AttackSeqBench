### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Agrius:
     - Exploited public-facing applications.
     - Uploaded webshells for lateral movement.
     - Attempted defense evasion by obfuscating ASPXSpy webshells with a custom base64 encoding function.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between the upload of webshells and the obfuscation of the webshells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves the use of web shells to maintain persistent access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of files or commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:**
     - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography to protect the confidentiality of data. It is not directly related to the persistence or defense evasion described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1610-Deploy Container:**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the web shell or obfuscation described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. It is a plausible step that could occur after uploading webshells and before obfuscating them, as it helps in maintaining a foothold in the system.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying Unix shell configurations to maintain persistence. It is specific to Unix systems and may not be directly relevant to the web shell and obfuscation described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible technique that occurred between the upload of webshells and the obfuscation of the webshells is **T1543-Create or Modify System Process**. This technique helps in maintaining persistence, which is a logical step before attempting to evade defenses.

**Final Answer: C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
