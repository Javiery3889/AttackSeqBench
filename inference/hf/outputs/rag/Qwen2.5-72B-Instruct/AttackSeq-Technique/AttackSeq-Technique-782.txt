### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after ActionSpy used modules to gather data such as device location, contacts, call logs, and chat logs from messaging applications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves stealing chat messages, which aligns with the data gathering mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which also aligns with the data gathering mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the data gathering described.
   - **B: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to a system. This is more related to credential access and not directly to data gathering.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data. This aligns well with the use of modules to gather data.
   - **D: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails from a remote system. While this is a form of data collection, it is more specific to email and not the broader data types mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **C: T1119-Automated Collection**. This technique aligns with the use of modules to gather various types of data from the local system.

**Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection**
