### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware evades detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker using InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, and then executes its payload via proxy execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code.
   - **T1220-XSL Script Processing:** This technique involves using XSL scripts to execute code.
   - **T1218.004-InstallUtil:** This specific sub-technique involves using the InstallUtil utility to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. It is not directly related to the evasion and execution described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space:** This technique involves reducing the number of possible keys to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It is not relevant to the evasion and execution described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data. While it can be used for evasion, it is not the primary method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using trusted developer utilities, such as InstallUtil, to execute malicious code. This aligns perfectly with the description in the question, where InstallUtil is used to evade detection and execute the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**
