### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Initial access via exposed Weave Scope services.
     - Execution of a coin miner saved as `/usr/sbin/docker-update`.
     - Scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
     - Using iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access to a system. This aligns with the initial access via exposed Weave Scope services.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering network services, which aligns with scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves using the compromised system's resources for malicious purposes, such as running a coin miner. This aligns with the execution of the coin miner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is relevant to the scanning for open Docker API endpoints. However, it is not the most specific technique for the described actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging:**
     - This technique involves impairing command history logging, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which could be relevant to the execution of the coin miner. However, it does not specifically address the scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1007-System Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering system services, which is not as specific as network service discovery for the described actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. This technique aligns with the scanning for open Docker API endpoints, which is a key part of the described actions.

**Final Answer: A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most specific and relevant technique for the described actions is **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. Therefore, the correct answer should be:

**Final Answer: A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery** (This was a mistake in the initial evaluation. The correct answer is **B: T1046-Network Service Discovery**).
