### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the SLUB backdoor communicated with the attackers via Slack using hardcoded authentication tokens to post messages and command results to a private Slack channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves the adversary using chat messages to exfiltrate data or communicate with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves the adversary using a C2 channel that supports bidirectional communication, allowing the adversary to send commands and receive responses.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves the adversary using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the communication with the Slack channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1588.004-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves the use of digital certificates for various purposes, such as signing malware or establishing secure connections. This is not directly related to the communication with the Slack channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate command and control traffic. While this could be used to hide the communication, it is not the most likely technique to occur before the communication itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc.) to communicate with the C2 server. Given that the backdoor is using Slack, which is an application layer protocol, this is the most likely technique to occur before the communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor used an application layer protocol (T1071) to communicate with the Slack channel before posting messages and command results.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
