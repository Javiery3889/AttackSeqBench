### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Duke group uses Seaduke to retrieve system information and perform updates.
   - The communication with the C2 server is over HTTP/HTTPS, which implies a secure communication channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the technique is "T1071.001-Web Protocols."
   - T1071.001-Web Protocols refers to the use of web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication between the malware and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access. It is not related to secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS.
   - **B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for communication. It is not relevant to the use of HTTP/HTTPS.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect the confidentiality of data in transit. While HTTP/HTTPS can be encrypted, this technique is more general and does not specifically mention web protocols.
   - **D: T1505.002-Transport Agent**
     - This technique involves using transport agents to establish a backdoor. It is not related to secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique based on the related TTPs is T1071.001-Web Protocols, which specifically mentions the use of HTTP/HTTPS for communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols

**Correction:**
Upon re-evaluation, the correct answer should be:
Final Answer: T1071.001-Web Protocols

However, since the answer choices do not include T1071.001, the closest and most relevant choice is:
Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel

This is because HTTP/HTTPS typically involves encrypted communication, and T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant choice among the given options.
