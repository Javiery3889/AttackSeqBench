### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) has been collected from an iOS device.
   - The information is then sent out using Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data using standard algorithms like Base64 to obfuscate the data being exfiltrated.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This is a broader technique that includes various methods of encoding data to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1614-System Location Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the physical location of a system, which is not directly related to encoding and exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique is relevant because it involves encoding data to avoid detection, which aligns with the Base64 encoding described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**
     - This technique involves using a different domain to mask the true destination of network traffic, which is not directly related to encoding the data itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools, which is not related to encoding and exfiltrating data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is **T1132-Data Encoding**.

**Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding**
