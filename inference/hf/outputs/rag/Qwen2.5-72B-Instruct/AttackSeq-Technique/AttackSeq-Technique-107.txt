### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before DYMALLOY gained persistence through backdoors by utilizing remote document attachments.
   - The key points are:
     - Gaining persistence through backdoors.
     - Utilizing remote document attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614-System Location Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering the location of the system, which is not directly related to initial access or persistence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
     - This technique involves altering data to achieve specific objectives, which is not directly related to initial access or persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1505.004-IIS Components**
     - This technique involves targeting IIS components, which is not directly related to initial access or persistence through remote document attachments.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into web pages, which is not directly related to initial access or persistence through remote document attachments.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the use of remote document attachments to gain initial access before establishing persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that DYMALLOY used spearphishing with attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access before establishing persistence through backdoors.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
