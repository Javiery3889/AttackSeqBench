### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique used by CosmicDuke to gain entry into the system before establishing persistence through scheduled tasks and Windows services.
   - The focus is on the method of initial access, specifically through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a PDF file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
   - These TTPs all relate to the use of scheduled tasks for persistence and execution, which are mentioned in the question as steps taken after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. It is not directly related to gaining initial access through a PDF file vulnerability.
   - **B: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**
     - This technique involves manipulating the PATH environment variable to execute malicious code. It is not typically used for initial access through a PDF file vulnerability.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening malicious files or links, which can include PDF files with embedded exploits. This is a common method for initial access.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is the same as choice C, which is also a valid method for initial access through a PDF file vulnerability.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both C and D are the same and are the most plausible answer choices. Phishing is a common method for delivering malicious PDF files that exploit vulnerabilities to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
