### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where SideCopy used GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases and performed discovery to lure victims with decoy documents and cloned websites.
   - The focus is on the technique used to harvest access credentials from central Indian government employees.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001-Credentials (Reconnaissance):** This technique involves gathering credentials as part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection (Collection):** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link (Reconnaissance):** This technique involves using spearphishing links to lure victims.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, including credentials. However, the question does not mention the use of keyloggers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which aligns with the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1110.001-Password Guessing**
     - Password guessing involves attempting to guess passwords, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization, which is part of the reconnaissance phase but not specifically about harvesting credentials.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, which suggests that the credentials were harvested from a password store.
   - The related TTPs also support the idea of gathering credentials as part of the reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
