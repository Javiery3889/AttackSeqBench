### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Trojan.APT.Seinup uses Google Docs to evade callback detection and employs SSL for encrypted communications.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic, which can help in evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear legitimate, which can help in evading detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:**
     - This technique involves using one-way communication channels, which is not directly related to the described use of Google Docs and SSL for encrypted communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, which is not directly related to the described use of Google Docs and SSL.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication, which is not directly related to the described use of Google Docs and SSL.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear legitimate, which aligns with the goal of evading detection. Given that the malware is already using Google Docs and SSL to evade detection, it is plausible that it would also use masquerading to further blend in with legitimate processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using Google Docs and SSL for encrypted communications, the malware would use masquerading to further evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading**
