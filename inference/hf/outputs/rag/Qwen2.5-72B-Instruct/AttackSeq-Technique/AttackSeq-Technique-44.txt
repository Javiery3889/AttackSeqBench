### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the KONNI malware executed arbitrary code and before the stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server, which is the final step in the sequence.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is a step in the data collection process.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring additional tools to the infected host, which is not directly related to the sequence of capturing and exfiltrating screenshots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing data before exfiltration, but it is not a necessary step between executing arbitrary code and capturing screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique directly involves capturing screenshots, which is a logical step before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves checking user activity, which is not directly related to the sequence of capturing and exfiltrating screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up persistence, which is not directly related to the sequence of capturing and exfiltrating screenshots.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware executed arbitrary code, then captured screenshots, and finally exfiltrated the screenshots to the C2 infrastructure. Therefore, the technique that occurred after executing arbitrary code and before exfiltration is **T1113-Screen Capture**.

**Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture**
