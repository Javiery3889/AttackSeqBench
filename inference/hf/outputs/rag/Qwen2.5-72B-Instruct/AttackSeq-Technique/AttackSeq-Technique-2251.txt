### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where SideCopy used GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - The focus is on the credential harvesting phase, specifically targeting access credentials through tools like keyloggers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials:** This technique involves stealing cached domain credentials from a system.
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information like passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**
     - This technique involves creating and using Kerberos service tickets to authenticate to a service without needing the user's password. It is not directly related to keylogging or capturing user input.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1584.002-DNS Server**
     - This technique involves compromising a DNS server to redirect traffic. It is not related to credential harvesting or keylogging.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, such as credentials, through deceptive emails or websites. While it is a method of credential harvesting, it does not specifically involve keyloggers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information like passwords. This aligns directly with the use of keyloggers for credential harvesting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the focus on keyloggers for credential harvesting, the most plausible answer is **T1056-Input Capture**.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
