### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where VBA macros were used to write a 'network.js' file and modify the registry.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to ensure that NanHaiShu remained active across system reboots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a piece of malware is executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique aligns well with the goal of ensuring that NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots. Modifying the registry is a common method to achieve persistence, and it fits the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking Component Object Model (COM) objects, which is not directly related to ensuring persistence across reboots.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not related to persistence or ensuring the malware remains active.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which is not related to ensuring persistence across reboots.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
