### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Patchwork initiated Initial Access by exploiting CVE-2017-8750 through malicious RTF documents.
   - The focus is on the Reconnaissance phase, specifically identifying the technique used to identify targeted recipients who interacted with the spear phishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This sub-technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, such as RTF documents, to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**
     - This technique involves using scripting languages to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to the Reconnaissance phase or identifying targeted recipients.
   - **B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**
     - This technique involves searching public databases for information about the target. While it can be part of Reconnaissance, it is not specifically about identifying recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gather information from the target. It is closely related to the Reconnaissance phase and can be used to identify recipients who interacted with the spear phishing emails.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code. It is more related to the Initial Access phase rather than the Reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using phishing to gather information about the recipients who interacted with the spear phishing emails.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
