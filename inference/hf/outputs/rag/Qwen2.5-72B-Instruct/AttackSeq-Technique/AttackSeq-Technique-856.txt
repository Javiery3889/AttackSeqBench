### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after network scanning (T1046) and before establishing persistence for the Conpee plugin framework without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.
   - The Conpee plugin framework is a persistence mechanism, but it does not use the Windows Registry or startup items, which suggests it might use a different method for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique is used to identify network services and is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is used to establish persistence by modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category of persistence techniques that includes various methods to execute code at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access to a system. It is not directly related to the sequence of network scanning and persistence.
   - **B: T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs:** This technique involves clearing system logs on Linux or Mac systems, which is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using network traffic to signal or communicate with other systems. It is not directly related to the sequence of network scanning and persistence.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using valid cloud accounts to gain access to cloud resources. It is not directly related to the sequence of network scanning and persistence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves a technique that could logically occur between network scanning and establishing persistence without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.
   - Given the context, the most likely technique is one that involves maintaining access to the system in a way that does not rely on the Windows Registry or startup items. This could be through external remote services (T1133).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1133-External Remote Services
