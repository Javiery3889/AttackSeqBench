### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and establishes legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - The focus is on the technique used to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point and establish contact with the C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy**
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker is using proxy tools to facilitate command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
     - This technique is related to reducing the key space in cryptographic attacks, which is not relevant to the scenario of compiling binary files and establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not directly related to compiling binary files or establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, which can be used to transmit data (including binary files) over a network. This is relevant to the scenario of compiling binary files from decoded snippets and establishing C2 communication.
   - **D: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
     - This technique involves modifying the authentication process, which is not relevant to the scenario of compiling binary files or establishing C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: T1132-Data Encoding**. This technique aligns with the scenario of compiling binary files from decoded snippets and establishing contact with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
