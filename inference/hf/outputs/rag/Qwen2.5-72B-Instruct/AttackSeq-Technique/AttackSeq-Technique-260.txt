### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access phase and specifically mentions the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection.
   - The focus is on the technique used to compromise external remote services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1133-External Remote Services."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**
     - This technique involves a method of process injection and is typically used for persistence and privilege escalation, not for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access, which could be relevant to initial access but is not specifically about compromising external remote services.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
     - This technique involves loading code into memory without touching the disk and is more relevant to execution and defense evasion, not initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access to a network. It aligns perfectly with the context of the question, which mentions compromising external remote services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly involves compromising external remote services, which is T1133-External Remote Services.

**Final Answer: D: T1133-External Remote Services**
