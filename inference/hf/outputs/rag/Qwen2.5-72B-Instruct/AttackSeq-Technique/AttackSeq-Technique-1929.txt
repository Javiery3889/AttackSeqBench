### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an installer places spyware components and launches `sysCrt32.exe` along with the VPN software.
   - The key part of the question is to determine how the malware ensures that `sysBus32.exe` runs every 3 hours.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the system's search order to execute a malicious file instead of a legitimate one.
   - **T1053.002-At:** This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command, which is a legacy method for scheduling tasks.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to ensure that a malicious process runs at specific intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique is directly related to scheduling tasks to ensure that a process runs at specific intervals. The question mentions that `sysBus32.exe` needs to run every 3 hours, which aligns with the use of a scheduled task.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is not relevant to ensuring a process runs at specific intervals.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
     - This technique involves using local accounts for persistence, which is not directly related to scheduling tasks.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is not relevant to scheduling tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**. This technique aligns with the requirement to ensure that `sysBus32.exe` runs every 3 hours.

**Final Answer: A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
