### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker uses defense evasion methods such as redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services. The next step in the attack sequence involves accessing credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials by impersonating a web portal, which aligns with the description of phishing pages impersonating login portals.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating a user or system to evade detection, which is relevant to the initial steps of redirecting victims and using domain shortening services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which is not directly related to phishing or web portal impersonation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, which is more related to network manipulation and not directly to credential capture through phishing.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing or acquiring capabilities to support operations, which is a broader and less specific technique and does not directly relate to credential capture.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which includes web portal capture (T1056.003). This is the most relevant to the described scenario of accessing credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1056-Input Capture**.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
