### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has established persistence by modifying registry values and replacing a system file (sens.dll) to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to hide the files, registry keys, and processes of the malware PurpleFox.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to change system behavior, such as creating or modifying registry keys to achieve persistence.
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise, such as logs or alerts, to prevent detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence on a host to impede analysis and detection. While this could be relevant, it is more about removing evidence rather than hiding artifacts.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, or processes to avoid detection. This aligns well with the question's requirement to hide the files, registry keys, and processes of the malware.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using legitimate command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts. This is not directly related to hiding artifacts.
   - **D: T1036.009-Break Process Trees:** This technique involves breaking the logical process tree to hide the relationship between processes. While this can help in evasion, it is more specific to process relationships rather than hiding files and registry keys.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves hiding the files, registry keys, and processes of the malware to avoid detection. The technique that best fits this description is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
