### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after APT42 used application layer protocols and encrypted channels to maintain communication with compromised systems.
   - The key points are:
     - APT42 used application layer protocols (T1071).
     - APT42 used encrypted channels (T1573).
     - We need to determine what technique likely followed these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses to avoid detection. It is not directly related to maintaining communication after using application layer protocols and encrypted channels.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 infrastructure. This could be a logical next step after establishing encrypted communication, as it provides a way to maintain and manage the C2 infrastructure.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing or acquiring new tools and capabilities. While this is a common post-compromise activity, it is not directly related to maintaining communication.
   - **D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature:** This technique involves using invalid code signatures to bypass security mechanisms. It is not directly related to maintaining communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after APT42 establishes communication using application layer protocols and encrypted channels, they would likely use a web service to host and manage their C2 infrastructure. This aligns with the goal of maintaining persistent and reliable communication with the compromised systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
