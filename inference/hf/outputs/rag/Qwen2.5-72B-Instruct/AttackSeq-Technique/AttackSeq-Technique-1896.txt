### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13, specifically focusing on what happens after they use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - The key points are:
     - Lateral movement using Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR.
     - Staging data from network shared drives locally or remotely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:**
     - This technique involves using WMI to execute commands on remote systems, which is consistent with the use of Invoke-WMIExec.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting email data from local email clients. It is not directly related to the transfer or staging of data from network shared drives.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate. This is a logical step after data has been staged from network shared drives.
   - **C: T1586.002-Email Accounts:**
     - This technique involves compromising email accounts, which is not directly related to the transfer or staging of data from network shared drives.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection during exfiltration. While it is a plausible step, it is typically used after data has been collected and staged.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. Lateral movement using Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR (T1570 and T1047).
     2. Staging data from network shared drives locally or remotely.
     3. Archiving the collected data to prepare for exfiltration (T1560).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data
