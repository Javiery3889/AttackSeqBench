### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater initially gains access through spear-phishing attacks targeting sectors in the Middle East.
   - The focus is on the technique used to process requests between the clients and the C2 server to support payload delivery and information collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or download and execute malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves concealing the infrastructure used in the attack, such as using domain fronting or other methods to mask the true C2 server. While this is a valid technique, it is not directly related to processing requests between clients and the C2 server for payload delivery and information collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad category that includes spear-phishing, but the question is asking about the technique used after initial access has been gained.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with the C2 server. This is a plausible choice because it directly relates to processing requests between the client and the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584.006-Web Services:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with the C2 server. While this is also a valid technique, it is more specific to using web services, which may not be the most common method for MuddyWater.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique for processing requests between the clients and the C2 server to support payload delivery and information collection is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
