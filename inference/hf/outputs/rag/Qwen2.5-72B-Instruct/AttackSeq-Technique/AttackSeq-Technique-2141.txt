### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has made a POST request to a C2 domain (judystevenson[.]info).
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves adversaries transferring tools or other files from a remote system to the victim network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP) for C2 communication. However, the question specifically mentions a POST request, which is a web protocol, not a mail protocol.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication:** This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to maintain access. It is not related to the transfer of tools or payloads.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from a remote system to the victim network. This aligns with the scenario where additional tools or payloads are transferred to communicate with multiple C2 domains.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking victims into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. It is not related to the transfer of tools or payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
