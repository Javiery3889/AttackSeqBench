### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a custom tunneling tool was used for data exfiltration.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy within the network to route traffic.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network controls.
   - **T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves creating a bridge between network segments to facilitate communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070.006-Timestomp**
     - Timestomp is a technique used to manipulate file timestamps to evade detection. It does not relate to network communication or data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. The specific sub-technique T1090.001-Internal Proxy is listed in the related TTPs, which aligns with the scenario of using a compromised router to enable communication between network segments.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration. While it is useful for reconnaissance, it does not directly enable communication between network segments.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using non-standard protocols to communicate. While it can be used for data exfiltration, it does not specifically address the use of a compromised router to bridge network segments.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is **T1090-Proxy**. The use of a compromised router to enable communication between network segments aligns with the internal proxy technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
