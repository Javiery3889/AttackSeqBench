### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses DLL side-loading to decode and launch shellcode from a document named "mic.doc".
   - After this, the attacker establishes communication with a C&C server via "app.onedrivo.com".

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, which is a technique used to execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.
   - This technique is part of the Defense Evasion tactic, which aims to avoid detection and analysis by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves the use of remote access tools (RATs) to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system.
     - While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly describe the communication with a C&C server via a web service.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules to execute code.
     - This is related to the initial DLL side-loading but does not describe the communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with a C&C server.
     - The use of "app.onedrivo.com" suggests that the attacker is leveraging a legitimate web service to mask their C&C communication.
   - **D: T1557.004-Evil Twin**
     - This technique involves creating a fake wireless access point to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
     - This is not relevant to the described scenario of communicating with a C&C server via a web service.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is C: T1102-Web Service. This technique aligns with the described communication with the C&C server via "app.onedrivo.com".

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
