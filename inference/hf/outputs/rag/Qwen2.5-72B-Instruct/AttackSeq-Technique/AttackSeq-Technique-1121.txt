### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after LYCEUM gained additional access from credentials gathered via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 and before targeting HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to acquire information for further operational planning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves using internal spearphishing to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for reconnaissance purposes.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access to a target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves discovering system and network account information. This could be a logical step after gaining initial access and before further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain additional credentials. This could be a logical step after gaining initial access and before further actions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves gaining additional access from credentials and then targeting HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails. The most logical step between these two actions would be to discover and gather more account information to facilitate the spearphishing campaign.
   - **T1087-Account Discovery** fits this sequence well because it involves discovering system and network account information, which would be useful for planning and executing a spearphishing campaign.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1087-Account Discovery
