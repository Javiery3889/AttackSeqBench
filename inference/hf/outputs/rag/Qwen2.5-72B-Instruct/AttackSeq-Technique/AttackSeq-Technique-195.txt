### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the use of SparrowDoor to read file contents for data collection and then exfiltrating data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel.
   - The focus is on the communication with the C&C server before the exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is Exfiltration, and the specific technique is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - This suggests that the communication with the C&C server is a crucial step in the exfiltration process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection**
     - Process injection is a technique used to execute arbitrary code in the address space of a separate process. This is typically used for persistence or to evade detection, but it does not directly relate to communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
     - This technique involves determining the physical location of the target, which is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server or the exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to protect the confidentiality of the data being exfiltrated. While this is a plausible technique, it is not the primary focus of the question, which is more about the communication itself.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol, often to bypass network security measures. This is a common method for communicating with a C&C server and is directly relevant to the exfiltration process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique that occurred when SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server is **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**.

**Final Answer: D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
