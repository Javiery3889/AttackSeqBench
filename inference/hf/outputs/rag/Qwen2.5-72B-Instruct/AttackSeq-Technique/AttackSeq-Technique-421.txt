### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely involved in gathering information about vulnerabilities in the target during the Reconnaissance phase, before the adversaries exploited vulnerabilities in Citrix systems and used password spraying techniques for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.003-Password Spraying:** This technique involves using a list of common passwords to attempt to log in to user accounts.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in the target's systems and applications to identify potential entry points.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves hiding the true nature of files or information to evade detection. It is not related to the Reconnaissance phase or gathering information about vulnerabilities.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves actively probing the target's systems to gather information. The sub-technique T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning is specifically mentioned in the related TTPs, making this a strong candidate.
   - **C: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials, which is more related to the Credential Access phase rather than the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **D: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection:** This technique involves modifying the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to the Reconnaissance phase or gathering information about vulnerabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning to gather information about vulnerabilities in the target before exploiting them and using password spraying techniques for initial access.

**Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning**
