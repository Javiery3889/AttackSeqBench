### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique used to conceal the identity of the C2 (Command and Control) server during communication after exploiting known vulnerabilities through malicious documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or services to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard data encoding formats to obfuscate command and control traffic. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly conceal the identity of the C2 server.
   - **B: T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It is not typically used to conceal the identity of the C2 server.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into opening malicious documents or links. It is used for initial access, not for concealing the C2 server.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves routing network traffic through an intermediary to conceal the true source or destination of the traffic. This is a common method to hide the identity of the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique to conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication is **T1090-Proxy**.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
