### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Shuckworm group:
     - They used malicious documents to execute the Pterodo backdoor.
     - They used scheduled tasks to support their foothold.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique ensured the backdoor remained active across system reboots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs to execute commands or scripts at specific times.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute commands or scripts at specific times, ensuring that the backdoor remains active across system reboots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up programs to run automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common method for ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1098-Account Manipulation:**
     - This technique involves manipulating user or service accounts to maintain access. It is not directly related to ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1204.003-Malicious Image:**
     - This technique involves using malicious images to trick users into executing code. It is not related to persistence across reboots.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. It is not directly related to ensuring persistence across reboots.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for ensuring the backdoor remains active across system reboots is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**. This technique aligns with the use of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence, as described in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
