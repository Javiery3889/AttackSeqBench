### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has collected information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. The next step in the attack sequence is to communicate with remote servers to exfiltrate the collected data and receive updates for the malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves exfiltrating data from removable media, which is not relevant to the scenario of communicating with remote servers.
   - **B: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves manipulating multi-factor authentication, which is not related to exfiltration or communication with remote servers.
   - **C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting:** This technique involves using domain fronting to mask the true destination of network traffic, which can be used for exfiltration but is not the most direct method for the described scenario.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with remote servers, which is a common method for exfiltrating data and receiving updates.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using a standard application layer protocol to communicate with remote servers for exfiltration and updates. This aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which often uses application layer protocols.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
