### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by KiraV2, starting with telnet dictionary attacks to compromise IoT devices using weak credentials.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before employing anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain a long-term infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to perform actions that may not be detected as malicious.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves scheduling actions to occur at specific times to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking Component Object Model (COM) objects to execute malicious code. This is more related to persistence and execution rather than initial access or defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1653-Power Settings:** This technique involves modifying power settings to keep a system awake or to wake it up at specific times. This is more related to maintaining access and avoiding detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:** This technique involves compromising third-party infrastructure to gain access to a target. This is more related to initial access but not specifically to the context of telnet dictionary attacks.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1110-Brute Force:** This technique involves using brute force attacks to guess passwords and gain access to accounts. This aligns well with the telnet dictionary attacks described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that KiraV2 first used brute force attacks (T1110) to compromise IoT devices with weak credentials, and then employed anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain a long-term infection.

**Final Answer: D: T1110-Brute Force**
