### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already moved laterally across the infrastructure and have compromised numerous workstations and internal hosts.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves the attackers searching for critical information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement. This is already part of the attack sequence described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the attackers searching for critical information after compromising the workstations and internal hosts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to the collection of critical information.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is a more specific form of data collection. This could be a plausible next step after compromising the workstations and servers.
   - **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system. While this is a common technique used during the initial stages of an attack, it is less likely to be the next step after lateral movement and compromising multiple systems.
   - **D: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing:** This technique involves spoofing DHCP responses to control network configurations. This is not directly related to the collection of critical information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible next step after the attackers have moved laterally and compromised multiple systems is to collect critical information. The technique that best aligns with this is **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
