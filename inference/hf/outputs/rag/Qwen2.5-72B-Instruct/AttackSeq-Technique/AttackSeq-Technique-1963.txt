### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to maintain persistence in the environment before exporting saved passwords from Chrome and using renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves renaming malicious files to match the names or locations of legitimate system files to avoid detection.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This is a broader technique that includes various methods to make malicious files or processes appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1205.002-Socket Filters:** This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence or masquerading.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to gain access to a system. While it can be used for persistence, it is not specifically about maintaining persistence in the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating new accounts on the system to maintain persistence. This is a plausible technique for maintaining persistence before performing other actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL:** This technique involves using a Netsh helper DLL to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used for persistence, it is more specific to executing code rather than creating a new account.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for maintaining persistence in the environment before exporting saved passwords and using renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries is **T1136-Create Account**. Creating a new account can provide a persistent foothold in the system, which is a common step in the attack sequence before performing other actions like exporting passwords and masquerading.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1136-Create Account
