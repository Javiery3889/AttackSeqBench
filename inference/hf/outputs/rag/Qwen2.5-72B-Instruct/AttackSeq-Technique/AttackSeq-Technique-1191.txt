### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the RMS (Rights Management Services) tool is used to evade detection through legitimate application functions.
   - After evading detection, the RMS executable establishes communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server located in Germany.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system or application files to avoid detection.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:** This technique involves using fast-flux DNS to hide the location of C2 servers, which is not directly related to the communication method used.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server, which is relevant to the communication aspect.
   - **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique is a sub-technique of T1071 and specifically involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication, which is also relevant.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question specifically mentions that the RMS executable established communication with a C2 server. This communication is likely to use standard application layer protocols, which are common for C2 communication.
   - Both C and D are relevant, but D (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is more specific and likely to be the method used for C2 communication over the web.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1071.001-Web Protocols
