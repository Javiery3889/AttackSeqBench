### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after FIN13 used lateral movement methods (WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE) to access additional systems within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistent access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:** This technique involves using WMI to execute commands on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate or logical next step after lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1123-Audio Capture:** This technique involves capturing audio from a system. This is a very specific and less common technique and is not typically a direct follow-up to lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. After gaining access to additional systems, exfiltrating data is a logical next step, especially if the attacker has already established a web shell.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. While this is a plausible next step, it is less immediate than exfiltration, especially if the attacker has already established a web shell.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible next step after lateral movement and establishing a web shell would be to exfiltrate data over a web service.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
