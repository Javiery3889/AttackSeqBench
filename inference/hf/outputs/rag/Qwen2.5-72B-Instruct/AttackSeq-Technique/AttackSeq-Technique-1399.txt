### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where TidePool establishes persistence using an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to initially gain access to victim machines through weaponized documents exploiting CVE-2015-2545.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.014-Active Setup**: This technique is used for persistence by creating or modifying the Active Setup registry key to execute arbitrary code when a user logs in.
   - **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.
   - **T1547.014-Active Setup** (repeated for emphasis on persistence).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending malicious emails or messages to trick users into opening weaponized documents or clicking on malicious links. This aligns well with the initial access through weaponized documents.
   - **T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery**: This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks, which is not relevant to gaining initial access through weaponized documents.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate, which is not relevant to the initial access method described.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access, which is not relevant to the initial access through weaponized documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was gained through phishing, where the attacker sent weaponized documents exploiting CVE-2015-2545 to the victims.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
