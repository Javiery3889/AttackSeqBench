### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before TA505 utilized Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on systems running the vulnerable Serv-U software.
   - The key points are:
     - Base64 encoded PowerShell commands
     - Deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon
     - Systems running the vulnerable Serv-U software

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating or encoding command and script content to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
     - Given that the systems are running the vulnerable Serv-U software, this is a plausible initial step before deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets:**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources.
     - This is more likely to occur after gaining initial access and is not directly related to the initial deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code.
     - This is a method for persistence and execution, but it is not the initial step before deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078.001-Default Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems.
     - While this could be a method for initial access, it is less likely given the specific mention of the vulnerable Serv-U software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the vulnerable Serv-U software and the need to gain initial access before deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon, the most plausible answer is:
     - **Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
