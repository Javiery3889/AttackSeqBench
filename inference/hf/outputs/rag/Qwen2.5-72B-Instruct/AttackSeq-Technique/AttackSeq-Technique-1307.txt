### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious document is delivered via LinkedIn messages for job solicitation.
   - The goal is to determine the technique that facilitated the execution of the backdoor TONEDEAF before achieving persistence through a scheduled task running 'System Manager.exe'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactics involved are **Persistence** and **Execution**.
   - The specific techniques mentioned are:
     - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique is used for both persistence and execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique is used for both persistence and execution. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that facilitated the execution of the backdoor TONEDEAF before achieving persistence.
     - While this is a relevant technique, it is more aligned with the persistence phase rather than the execution phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
     - This technique involves communication between processes, which is not directly related to the execution of a backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute code. This is a common method for executing a backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication**
     - This technique involves authenticating to network devices, which is not relevant to the execution of a backdoor on a victim's system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that facilitated the execution of the backdoor TONEDEAF is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
