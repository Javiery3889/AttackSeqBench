### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a VBScript is used to create an object in the shell and execute a PowerShell command running base64 encoded infection code.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after this sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.011-Lua:** This technique involves the use of Lua scripting, which is not mentioned in the question or related TTPs.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This is a broad category that includes the use of various scripting languages, including PowerShell. However, it is not specific enough to the context of the question.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which aligns with the base64 encoded infection code mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1542.004-ROMMONkit:** This technique involves modifying firmware, which is not relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the use of a VBScript to execute a PowerShell command with base64 encoded infection code.
   - The related TTPs confirm the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and command obfuscation (T1027.010).
   - The most plausible technique that occurred after the execution of the PowerShell command is the obfuscation of the infection code to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
