### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where TG-3279 reused network infrastructure by sharing IPs among domain names.
   - It also mentions that TG-3279 gained initial access using tools 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS:** This technique involves monitoring DNS requests to gather information. While it can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:** This technique involves acquiring infrastructure such as servers, domains, and IP addresses. This could be relevant to the reuse of network infrastructure, but it does not directly lead to initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks to identify potential targets. Given that TG-3279 used tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets:** This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain access. While it is a credential access technique, it is not directly related to the initial scanning and exploitation described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that TG-3279 performed active scanning before gaining initial access using the tools 's' and 'rdp_crk'.

**Final Answer: C: T1595-Active Scanning**
