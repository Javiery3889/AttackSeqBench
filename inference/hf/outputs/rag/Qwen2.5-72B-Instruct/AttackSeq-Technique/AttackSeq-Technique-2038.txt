### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - It gathers network information using the `GetAdaptersInfo()` function API.
   - It then attempts to evade defenses by detecting runtime checksum changes and debugger presence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by checking for the presence of debuggers.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique is listed again, emphasizing the importance of debugger evasion in the context of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique directly aligns with the question's description of the malware attempting to evade defenses by detecting runtime checksum changes and debugger presence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type:** This technique involves disguising files to appear as legitimate, which is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up persistence at boot or logon, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1597.001-Threat Intel Vendors:** This technique involves targeting threat intelligence vendors, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that the malware first gathers network information and then attempts to evade defenses by detecting runtime checksum changes and debugger presence.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the evasion is **T1622-Debugger Evasion**.

Final Answer: **A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
