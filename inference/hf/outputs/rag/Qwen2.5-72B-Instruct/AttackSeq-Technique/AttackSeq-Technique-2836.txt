### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN1 used the Nemesis bootkit to bypass operating system integrity checks through a custom virtual file system (VFS). The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique enabled FIN1 to ensure persistence on the victim systems, even after an operating system reinstallation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique involves using a bootkit to gain control of the system before the operating system loads, which can be used to ensure persistence.
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attack, which is more about defense evasion rather than persistence.
   - **T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves creating a hidden file system to hide malicious files, which is also more about defense evasion rather than persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access:** This technique involves temporarily elevating access in cloud environments, which is not relevant to ensuring persistence on a local system.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1592.001-Hardware:** This technique involves hardware-based persistence, which is not mentioned in the context of the Nemesis bootkit.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking threads to execute malicious code, which is more about execution rather than persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot:** This technique involves modifying the boot process to ensure that malicious code runs before the operating system loads, which aligns with the use of a bootkit to ensure persistence even after an operating system reinstallation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the Nemesis bootkit and the goal of ensuring persistence, is **T1542-Pre-OS Boot**.

**Final Answer: D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
