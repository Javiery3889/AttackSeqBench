### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malware is implanted through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - After the implantation, Longhorn (presumably the malware or the attacker) uses secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attack.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts, which is not related to the secure erase protocols or file deletion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing, which is not related to the secure erase protocols or file deletion.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves phishing, which is related to the initial infection vector (the Word document), but not to the secure erase protocols or file deletion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1070-Indicator Removal**.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
