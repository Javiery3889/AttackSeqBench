### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary cleaned up traces of their intrusions (clearing Windows event logs) and before they used PsLogList for discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**
   - These TTPs indicate that the adversary is trying to remove indicators of their presence, specifically by clearing Windows event logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access**
     - This technique involves temporarily elevating access in cloud environments, which is not directly related to the sequence of cleaning up traces and using PsLogList for discovery.
   - **B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**
     - This technique involves impersonating or stealing tokens to gain higher privileges, which is more related to initial access or privilege escalation, not the cleanup or discovery phases.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to other systems, which is more related to the initial stages of an attack, not the cleanup or discovery phases.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which aligns with the cleaning up traces phase. The specific sub-technique T1070.001 (Clear Windows Event Logs) is already mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves cleaning up traces (T1070.001) and then using PsLogList for discovery. The technique that fits between these two actions is T1070-Indicator Removal, as it is a broader category that includes T1070.001 and other methods of removing indicators.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
