### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after LightNeuron discovered network configurations using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` but before it used emails as a channel for exfiltrating collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering network configuration details, which aligns with the use of `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves adversaries exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with using emails for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up programs to automatically execute at boot or logon. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the sequence of discovery and exfiltration.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique is mentioned in the related TTPs and is the final step in the sequence described in the question. It cannot be the technique that occurred between discovery and exfiltration.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves adversaries using automated methods to collect data from the system. This fits well between the discovery of network configurations and the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - This technique is not relevant to the context of the question and does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that LightNeuron performed automated collection (T1119) after discovering network configurations and before exfiltrating the data.

**Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection**
