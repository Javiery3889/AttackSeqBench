### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial distribution method used by attackers to gain access to victims before they evaded suspicion by disguising North Korean fundraising apps as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1647-Plist File Modification:** This technique involves modifying property list (plist) files to change the behavior of applications or to hide malicious activities.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or programs to appear legitimate or benign.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. This is less likely to be the initial distribution method for a malicious app, especially one that is disguised as a fundraising app.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking victims into clicking on malicious links or downloading malicious files through social engineering. This is a common method for distributing malicious apps and aligns well with the scenario of disguising the app as something legitimate.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection, which is more relevant to the post-compromise phase of the attack rather than the initial distribution.
   - **T1037.004-RC Scripts:** This technique involves modifying or creating RC scripts to execute malicious code, which is also more relevant to the post-compromise phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible initial distribution method for the malicious app, given the context of disguising it as a legitimate fundraising app, is **Phishing (T1566)**. Phishing is a common and effective method for tricking users into downloading and installing malicious applications.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
