### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the exploitation of Internet Explorer users through specific CVEs (CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411) during a strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the exploitation and before leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like a web browser) to execute code on the victim's system.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code. It is not typically used immediately after gaining initial access through a web exploit.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is already part of the initial access phase, which is described as leveraging the CVEs in Internet Explorer. It is not a subsequent step.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It is a plausible step to take after gaining initial access and before setting up command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves stealing the NTDS.dit file to extract password hashes. It is typically used for credential access and is not a step that would occur immediately after gaining initial access and before setting up command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred after the exploitation of the CVEs and before leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique helps the attacker avoid detection while setting up further operations.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
