### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that enabled the Darkhotel APT group to conduct large-scale cryptographic operations and utilize Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for leveraging their infrastructure after conducting reconnaissance to identify their targets' whereabouts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for use in subsequent stages of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves acquiring email accounts to use in the attack.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves using dynamic DNS to maintain command and control (C2) infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure (e.g., servers, domains, IP addresses) to support the attack. This aligns well with the use of Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for leveraging their infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1584.008-Network Devices:**
     - This technique involves compromising network devices to gain access to the network. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly align with the large-scale cryptographic operations and the use of web infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing user input (e.g., keystrokes, credentials). While this could be used for reconnaissance, it does not align with the infrastructure setup described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1608.006-SEO Poisoning:**
     - This technique involves manipulating search engine results to direct users to malicious sites. This is more about influencing user behavior and does not align with the infrastructure setup described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**. This technique directly supports the acquisition and setup of the necessary infrastructure (Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps) for the attack.

**Final Answer: A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
