### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the threat actor Earth Empusa used malicious scripts on a phishing page disguised as a download page to target individuals in Tibet.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after the initial use of the malicious scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.005-Link Target:** This technique involves establishing and maintaining access to a target by creating or using a link to the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with a link to a malicious website or file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim, such as names, email addresses, and other personal details. This could be relevant if the threat actor is looking to gather more information about the victim after the initial access.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the victim's system. This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access, as the threat actor might want to automate the collection of data.
   - **C: T1546.005-Trap:** This technique involves setting up a trap to detect or prevent the removal of malware. This is less likely to be the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:** This technique involves searching public databases for information about the target. This is more relevant to the reconnaissance phase, which typically occurs before initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the threat actor has already used a phishing page to gain initial access, the most logical next step would be to gather more information about the victim or to automate the collection of data from the compromised system.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection** is the most plausible next step because it aligns with the goal of efficiently collecting data from the victim's system after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1119-Automated Collection
