### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before ZoxPNG established initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests by sending a PNG file containing instructions or data.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial contact with the C2 server.
     - HTTP GET requests.
     - PNG file containing instructions or data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:**
     - This technique involves checking for an active internet connection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other files, such as images (PNG files).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This is a broad category that includes web protocols like HTTP. However, it is not specific enough to describe the use of steganography in PNG files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:**
     - This technique involves using fast-flux DNS to hide the location of C2 servers. It is not directly related to the initial contact using HTTP GET requests with a PNG file.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing:**
     - This technique involves automated injection of credential pairs into web applications. It is not related to the initial contact with a C2 server using HTTP GET requests with a PNG file.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. It is not directly related to the initial contact with a C2 server using HTTP GET requests with a PNG file.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique is **T1001.002-Steganography** because it specifically involves hiding data within files, such as PNG files, which aligns with the description of the initial contact using HTTP GET requests with a PNG file containing instructions or data.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API

**Correction:**
Upon re-evaluation, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: T1001.002-Steganography

However, since T1001.002 is not one of the provided answer choices, the closest and most relevant answer choice is:

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

This choice is the most appropriate because it encompasses the use of web protocols (HTTP) for C2 communication, which is a key part of the described attack sequence.
