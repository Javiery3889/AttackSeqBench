### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the SBDH malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Utilizing powerful filters for specifying exfiltration data based on attributes like file extension, creation date, and file size.
     - Relying on multiple communication methods, including HTTP and SMTP, for Command and Control (C2).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp:**
     - This technique involves modifying file timestamps to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows kernel callback table to achieve persistence or privilege escalation. It is not directly related to exfiltration or C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not specifically related to the exfiltration or C2 communication described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information. It is not directly related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves automating the collection of data from the victim's system. This fits well with the step of utilizing powerful filters for specifying exfiltration data based on attributes like file extension, creation date, and file size.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the SBDH malware first automated the collection of data (T1119-Automated Collection) before exfiltrating it over C2 channels (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

**Final Answer: D: T1119-Automated Collection**
