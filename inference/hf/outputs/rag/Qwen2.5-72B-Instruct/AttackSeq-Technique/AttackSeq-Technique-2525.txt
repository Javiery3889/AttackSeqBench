### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before BlueDelta exploited Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities to gather system information, network configuration, owner/user details, and network connections.
   - The exploitation of Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities is described as T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about installed software on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing:** This technique involves using a list of known username and password pairs to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This is typically used for initial access but is not directly related to gathering system information.
   - **B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's host, which is similar to system information discovery but is more general.
   - **C: T1614.001-System Language Discovery:** This technique involves determining the language settings of the system, which is a very specific type of information and not typically a primary step before exploitation.
   - **D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, which is directly related to the information BlueDelta is gathering (system information, network configuration, owner/user details, and network connections).

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that before exploiting the Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities, the attacker would need to gather information about the system and its network configuration to understand the environment and plan the attack.
   - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery aligns best with the information gathering described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
