### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by Grandoreiro to collect information about the username and other system details after evading detection.
   - The evasion techniques mentioned include hooking APIs to prevent loading DLLs of banking protection software and checking for debugging tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique is used to evade detection by checking for debugging tools.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique is used to collect information about the system owner and user.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network connections, which is not directly related to collecting information about the username and system details.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.012-COR_PROFILER:** This technique involves using the COR_PROFILER environment variable to inject code into .NET applications, which is not related to collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique is specifically about collecting information about the system owner and user, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into processes, which is not directly related to collecting system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is the technique that directly involves collecting information about the system owner and user.

**Final Answer: C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
