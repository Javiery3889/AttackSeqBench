### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after Elfin used PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging (defense evasion) and before deploying DarkComet to extract credentials (credential access).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open ports. It is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gather information, not in the middle of an attack sequence.
   - **B: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging:** This technique involves creating a new process by injecting code into a legitimate process. It is a sophisticated method of process injection and can be used for defense evasion, but it is not directly related to bypassing logging or preparing for credential extraction.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and services to prevent detection and response. This aligns well with the context of bypassing logging and preparing the environment for further actions.
   - **D: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions to modify or control services. While it can be used for persistence and defense evasion, it is not as directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of bypassing logging and preparing the environment for credential extraction, the most plausible technique is **T1562-Impair Defenses**.

**Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
