### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where APT10 uses decryption and injection mechanisms to evade security products while loading the PlugX payload by modifying executable header magic values.
   - The key points are:
     - Decryption and injection mechanisms.
     - Evasion of security products.
     - Loading the PlugX payload.
     - Modifying executable header magic values.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1480.001-Environmental Keying:** This technique involves using environmental factors to determine whether to execute or not, which is a form of evasion.
   - **T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to evade detection.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files to make them usable, often used to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This is a broad category that includes various injection techniques. The specific sub-technique T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection is listed in the related TTPs, which aligns with the injection mechanism described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1622-Debugger Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading debuggers, which is not directly related to the injection and decryption mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the injection and decryption mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion:**
     - This technique involves using mutual exclusion to prevent multiple instances of malware from running, which is not directly related to the injection and decryption mechanisms described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1055-Process Injection**. Specifically, the sub-technique T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection aligns with the injection mechanism used to evade security products and load the PlugX payload.

**Final Answer: A: T1055-Process Injection**
