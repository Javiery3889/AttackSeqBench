### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used by Korplug after the custom loader decrypted and executed the encrypted payload in memory, but before it established persistence using a scheduled task or a Run registry entry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the payload executable.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves creating or modifying registry run keys or startup folder entries to ensure the malware runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access to a system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the initial execution and persistence setup.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after the payload is executed in memory.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be a step towards establishing persistence. However, the question specifically mentions the use of a scheduled task or a Run registry entry, which is more directly related to T1547.001.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information, which is often a step taken by malware to understand the environment it is running in before taking further actions. This is a plausible step after the payload is executed in memory and before setting up persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique used after the custom loader decrypted and executed the encrypted payload in memory is **T1082-System Information Discovery**. This step would help the malware gather necessary information about the system before setting up persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
