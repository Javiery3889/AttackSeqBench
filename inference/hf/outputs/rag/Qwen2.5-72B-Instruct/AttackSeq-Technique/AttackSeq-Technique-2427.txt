### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers have already compromised the bank's network and escalated their privileges.
   - The next step involves using captured credentials to connect to the processor's network for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is used for initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems, which can be used for both initial access and privilege escalation.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts (Privilege Escalation):** This indicates that the attackers have already used valid accounts to escalate their privileges within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1205.002-Socket Filters:** This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to using captured credentials for network access.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services (like RDP, SSH, etc.) to connect to systems. This is a plausible step after capturing credentials, as the attackers would use these services to connect to the processor's network.
   - **C: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, which is not relevant to the reconnaissance phase described in the question.
   - **D: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:** This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate to systems. While it is a method of using captured credentials, it is more specific to Kerberos environments and may not be the most general method for connecting to a network.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves the attackers using captured credentials to connect to the processor's network via remote services. This aligns with the use of valid accounts (T1078) and the need to connect to the network for reconnaissance.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services
