### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10, including the use of dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2) and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for secure data transfer.
   - The focus is on the exfiltration of data from victim networks to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves using dynamic DNS to resolve C2 server addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system. While this might be a part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not directly relate to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1602.002-Network Device Configuration Dump:** This technique involves dumping configuration data from network devices. Again, this is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is a specific method of exfiltration but not over the C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control, which aligns perfectly with the use of dynamic-DNS domains for C2 and the subsequent exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
