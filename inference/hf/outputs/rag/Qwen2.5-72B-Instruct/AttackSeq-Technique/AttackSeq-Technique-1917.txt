### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT10 has conducted internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves the actor moving between Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and victims within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which is also part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network. While it is a valid lateral movement technique, it is not the most likely choice given the context of using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within a network. This is a common and effective method for moving between systems, especially after reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the loading of dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence and privilege escalation, it is not typically used for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. While it is a valid exfiltration technique, it is not relevant to the movement between systems described in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of internal reconnaissance and the need to move between systems, the most plausible technique is **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**. This technique aligns with the use of stolen credentials to move laterally within the network, which is a common and effective method after reconnaissance.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material
