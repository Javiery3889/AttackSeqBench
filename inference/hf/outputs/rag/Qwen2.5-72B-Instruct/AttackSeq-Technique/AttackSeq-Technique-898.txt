### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before base64 blobs are decoded and executed, given that KerrDown is delivered via malicious Office documents or DLL side-loading methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which is a common method for delivering malware.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating data to make it usable, which is often done after the initial delivery of the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a victim's system through a web browser, which is not directly related to the delivery methods mentioned (malicious Office documents or DLL side-loading).
   - **B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers:** This technique involves using systemd timers for persistence, which is not relevant to the initial delivery or decoding of the malware.
   - **C: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which is a method used for persistence and evasion but not for the initial delivery or decoding of the malware.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking the user into executing a malicious file, which is relevant to the delivery method via malicious Office documents.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the user is tricked into executing a malicious Office document (T1204-User Execution), which then uses DLL side-loading (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) to deliver KerrDown. After the delivery, the base64 blobs are decoded (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) and executed based on the victim's system architecture.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
