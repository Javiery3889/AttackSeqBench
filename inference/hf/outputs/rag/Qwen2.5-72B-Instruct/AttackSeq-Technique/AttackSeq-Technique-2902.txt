### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the 'yty' framework used plugins like 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots and 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering. These activities fall under the Collection tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **Tactic: Collection**
     - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**
   - This indicates that the primary activity described is the collection of data, specifically screen captures.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a target system. It is a logical next step after collecting data.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is another form of data collection. However, it is not a next step but rather a parallel or alternative method of collection.
   - **C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted non-C2 (Command and Control) protocol. This is also a logical next step after collecting data.
   - **D: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves installing a bootkit, which is a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a system. This is not a logical next step after data collection and is more related to persistence and initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible next step after collecting data (such as screen captures and system information) is to exfiltrate that data from the target system.
   - Both **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** and **C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** are valid choices, but **C** is more specific and indicates a method of exfiltration that is often used to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol
