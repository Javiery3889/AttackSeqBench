### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the Phosphorus group used ProxyShell vulnerabilities to gain access to a Microsoft Exchange Server and then deployed the PowerLess Backdoor.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these initial actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
   - This aligns with the use of ProxyShell vulnerabilities, which are public-facing application vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique is already part of the initial access phase and describes the use of ProxyShell vulnerabilities. It does not fit as the next step after gaining access and deploying the backdoor.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. It is not relevant to the sequence described, which involves server-side vulnerabilities and backdoor deployment.
   - **C: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS for command and control (C2) communications. While it could be used after gaining access, it is not the most immediate next step after deploying a backdoor.
   - **D: T1112-Modify Registry**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to maintain persistence or alter system behavior. It is a logical next step after deploying a backdoor to ensure the backdoor remains active and can be used for further attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining access and deploying the PowerLess Backdoor is to modify the registry to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1112-Modify Registry**
