### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware ensures persistence by moving to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.
   - After ensuring persistence, the malware retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves creating or modifying shortcut files (`.lnk` files) to execute malicious code when a user clicks on the shortcut.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a reference to the malware in the Windows Registry or the startup folder to ensure it runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information. It does not specifically relate to retrieving C&C configuration information.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C&C server. While it could be used to retrieve C&C configuration information, it is not specific to the method described (retrieving from blogs or microblogs).
   - **C: T1588.005-Exploits:** This technique involves using exploits to gain access to systems. It does not relate to retrieving C&C configuration information.
   - **D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data, which can be used to hide C&C configuration information. This aligns well with the description of retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after ensuring persistence, the malware uses non-standard encoding to retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

**Final Answer: D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
