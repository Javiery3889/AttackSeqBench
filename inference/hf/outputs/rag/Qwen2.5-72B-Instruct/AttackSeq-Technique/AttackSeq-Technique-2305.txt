### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an adversary uses credential stuffing to gain access to remote services such as a VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points.
   - The focus is on the technique that facilitated the initial access to these services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain an initial foothold in a network.
   - **Technique: T1133-External Remote Services** - This technique involves using valid accounts to connect to external remote services, such as a VPN or Citrix, to gain access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. This aligns well with the scenario of credential stuffing, where the adversary uses valid credentials to log into remote services.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules** - This technique involves using email hiding rules to hide malicious emails. This is not relevant to gaining initial access to remote services.
   - **C: T1200-Hardware Additions** - This technique involves adding hardware to a network to gain access. This is not relevant to the scenario of credential stuffing.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is typically used after gaining access, not for the initial access itself.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1078-Valid Accounts**. This technique directly aligns with the use of credential stuffing to gain access to remote services.

**Final Answer: A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
