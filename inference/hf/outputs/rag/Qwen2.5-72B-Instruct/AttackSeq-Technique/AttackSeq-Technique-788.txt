### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a threat actor has established persistence by setting a specific registry key to ensure the backdoor execution during user logon.
   - The registry key mentioned is `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a backdoor or malicious software is executed at boot or logon. The registry key mentioned in the question (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load`) is a common method for achieving this.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
     - This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. It does not align with the scenario of setting a registry key for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud logs to avoid detection. It does not align with the scenario of setting a registry key for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not align with the scenario of setting a registry key for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
