### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Service Worker script intercepted HTTPS POST requests to a webmail login API to steal username and password pairs.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial interception.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker is using network sniffing to intercept and steal credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. While it could be used to exfiltrate stolen credentials, it is not the most immediate next step after intercepting credentials.
   - **B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using systemd timers. It is not directly related to the interception of credentials or the immediate use of stolen credentials.
   - **C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to maintain access to a web application. After intercepting username and password pairs, an attacker might use these credentials to log in and then steal session cookies to maintain persistent access.
   - **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources. While it is a common technique in credential access, it is more relevant in a Windows environment and less likely to be the immediate next step after intercepting webmail credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after intercepting username and password pairs is to steal web session cookies to maintain persistent access to the webmail application.

**Final Answer: C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**
