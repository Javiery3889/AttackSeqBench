### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred to enable stealthy communication with the command-and-control (C2) server after the NewPass loader decoded the configuration file and extracted the agent component for deployment.
   - Key points:
     - NewPass loader decoded the configuration file.
     - Extracted the agent component for deployment.
     - Stealthy communication with the C2 server is required.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the content understandable to the adversary.
     - This is relevant because the NewPass loader decoded the configuration file, which is a form of deobfuscation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications.
     - This is a plausible choice because encrypted channels are often used to ensure stealthy communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: T1027.003-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other data to avoid detection.
     - While steganography can be used for stealth, it is less common for C2 communication and more for data exfiltration or initial payload delivery.
   - **C: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
     - This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with the C2 server.
     - This is less likely because it is a specific method of C2 communication and not typically used for stealthy communication after decoding and deployment.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.
     - This is not the most relevant choice because the question focuses on establishing communication, not exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the need for stealthy communication with the C2 server after the configuration file is decoded and the agent component is deployed, the most plausible technique is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
