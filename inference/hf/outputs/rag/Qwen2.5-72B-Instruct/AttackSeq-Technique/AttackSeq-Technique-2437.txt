### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where benign executables are used to side-load malicious DLLs, which then load the PlugX implant. After this, Mustang Panda establishes a foothold using scheduled tasks and registry modifications.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the side-loading and implant loading.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - These TTPs confirm that DLL side-loading is a key technique used in the attack sequence, but they do not provide information about what happened before this step.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the target environment. This could be a plausible step before side-loading, as the malicious DLLs and the PlugX implant need to be transferred to the target system.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While phishing could be used to gain initial access, it is not directly related to the side-loading and implant loading described in the question.
   - **C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves setting up the necessary infrastructure (e.g., domains, servers) to support the attack. This is typically done before the actual attack but is not directly related to the side-loading and implant loading.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to introduce malicious code. While this could be a method to introduce the malicious DLLs, it is less likely to be the immediate step before side-loading and implant loading.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malicious DLLs and the PlugX implant were first transferred to the target system before they were side-loaded and executed. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the side-loading and implant loading is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
