### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FIN8 uses BADHATCH to conduct system fingerprinting and discover the Domain Controller using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.
   - The next step in the sequence is to transfer a deployment script to the Domain Controller for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which is also part of the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system for further actions, which aligns with the need to transfer a deployment script to the Domain Controller.
   - **B: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves modifying authentication data to enable persistence or privilege escalation, which does not fit the context of transferring a script.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which is part of the discovery phase but does not involve transferring files.
   - **D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions, which is not relevant to the transfer of a deployment script.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of transferring a deployment script to the Domain Controller for execution, is **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
