### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Cobalt Strike Beacon has communicated with a C&C domain as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.
   - The goal is to determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that would follow to achieve significant disruption to the victim's IT infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547.015-Login Items:** This technique involves creating or modifying login items to maintain persistence. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to causing significant disruption.
   - **B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable, which is a common tactic in ransomware attacks like WastedLocker. This aligns well with the goal of significant disruption.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data, which can also cause significant disruption. However, WastedLocker is known for encrypting data rather than destroying it.
   - **D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system. While this could be used to gain further access, it is not directly related to causing significant disruption.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that WastedLocker is a ransomware attack, the most likely technique to achieve significant disruption is **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**. This technique aligns with the goal of rendering the victim's data unusable, which is a key characteristic of ransomware attacks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact
