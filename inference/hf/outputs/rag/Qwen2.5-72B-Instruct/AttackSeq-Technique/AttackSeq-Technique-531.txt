### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attempt by London Blue was blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.
   - After the initial BEC attempt was blocked, the question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This technique involves the use of email accounts to support the attack, such as creating or compromising email accounts to send phishing emails.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information or funds.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1597-Search Closed Sources:** This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources, which is not directly related to the immediate next step after a BEC attempt is blocked.
   - **B: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration, which is more relevant to the later stages of an attack, not immediately after a BEC attempt is blocked.
   - **C: T1578.001-Create Snapshot:** This technique involves creating a snapshot of the system, which is not typically a next step after a BEC attempt is blocked.
   - **D: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating a legitimate user or entity, which is a common next step after a BEC attempt is blocked. The attacker might try to impersonate a trusted individual to bypass the security measures and continue the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible next step after a BEC attempt is blocked is for the attacker to attempt impersonation to bypass the security measures and continue the attack.

**Final Answer: D: T1656-Impersonation**
