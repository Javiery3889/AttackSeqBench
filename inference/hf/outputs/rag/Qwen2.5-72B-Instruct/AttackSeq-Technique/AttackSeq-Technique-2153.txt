### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where 'EhStorAuthn.exe' is used to extract payload components and install them to a specified directory.
   - After this, FlowCloud malware sets keylogger drivers and malware configuration in the registry keys for persistence.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the persistence step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.012-Print Processors:** This technique involves modifying or creating print processors to achieve persistence.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding or modifying registry run keys or startup folder items to achieve persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using software deployment tools to distribute malware. It is not directly related to the persistence mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. While it could be the initial vector, it is not directly related to the persistence mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1137.005-Outlook Rules:** This technique involves using Outlook rules to execute malicious actions. It is not directly related to the persistence mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1137-Office Application Startup:** This technique involves using Office application startup to achieve persistence. This is a plausible technique that could be used to set up the initial execution of the malware, which then leads to the persistence mechanisms described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the installation of payload components and the setting of registry keys for persistence.
   - The most likely technique that would occur before setting the registry keys for persistence is the initial execution of the malware, which could be achieved through Office application startup.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **T1137-Office Application Startup**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1137-Office Application Startup
