### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Sayad malware communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - The data is encrypted and uploaded to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data without manual intervention.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which aligns with the scenario of uploading data to a web server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering system information, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to deliver malware, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:**
     - This technique involves limiting the size of data transfers, which is not directly relevant to the method of exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** because it directly describes the method of exfiltrating data over a web service, which matches the scenario of uploading encrypted data to a malicious web server.

**Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
