### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after the backdoor function gathers machine information during the Discovery phase, the next step is to extract visual data from the victim's system.
   - The focus is on the extraction of visual data, which implies capturing screen content.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves gathering the current system time, which is useful for understanding the victim's time zone and scheduling activities.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and hardware details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the victim's screen, which aligns with the requirement to extract visual data.
   - **B: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities:** This technique involves identifying vulnerabilities on the victim's system, which is more related to the initial reconnaissance and exploitation phases rather than extracting visual data.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with the attacker, which is more related to command and control (C2) activities rather than data extraction.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence:** This technique involves using Confluence, a collaboration tool, which is not directly related to data extraction or screen capture.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the requirement to extract visual data from the victim's system, the most plausible technique is **T1113-Screen Capture**.

**Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture**
