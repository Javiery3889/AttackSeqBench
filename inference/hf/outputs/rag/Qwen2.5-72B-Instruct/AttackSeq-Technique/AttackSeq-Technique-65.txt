### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where ScarCruft has established command and control (C2) channels using HTTP requests to specific PHP scripts on their C2 servers.
   - The focus is on the technique used to send data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Exfiltration" and the technique is "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**
     - This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms by manipulating the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) attribute. It is not related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using web services, which could be relevant, but it is not specifically tied to the C2 channel established via HTTP requests to PHP scripts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules to load malicious code. It is not related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question. The C2 channel is already established using HTTP requests to specific PHP scripts, and this technique would be used to send data from the compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by Answer Choice D.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
