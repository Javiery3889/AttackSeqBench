### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Smooth Operator collected domain and account name values from the 3CX file `config.json` as part of its discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary determining the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that have logged in to a system, or whether a user is actively using the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves the adversary degrading or disabling security tools and services. This is not directly related to the discovery phase of collecting domain and account name values.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary attempting to identify local system, domain, or service account names. This is directly related to the discovery phase and aligns with the collection of domain and account name values.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1069.001-Local Groups:** This technique involves the adversary identifying local groups and their members. While this is related to account discovery, it is more specific to group membership and not directly to collecting domain and account names.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1014-Rootkit:** This technique involves the adversary using rootkits to hide the presence of malware. This is not related to the discovery phase of collecting domain and account name values.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the adversary first performed **Account Discovery (T1087)** to identify the domain and account names before collecting them from the `config.json` file.

**Final Answer: B: T1087-Account Discovery**
