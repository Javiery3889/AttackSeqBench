### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker receives instructions from C2 (Command and Control) servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys.
   - The goal is to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encoding or encrypting files to evade detection.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information that were previously encoded or encrypted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
     - This technique involves creating autostart entries to ensure persistence. It does not align with the encoding of configuration files or the disruption of websites.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves disrupting network availability, which could be used to disrupt websites. However, it does not directly relate to the encoding of configuration files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the operating system to cause a denial of service. It is more about resource exhaustion and does not directly relate to encoding configuration files.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
     - This technique involves modifying domain properties, which is not directly related to encoding configuration files or disrupting websites.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves encoding configuration files to evade detection and then using a technique to disrupt the websites. The encoding of configuration files aligns with T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File.
   - The disruption of websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong is more likely to be achieved through a Network Denial of Service (T1498).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1498-Network Denial of Service
