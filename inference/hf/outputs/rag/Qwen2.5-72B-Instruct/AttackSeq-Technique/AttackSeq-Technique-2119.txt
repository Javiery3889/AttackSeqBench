### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where A41APT maintained persistence by registering scheduled tasks that ran legitimate executables every 15 minutes to load DESLoader.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after this persistence mechanism was established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute code, which can be part of the persistence mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules to execute code. While it can be used for execution, it is not typically a next step after setting up persistence.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions. It is more about execution and interaction with the system, but it is not a direct follow-up to setting up persistence.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access to a system. This could be a logical next step after establishing persistence, as the attacker might want to ensure they can access the system remotely.
   - **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. It is less likely to be a direct follow-up to setting up a scheduled task for persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible next step after setting up a scheduled task for persistence would be to ensure remote access to the system. This aligns with the use of external remote services (T1133).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services
