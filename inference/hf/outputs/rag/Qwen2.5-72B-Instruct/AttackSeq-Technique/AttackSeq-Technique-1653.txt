### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability is exploited to gain initial access to victim networks.
   - The next step in the sequence is to locate and secure alternative means of persistence on the victim systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between gaining initial access and securing alternative persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves tricking users into visiting a malicious website that exploits a vulnerability in their browser.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about victim identities, which is useful for social engineering or further attacks but not directly related to securing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating new accounts on the victim's system, which can be used to maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity:** This technique involves using a hybrid identity to gain access, which is more complex and typically used in later stages of an attack.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1590.002-DNS:** This technique involves manipulating DNS settings, which is not directly related to securing persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most logical step after gaining initial access and before securing alternative persistence is to create new accounts on the victim's system. This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1136-Create Account
