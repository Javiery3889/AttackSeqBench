### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after FIN8 used a script (mimi.ps1) to read the memory of lsass.exe for credential dumping but before conducting system fingerprinting with commands like `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Credential Access** and the technique is **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**. This suggests that the initial action involved credential dumping from the LSASS process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking**
     - VDSO Hijacking is a technique used to manipulate the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (VDSO) to execute arbitrary code. This is not directly related to credential dumping or system fingerprinting.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
     - This is the broader category that includes T1003.001-LSASS Memory. Since the question already mentions that credential dumping from LSASS memory has occurred, this choice is redundant and does not fit the sequence.
   - **C: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network connections on the system, which is a form of reconnaissance. It is plausible that after obtaining credentials, the attacker would perform system fingerprinting to gather more information about the system.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain**
     - Keychain is a technique used to steal credentials from the macOS Keychain. This is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after credential dumping from LSASS memory, the attacker would perform system fingerprinting to gather more information about the system. The technique that fits this sequence is **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
