### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the 'bs.dll' plugin is used for gathering system information under the Discovery tactic.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to have occurred to execute malicious plugins like 'dstr.dll' and 'grc.dll' on Windows systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is used to detect and avoid virtualized environments and sandboxes. It does not directly relate to executing malicious plugins.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**
     - This technique involves using WMI for various purposes, including remote execution and data gathering. While it can be used for execution, it is not specifically related to loading or injecting DLLs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules to execute code. This is a plausible technique for executing malicious plugins like 'dstr.dll' and 'grc.dll'.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**
     - This technique is used to gather information about cloud infrastructure. It is not relevant to executing malicious plugins on Windows systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique from the related TTPs is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**. This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which aligns with the execution of 'dstr.dll' and 'grc.dll'.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection** is also relevant as it involves injecting code into a running process, which can be used to execute malicious plugins.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is **T1129-Shared Modules** because it directly involves loading shared libraries or modules, which is a common method for executing malicious plugins.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules
