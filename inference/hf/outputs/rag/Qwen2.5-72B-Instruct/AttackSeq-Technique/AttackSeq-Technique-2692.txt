### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Elfin first scans for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets.
   - After identifying the targets, Elfin ensures code execution on unpatched systems by exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the target system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While this could be a method to gain initial access, it does not align with the spear-phishing method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with attachments that, when opened, lead to the execution of malicious code. This is close but not exactly what the question describes.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading or disabling security defenses. This is not relevant to the initial access method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code:** This technique involves using code that changes its appearance to avoid detection. This is not relevant to the initial access method described in the question.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the execution of malicious code. This aligns perfectly with the description in the question, where Elfin uses spear-phishing to exploit CVE-2018-20250.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**.

Final Answer: **B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** (Note: This is a correction based on the closest match, but the exact match is T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which is not listed in the choices. Therefore, the closest match is B.)
