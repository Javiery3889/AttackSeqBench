### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers first profiled the computer and searched for computer objects in the Active Directory database (discovery phase).
   - After this, they executed commands and performed process injection on remote computers for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network properties, which is a common step in the discovery phase.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system, which is also part of the discovery phase but is not directly related to remote system discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique fits well with the sequence described. After profiling the computer and searching for computer objects in the Active Directory, the next logical step would be to discover remote systems to target for lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.003-Thread Execution Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking threads to execute code, which is more related to the execution phase and not the discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which is typically part of the impact phase and not the discovery or lateral movement phases.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers performed **T1018-Remote System Discovery** after profiling the computer and searching for computer objects in the Active Directory database, and before executing commands and performing process injection on remote computers for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
