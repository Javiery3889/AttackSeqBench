### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to enumerate files for credential targeting and deploys malicious payloads via Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
   - The final step in the sequence involves retrieving Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information from the browser, which can include cookies, history, and other data that might contain credentials.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths, which can be used to locate sensitive files, including authentication databases.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1601-Modify System Image:** This technique involves modifying the system image, which is not directly related to exfiltrating data or retrieving authentication databases.
   - **B: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage, which is a plausible method for retrieving and storing stolen data.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not relevant to the described sequence of using file recon plugins and C2 infrastructure.
   - **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data, which is a plausible method for retrieving authentication databases from infected devices.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described involves using file recon plugins to locate and target credential files, and then deploying malicious payloads via C2 infrastructure. The final step is to retrieve the Kavach authentication databases.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the most plausible technique for this final step, as it involves automatically exfiltrating the data from the infected devices.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
