### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before T9000 (which is not a standard ATT&CK technique, but likely refers to a custom or advanced technique) compressed, encrypted, and sent collected sensitive data to its C2 server during exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not directly related to the compression and encryption of data before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique is directly related to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the final step of sending the data to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools:** This technique involves disabling or modifying tools, which is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication, which is related to the encryption of data but not specifically to the compression and exfiltration process.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves compressing, encrypting, and sending data to a C2 server. The most logical sequence would be:
     1. **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** Compress the collected data.
     2. **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** Encrypt the compressed data.
     3. **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** Send the encrypted data to the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the exfiltration over the C2 channel is the compression and archiving of the data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: **T1560-Archive Collected Data** (Answer Choice D is not listed, but the correct answer based on the sequence is T1560)
