### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the Aurora malware initially gains access through a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.
   - After gaining initial access, the malware installs itself and registers a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique describes how an adversary can gain initial access to a system by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the initial access through the JavaScript-based exploit.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique describes how an adversary can create or modify Windows services to achieve persistence, which aligns with the installation process involving the registration of a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.011-Lua:** This technique involves using Lua for command-line execution, which is not directly related to the registration of a service or the installation process described.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the registration of a service.
   - **C: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence, which aligns with the registration of a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.
   - **D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB or Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, which is not directly related to the registration of a service.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the registration of a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL, which aligns with the **T1543.003-Windows Service** technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services**
