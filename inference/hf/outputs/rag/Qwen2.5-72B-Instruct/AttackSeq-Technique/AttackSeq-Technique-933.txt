### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious macro in an Office Excel document is used for initial access. After the macro is executed, a PowerShell script decodes and writes malicious content to the %TEMP% directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as an Office document, which then executes the malicious content.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up a program to execute automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is not relevant to the sequence described, which involves immediate execution of a macro and PowerShell script.
   - **B: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands. While DDE can be used to execute commands, it is not typically used in the context of writing content to the %TEMP% directory.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting languages to execute commands. PowerShell is a specific instance of this technique, and it is directly relevant to the described sequence.
   - **D: T1055.009-Proc Memory:** This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a running process. This is not relevant to the sequence described, which involves writing content to the %TEMP% directory.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malicious macro in the Office Excel document is executed, and then a PowerShell script is used to decode and write the malicious content to the %TEMP% directory. The technique that best fits this sequence is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
