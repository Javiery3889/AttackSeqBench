### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before KiraV2 used hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication with the C&C server.
   - The context is that KiraV2 is receiving commands from the C&C server to execute DDoS attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with the C&C server.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for communication with the C&C server.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication methods if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:** This technique involves using stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate to services. It is not related to C&C communication or DDoS attacks.
   - **B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:** This technique involves using one-way communication channels, which could be relevant if the C&C server is only sending commands to the malware without expecting a response. However, it does not specifically address the use of hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate the communication between the malware and the C&C server. This is directly relevant to the use of encoded port numbers.
   - **D: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service:** This technique involves causing a denial of service on an endpoint, which is a result of the DDoS attack but not a prerequisite for C&C communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique is **T1132-Data Encoding** because it directly addresses the use of encoded port numbers, which is a key part of the communication with the C&C server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
