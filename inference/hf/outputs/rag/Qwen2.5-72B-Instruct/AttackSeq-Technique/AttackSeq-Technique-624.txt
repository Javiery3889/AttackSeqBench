### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated the introduction of ShadowPad into victim environments through supply-chain attacks like CCleaner, NetSarang, and ASUS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique is used for defense evasion by injecting code into the memory of a running process.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is also used for defense evasion by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.
   - **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique is used for initial access by compromising the software supply chain to distribute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique directly aligns with the context of the question, as it involves compromising the software supply chain to introduce malware into victim environments.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage**
     - This technique is related to defense evasion and involves manipulating thread-local storage, which is not directly relevant to the initial introduction of malware through supply-chain attacks.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing to gain initial access, which is not relevant to the supply-chain attacks mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
     - This technique involves developing new capabilities, which is a broader and more general technique and does not specifically address the initial introduction of malware through supply-chain attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated the introduction of ShadowPad into victim environments through supply-chain attacks is **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**.

**Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
