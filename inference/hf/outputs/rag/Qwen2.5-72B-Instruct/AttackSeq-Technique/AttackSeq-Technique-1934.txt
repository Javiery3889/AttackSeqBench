### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where `sysOptimizer.bat` collects personal files and `sysCrt32.exe` initializes execution components.
   - The next step in the sequence is to transfer the collected data securely to FTP servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique aligns well with the question because it involves the automated transfer of data to an external location, which in this case is an FTP server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks or jobs, which is not directly related to the transfer of data to an FTP server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files:**
     - This technique involves finding credentials in files, which is not relevant to the transfer of collected data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not the same as transferring data to an FTP server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
