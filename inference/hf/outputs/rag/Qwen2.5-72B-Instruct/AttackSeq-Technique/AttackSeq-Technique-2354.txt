### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before BRONZE PRESIDENT used phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files for initial access.
   - The focus is on the use of PlugX and other tools linked to PRC-based infrastructure development.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1587-Develop Capabilities:**
     - This technique involves developing or acquiring tools, exploits, malware, and other capabilities to support operations.
     - Given that the question mentions the use of PlugX and other tools linked to PRC-based infrastructure development, this technique aligns well with the context of developing and preparing the necessary tools before the actual attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1584.007-Serverless:**
     - This technique involves using serverless architectures to host malicious code or infrastructure.
     - This does not directly relate to the development of tools or the initial access phase described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021-Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate remote services to gain access to a system.
     - This is more relevant to the execution phase after initial access has been gained, not the preparation phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:**
     - This technique involves exploiting unquoted service paths to execute malicious code.
     - This is a post-exploitation technique and does not fit the context of the initial access or the development of tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of developing and preparing the necessary tools (PlugX and others) before the actual attack, the most plausible answer is **T1587-Develop Capabilities**.

**Final Answer: A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
