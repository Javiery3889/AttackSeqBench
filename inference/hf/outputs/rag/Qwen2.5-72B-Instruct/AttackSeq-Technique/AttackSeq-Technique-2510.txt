### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a zero-day vulnerability is exploited through phishing campaigns to deliver payloads like SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT.
   - The focus is on the technique that enables continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC (Command and Control) addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the target system.
   - **T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in an application or system to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links that, when clicked, lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with CnC servers. This is a plausible choice because it can be used to maintain continuous communication with CnC servers.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is used for initial access and involves sending phishing emails to trick users into clicking links or opening attachments. While it is part of the initial attack, it does not directly enable continuous communication with CnC servers.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network defenses. While it can be used to maintain communication, it is not the most direct method for continuous communication with hardcoded CnC addresses.
   - **D: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying tasks or services to appear legitimate. It is used to maintain persistence but does not directly enable communication with CnC servers.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for enabling continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC addresses is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is commonly used by malware to maintain a persistent connection to CnC servers using standard protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
