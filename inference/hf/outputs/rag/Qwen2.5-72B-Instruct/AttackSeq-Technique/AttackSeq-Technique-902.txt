### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious Office document is opened, macros are executed, and an in-memory payload is decrypted to evade defenses.
   - The next step in the sequence is the establishment of communication to download a payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial step of opening a malicious Office document.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves the deobfuscation or decoding of files or information, which aligns with the in-memory payload decryption to evade defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a remote system. This is a plausible next step after the payload is decrypted and the malware needs to communicate to download additional components.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the use of web services to communicate with a remote system. While this is also a form of communication, it is more specific to web-based services and might not be as general as T1071.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique has already been mentioned in the related TTPs and is part of the defense evasion phase, not the communication phase.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique involves determining the physical location of the target, which is not relevant to the communication phase of downloading a payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the need to establish communication to download a payload, the most plausible technique is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
