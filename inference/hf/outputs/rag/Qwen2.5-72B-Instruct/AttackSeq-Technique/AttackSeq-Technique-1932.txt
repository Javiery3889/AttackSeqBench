### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has obtained credentials by decrypting stored Chrome passwords. The next step in the attack sequence involves gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes for archiving personal data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**
   - **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
     - This technique involves obtaining credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the attacker decrypts stored Chrome passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not directly related to gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools into the victim's environment, which is not relevant to the gathering of clipboard contents and keystrokes.
   - **C: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a portable executable, which is not directly related to the gathering of clipboard contents and keystrokes.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing input, such as keystrokes and clipboard contents, which aligns perfectly with the described process of gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes for archiving personal data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after obtaining credentials from web browsers, the attacker uses input capture techniques to gather clipboard contents and keystrokes.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
