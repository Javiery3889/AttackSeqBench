### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the malware first uses SSL/TLS-encrypted HTTPS communications for C2 (Command and Control).
   - After this, the malware employs multi-layered obfuscation methods, including XOR encoding, to mask its C2 traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to secure C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to make it harder to detect or analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at boot or logon. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation of C2 traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation of C2 traffic.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to make it harder to detect or analyze. This aligns well with the use of multi-layered obfuscation methods, including XOR encoding, to mask C2 traffic.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port. It does not directly relate to the obfuscation of C2 traffic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **T1001-Data Obfuscation**.

**Final Answer: C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
