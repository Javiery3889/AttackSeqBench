### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through spear phishing using RTF files.
   - The next step in the sequence involves facilitating communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. However, the question specifically mentions spear phishing with RTF files, so this technique is not directly relevant to the initial access method described.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments (in this case, RTF files) to gain initial access. This aligns with the initial access method described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broader category that includes various phishing techniques, including spear phishing. However, the question is asking about the next step after initial access, not the initial access method itself.
   - **B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves manipulating the system path to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to facilitating communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic and obfuscate the communication path. While it can be used to facilitate communication, it is more complex and not the most straightforward choice for initial communication setup.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. It is a common and straightforward method for malware to establish communication with the cloud infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access via spear phishing, the malware would use a web service to facilitate communication with the cloud infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
