### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading to lateral movement using RDP.
   - The sequence involves scanning tools, stolen credentials, and then lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves using existing remote services to gain access to systems.
   - **T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** This sub-technique specifically involves using RDP for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1114.002 - Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails from remote systems. It is not directly related to lateral movement or RDP.
   - **B: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not specific to lateral movement or RDP.
   - **C: T1021 - Remote Services:** This technique involves using various remote services to move laterally. It is a broader category that includes RDP.
   - **D: T1021.007 - Cloud Services:** This sub-technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement. It is not relevant to RDP.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifies that the attackers used RDP for lateral movement. The most specific and relevant technique for this is **T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol**.
   - **T1021 - Remote Services** is a broader category that includes RDP, but it is less specific than T1021.001.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services

However, if we are to be more precise and specific, the most accurate answer would be:
Final Answer: T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol

But since T1021.001 is not listed as an answer choice, the closest and most appropriate choice is:
Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
