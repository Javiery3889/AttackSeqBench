### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where APT10:
     - Staged data for exfiltration.
     - Used multi-part archives and compression tools.
     - Launched these tools via remote command execution scripts.
     - Leveraged shared MSP infrastructure for data transfer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves using built-in utilities or third-party tools to compress and archive data.
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
     - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to capture data. It does not align with the described sequence of staging and compressing data for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving collected data, which aligns with the use of compression tools to create multi-part archives. However, it does not specifically address the exfiltration step.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**
     - This technique involves a method of process injection and does not align with the described sequence of data staging and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one intended by the design of the application. This aligns with the final step of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for data transfer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that after staging and compressing the data, the next step would be to exfiltrate the data over an alternative protocol.

**Final Answer: D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
