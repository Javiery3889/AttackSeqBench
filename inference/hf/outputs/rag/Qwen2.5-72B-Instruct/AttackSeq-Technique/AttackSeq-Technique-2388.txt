### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before LightNeuron exfiltrated data through the email C&C channel and scheduled transfers during specific times.
   - The key points are:
     - Exfiltration through the email C&C channel.
     - Scheduled transfers during specific times.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves scheduling data exfiltration at specific times to avoid detection.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which in this case is the email channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate:** This technique involves installing a root certificate to gain trust in the system. While this can be useful for maintaining persistence or evading detection, it is not directly related to the exfiltration process described.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automating the collection of data. While this is a step that might occur before exfiltration, it is not specifically about scheduling or using a C2 channel.
   - **C: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication:** This technique involves duplicating network traffic to exfiltrate data. This is more about the method of exfiltration rather than the scheduling of it.
   - **D: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique directly involves scheduling data exfiltration at specific times, which aligns with the question's description of scheduled transfers during specific times.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker first scheduled the transfer of data (T1029-Scheduled Transfer) before exfiltrating the data through the email C&C channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

**Final Answer: D: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
