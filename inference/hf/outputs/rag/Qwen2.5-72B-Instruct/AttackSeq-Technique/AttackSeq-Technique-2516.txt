### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has already compromised a computer using GreyEnergy mini, obtained domain administrator privileges using Nmap and Mimikatz, and then performed lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe, which are mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access, which is relevant to the use of domain administrator privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While this is relevant to the initial compromise and obtaining domain administrator privileges, it does not directly describe the lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to access and control systems. PsExec and WinExe are tools that leverage remote services to perform lateral movement, making this a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves tricking internal users to gain access, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**: This technique involves using WMI event subscriptions to maintain persistence, which is not relevant to the lateral movement described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of remote services to perform lateral movement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services**
