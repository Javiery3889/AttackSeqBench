### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the attack used legitimate applications to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers.
   - The key points are:
     - The attack used legitimate applications.
     - The attack collected credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:**
     - This technique involves collecting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the part of the question about collecting credentials from Internet browsers.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to collect emails, which aligns with the part of the question about local mail clients.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up programs to run automatically when a user logs in or the system boots. This does not directly follow from collecting credentials from browsers and mail clients.
   - **B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking dynamic libraries to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to the collection of credentials.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:**
     - This technique involves collecting credentials from password stores, which is a broader category that includes collecting credentials from web browsers and other password storage mechanisms. This aligns well with the context of the question.
   - **D: T1552.003-Bash History:**
     - This technique involves collecting credentials from bash history files. This is not directly related to the collection of credentials from browsers and mail clients.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after collecting credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers, the attacker would likely continue to collect credentials from other password stores to maximize the amount of sensitive information gathered.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**.

Final Answer: **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
