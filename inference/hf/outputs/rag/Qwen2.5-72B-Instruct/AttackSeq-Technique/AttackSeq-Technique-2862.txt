### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Suckfly's Nidiran backdoor has already communicated with the C&C (Command and Control) domains and has sent encrypted and hardcoded information such as the network name and operating system details.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to exfiltrate the victim's data off the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Exfiltration" and the technique is "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence on a compromised system. It is not related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using webhooks, which are HTTP callbacks. While it is a form of exfiltration, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036.009-Break Process Trees**
     - This technique involves manipulating process trees to hide the presence of malicious processes. It is not related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communication. This aligns perfectly with the related TTPs and the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel."

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
