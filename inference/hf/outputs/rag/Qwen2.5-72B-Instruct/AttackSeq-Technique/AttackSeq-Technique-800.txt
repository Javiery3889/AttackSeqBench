### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker bypassed security detection by using a renamed `certutil.exe` (renamed to `gosia.exe`) to decode a base64 blob, decompress its contents, and execute a JavaScript file.
   - The key points are:
     - Bypassing security detection.
     - Using a renamed executable.
     - Decoding and decompressing a base64 blob.
     - Executing a JavaScript file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves adversaries using various methods to deobfuscate or decode files or information that were previously obfuscated or encoded to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying or replacing dynamic library files to execute arbitrary code. It does not align with the described sequence of decoding and executing a script.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1197-BITS Jobs**
     - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It does not align with the described sequence of decoding and executing a script.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
     - This technique involves executing commands indirectly through other mechanisms, such as scripts or other executables. While it is related to command execution, it does not specifically address the decoding and decompression steps.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. It aligns well with the described sequence, as the JavaScript file is executed after decoding and decompression.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
