### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker performs DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe` and then ensures that T9000's components run or load with every user mode process after a system reboot.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves adding a DLL to the AppInit_DLLs registry key, which causes the DLL to be loaded into every user-mode process that uses the User32.dll library.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, often by placing the malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is used to detect and evade virtualized environments and sandboxes. It does not ensure persistence or loading of components with every user mode process.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**
     - This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection. It does not ensure persistence or loading of components with every user mode process.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a program or script runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is a broad category that includes several sub-techniques, such as AppInit DLLs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. It does not specifically ensure that components load with every user mode process.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for ensuring that T9000's components run or load with every user mode process after a system reboot is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**, specifically the sub-technique **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**. This technique aligns with the requirement to load a DLL into every user-mode process.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
