### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware uses process name hashing and impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware employed timestomping to modify file timestamps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp** (which is the technique for modifying file timestamps to evade detection).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to coincide with specific events or times. While it is a defense evasion technique, it does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which can include timestomping. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred before timestomping.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows registry, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**
     - This technique involves re-opening applications to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the malware first evading detection by impersonating a legitimate executable and then modifying file timestamps to further evade detection.
   - The technique that most likely occurred before timestomping is **T1070-Indicator Removal**. This is because timestomping is a specific form of indicator removal, and the question asks for the technique that occurred before timestomping.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal
