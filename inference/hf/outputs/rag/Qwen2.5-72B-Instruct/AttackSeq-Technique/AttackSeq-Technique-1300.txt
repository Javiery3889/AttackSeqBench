### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via a hidden object in an Excel document.
   - It then asks about a technique used to evade detection before moving on to credential access techniques like searching for stored passwords in registry keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Excel) to execute malicious code.
   - **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1110.003-Password Spraying**
     - This technique involves attempting to log in to many accounts with a few commonly used passwords. It is a credential access technique and does not fit the context of evading detection after initial exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. While it can be used for command and control, it does not directly relate to concealing malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
     - This technique involves hiding files and directories, which aligns with the context of evading detection after initial exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This is a broader technique that includes various methods of hiding artifacts, including hidden files and directories. It is a more general category that encompasses T1564.001.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the specific context of hiding files and directories to evade detection, the most precise and relevant answer is **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**.

**Final Answer: C: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
