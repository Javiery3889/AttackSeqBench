### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after a PowerShell command was executed upon opening a malicious shortcut file and before the Asruex malware communicated with a C&C server over HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it before exfiltration or communication. It is plausible that data encoding could occur before communication with a C&C server to avoid detection.
   - **B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys:** This technique involves adding a public key to the authorized keys file to gain persistent access. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves techniques to detect and avoid virtualized environments or sandboxes. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **D: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of events is that after the PowerShell command is executed, the malware might encode the data it needs to send to the C&C server to avoid detection. This encoding would occur before the actual communication over HTTP.
   - The other techniques (B, C, and D) do not fit the sequence of events as well as T1132-Data Encoding.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1132-Data Encoding
