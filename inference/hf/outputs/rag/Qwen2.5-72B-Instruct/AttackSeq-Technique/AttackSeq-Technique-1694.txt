### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before Bvp47 (a known malware) established connections to external systems and initiated communication between host A and V1, facilitating initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic and obfuscate the origin of the communication.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to gain access to a system. While this could be a method for initial access, it is not as specific to the context of Bvp47 and the use of valid accounts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. This is a common method for initial access but does not align well with the use of valid accounts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a client application to execute code. This is a method for gaining initial access but does not align with the use of valid accounts.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1550.001-Application Access Token:** This technique involves using application access tokens to gain access to a system. This is a method for maintaining access but not for initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the related TTPs and the context of the question is the use of valid accounts (T1078) to gain initial access. This aligns with the need to establish connections to external systems and facilitate communication, which is a common step after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most appropriate answer based on the context of using valid accounts and the related TTPs is:

Final Answer: **T1078-Valid Accounts** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most accurate based on the context. If we must choose from the given options, the closest would be B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise, but it is not the most accurate.)
