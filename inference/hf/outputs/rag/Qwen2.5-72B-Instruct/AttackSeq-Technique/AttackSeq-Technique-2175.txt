### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses spear phishing emails to evaluate software installed on a victim's computer through GET requests to third-party websites.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to gain access to the victim's device.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This sub-technique involves using spear phishing with a link to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access. It does not fit the context of using spear phishing emails to evaluate software.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gather information, but it does not specifically mention gaining access to the victim's device.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which aligns with the use of spear phishing emails to gain access to the victim's device.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1123-Audio Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing audio from the victim's device, which is not relevant to the initial access phase described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1566-Phishing**.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
