### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker bypasses blocking of active C&C servers through Telegram channels, executes malicious stealers to gather system and sensitive data, and then uses a technique to obscure communication and maintain access undetected.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain command and control (C&C) over a compromised system.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to host C&C infrastructure. While it can be used to maintain communication, it does not specifically address the need to obscure communication or maintain access undetected.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for remote access. It is more about gaining access rather than maintaining it undetected.
   - **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to maintain access. It is more about authentication and access rather than communication.
   - **D: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols and services to blend in with normal traffic, making it harder to detect malicious communication. This aligns well with the need to obscure communication and maintain access undetected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need to obscure communication and maintain access undetected, the most plausible answer is **D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**.

Final Answer: D: T1205-Traffic Signaling
