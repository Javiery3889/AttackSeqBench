### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers use modules like 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' to collect system information, including browser history and external IP addresses, before deploying persistence modules.
   - The focus is on the reconnaissance phase, specifically on network discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries attempting to get information about the network configuration of systems they are accessing.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries attempting to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including the version, patches, and other details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies:** This technique involves identifying and exploiting trust relationships between systems or networks. It is not directly related to the initial collection of system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller:** This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to capture credentials and other sensitive information. It is not relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a victim's network. It is not relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the described use of 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' to gather system and network information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**.

**Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
