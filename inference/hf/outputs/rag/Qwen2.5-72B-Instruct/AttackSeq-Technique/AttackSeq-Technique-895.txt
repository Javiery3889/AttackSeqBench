### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Ensuring the integrity of the malicious payload using a sha256 checksum.
     - Bypassing detection with an encrypted shellcode.
     - Loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Tactic: Defense Evasion):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Tactic: Defense Evasion):** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make the payload executable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying a container to execute malicious code. It does not align with the specific action of loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions. While it could be used to load a DLL, it is not the most specific technique for the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with a command and control server. It does not align with the action of loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It does not align with the specific action of loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is the most relevant because it directly involves loading a malicious DLL to execute code, which aligns with the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**.

Final Answer: **B: T1106-Native API** (However, the most specific and relevant technique is T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, but since it is not listed as an answer choice, the closest relevant choice is B: T1106-Native API). 

However, if we strictly follow the provided answer choices and the most relevant technique, the final answer should be:

Final Answer: **B: T1106-Native API**
