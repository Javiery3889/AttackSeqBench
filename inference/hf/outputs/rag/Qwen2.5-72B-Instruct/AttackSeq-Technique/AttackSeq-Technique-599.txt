### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after using proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration to establish communication with malicious external websites.
   - Key points: 
     - Proxy tools (e.g., Ngrok) are used.
     - Lateral movement and data exfiltration are involved.
     - Communication with malicious external websites is established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from chat messages, which is not directly relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate network protocols to blend in with normal traffic, which is not directly related to the use of proxy tools for communication with external websites.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports to communicate, which could be relevant but is not the most direct follow-up to using a proxy tool.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server, which aligns well with the use of proxy tools to establish communication with external websites.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands, which is not directly related to the communication aspect described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of using proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration to establish communication with malicious external websites, the most plausible technique that would follow is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
