### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT28 has already harvested credentials via spear-phishing and used OLDBAIT (a technique for reusing old malware or exploits).
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to move deeper into the victim's network after exploiting internet-facing servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems.
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This sub-technique involves collecting credentials for later use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access and harvesting credentials.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This sub-technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network. While possible, it is less likely to be the immediate next step after exploiting internet-facing servers.
   - **C: T1653-Power Settings:** This technique involves manipulating power settings to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to moving deeper into the network.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While important, it is not the primary focus of moving deeper into the network.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after exploiting internet-facing servers and harvesting credentials is to exploit remote services to move deeper into the network. This aligns with the T1210 technique.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
