### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Regin utilized its remote access Trojan (RAT) features for collecting data, specifically screen capture.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Collection" and the technique is "T1113-Screen Capture."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This is the technique mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question asks what technique occurred **before** screen capture.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which could be a step before screen capture to gather additional context or data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules, which could be part of the initial setup or deployment of the RAT but is not directly related to the collection of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying a container, which is not typically a step in the data collection process and is more related to infrastructure setup.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that before Regin utilized its RAT features for screen capture, it would have collected data from information repositories to gather additional context or data. This aligns with the typical attack sequence where initial data collection is performed to understand the environment before more specific data collection techniques like screen capture are used.

### Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
