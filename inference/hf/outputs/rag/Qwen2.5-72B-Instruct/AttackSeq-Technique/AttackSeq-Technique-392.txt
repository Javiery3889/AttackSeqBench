### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Vyveva's backdoor collects files from the system and newly inserted removable media.
   - The collected data is then sent to the C&C server in an encrypted manner.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration of the collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the part of the question where the backdoor collects files from newly inserted removable media.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the part of the question where the collected data is sent to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated methods to collect data, which is relevant to the collection phase but not specifically to the step before exfiltration.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique is directly related to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving the collected data before exfiltration, which is a plausible step that could occur before the data is exfiltrated.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves collecting data from the system and removable media, and then exfiltrating the data over a C2 channel.
   - Before exfiltration, it is common for attackers to archive or compress the collected data to make the exfiltration process more efficient and less detectable.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before exfiltration is **T1560-Archive Collected Data**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1560-Archive Collected Data
