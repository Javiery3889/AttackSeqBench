### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the IEXPL0RE RAT is delivered via a social engineering email attachment. The email attachment uses Unicode right-to-left override characters and password-protected archives.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the RAT was delivered.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.002-Right-to-Left Override:** This technique involves using Unicode right-to-left override characters to disguise file names or other text, making it harder for defenders to detect malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1098.005-Device Registration:** This technique involves registering a new device with a service or application to maintain persistence. This is not typically the next step after delivering a RAT via email.
   - **B: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process by using a dynamic-link library (DLL). This is a common post-exploitation technique to maintain persistence or execute additional payloads.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This is a common next step after gaining initial access to establish communication with the attacker.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute it in the context of that process. This is similar to B but more general.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most likely next step after delivering the RAT via a spearphishing email would be to establish communication with the C2 server. This is typically done using common application layer protocols to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
