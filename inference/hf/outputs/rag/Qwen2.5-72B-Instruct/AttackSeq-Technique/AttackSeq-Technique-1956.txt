### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by PlugX to maintain its foothold on the host after using a malicious DLL for Defense Evasion.
   - The key points are:
     - PlugX uses a malicious DLL.
     - The DLL is used for Defense Evasion.
     - We need to identify the technique for maintaining persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that they appear legitimate to evade detection.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique is about exfiltrating data, not maintaining persistence.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile:** This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute code at logon, which is another method for maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not related to maintaining persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** and **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** are both techniques for maintaining persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is a broader and more common technique that can be used in various scenarios, including after a DLL side-loading attack.
   - **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** is more specific to PowerShell and might not be as broadly applicable.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
