### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the deployment of RYUK ransomware after exfiltration using SmartFTP Client.
   - The key points are:
     - Exfiltration has already occurred.
     - The next step is to disable protections.
     - Finally, RYUK ransomware is deployed.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, which is a key characteristic of ransomware.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1127.001-MSBuild:**
     - MSBuild is a build tool that can be used to compile and execute code. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not directly related to the sequence of disabling protections and deploying ransomware.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:**
     - This is the technique used by RYUK ransomware to encrypt data. However, the question asks about the step before deploying RYUK, not the deployment itself.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1495-Firmware Corruption:**
     - Firmware corruption is a technique that involves corrupting firmware to cause system instability or failure. This is not typically a step in the sequence of deploying ransomware.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:**
     - Native API calls can be used to interact with the operating system at a low level, which can be useful for disabling protections and preparing the system for ransomware deployment.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. Exfiltration using SmartFTP Client.
     2. Disabling protections using Native API calls (T1106).
     3. Deploying RYUK ransomware (T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
