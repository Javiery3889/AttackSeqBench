### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique SideCopy APT group used to tailor their campaigns towards targeting government and military personnel by aligning their themes and decoys with operational documents and military contexts.
   - The focus is on the initial phase of the attack, specifically the reconnaissance and resource development stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves registering or acquiring domains to use in campaigns, which can be part of the resource development phase.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves using malicious files (like LNK files) to execute code on a victim's system, which is part of the execution phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the target organization, which is crucial for tailoring campaigns to specific targets. This aligns well with the question's focus on aligning themes and decoys with operational documents and military contexts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is more relevant to the post-compromise phase and not the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:**
     - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets, which is a broader reconnaissance technique but not specifically tailored to aligning themes and decoys.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547.002-Authentication Package:**
     - This technique involves modifying the authentication process, which is more relevant to persistence and not the initial reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**. This technique is crucial for tailoring campaigns to specific targets, such as government and military personnel, by aligning themes and decoys with operational documents and military contexts.

**Final Answer: A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
