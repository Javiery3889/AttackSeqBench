### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Regin utilized its ability to gather information on processes, memory utilization, and monitor network traffic during its discovery phase.
   - The key points are:
     - Regin's discovery phase.
     - Gathering information on processes, memory utilization, and network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which aligns with the discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**
     - This technique involves blocking indicators to evade detection, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about running processes, which also aligns with the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server**
     - This technique involves using a virtual private server, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.
   - **B: T1110.001-Password Guessing**
     - This technique involves guessing passwords, which is more related to credential access rather than the discovery phase.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is also more related to credential access rather than the discovery phase.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over alternative protocols, which is more related to the exfiltration phase.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the question focuses on the discovery phase and the related TTPs (T1082 and T1057) are both discovery techniques, the most plausible next step after gathering information on processes, memory utilization, and network traffic would be to exfiltrate the gathered data.
   - Exfiltration is a logical next step after the discovery phase, as the attacker would want to send the collected information back to their command and control server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
