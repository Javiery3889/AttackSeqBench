### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers used ransomware to disrupt operations in healthcare facilities. They stole data before encrypting copies for ransom demands.
   - The key points are:
     - Data theft
     - Data encryption for ransom

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Impact
     - Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact
   - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, which is a common tactic in ransomware attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves disrupting network availability, which is not directly related to data theft or encryption.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
     - This technique directly aligns with the scenario described, where data is encrypted to prevent access, which is a key step in ransomware attacks.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to data theft or encryption.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information, which is more about hiding malicious activities rather than directly impacting data availability.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact after stealing data.

**Final Answer: B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
