### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Machete has collected and staged encrypted logs and files in a temporary directory.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices. It is not relevant to the communication with C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to make it appear benign or to bypass detection. While it could be used in the exfiltration process, it does not directly address the communication over FTP and HTTP.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying a container to run malicious code. It is not relevant to the communication with C&C servers over FTP and HTTP.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols (such as FTP and HTTP) to communicate with C&C servers. This is the most relevant technique given the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of common application layer protocols (FTP and HTTP) to communicate with remote C&C servers.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
