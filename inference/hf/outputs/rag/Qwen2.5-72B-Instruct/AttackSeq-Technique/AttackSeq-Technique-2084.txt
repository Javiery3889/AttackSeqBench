### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where RIG EK (Exploit Kit) fetches malware from a C&C (Command and Control) infrastructure using an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - The malware is transmitted securely using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating or encrypting files or information to avoid detection.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell for execution.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control communications. Given that the malware is transmitted securely using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm, this technique is highly relevant.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal traffic. While this could be part of the attack, it does not specifically address the secure transmission of the exploit code.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the search order to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the secure transmission of the exploit code.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of the command and control traffic. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not specifically address the secure transmission of the exploit code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the secure transmission of the exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm, is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
