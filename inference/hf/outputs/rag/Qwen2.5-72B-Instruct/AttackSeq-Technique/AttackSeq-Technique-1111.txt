### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers have achieved persistence by creating a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image'.
   - The next step in the sequence is the communication of a PlugX variant with C2 domains using specific ports (80, 443, 53, 8000) over TCP and UDP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using ports that are not commonly associated with the service they are communicating with, which can help evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**
     - This technique involves hiding files and directories to avoid detection. While it is useful for maintaining stealth, it is not directly related to the communication with C2 domains.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This is a broader technique that includes hiding various artifacts, including files, directories, and processes. It is also not directly related to the communication with C2 domains.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070.005-Network Share Connection Removal**
     - This technique involves removing network share connections to cover tracks. It is not directly related to the communication with C2 domains.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with C2 servers. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically address the use of non-standard ports.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the communication with C2 domains using non-standard ports is **T1571-Non-Standard Port**. This technique is directly related to the use of ports that are not typically associated with the services they are communicating with, which aligns with the described behavior of the PlugX variant.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1571-Non-Standard Port**
