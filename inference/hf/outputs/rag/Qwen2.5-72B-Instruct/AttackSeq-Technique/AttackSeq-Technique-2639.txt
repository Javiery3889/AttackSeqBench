### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to gather files from local systems and removable media before exfiltration.
   - The exfiltration is described as being done using encryption and compression over C&C channels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique aligns with the question's requirement to gather files from local systems and removable media.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1134.005-SID-History Injection:**
     - This technique is related to privilege escalation and does not involve data collection or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique is about exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is mentioned in the question but is not the technique used to gather the data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1114-Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting email data, which is not mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the data was first collected from removable media (T1025) before being exfiltrated over the C2 channel (T1041).

**Final Answer: A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
