### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where lightSpy establishes execution, installs a modular backdoor, and then maintains evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1587.004-Exploits (Resource Development):** This technique involves the use of exploits to gain initial access or to escalate privileges.
   - **T1553.002-Code Signing (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves subverting trust controls by using signed code to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While it is a common technique for initial execution, it does not directly relate to maintaining evasion through code signing or exploiting a Safari bug.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**
     - This technique involves manipulating DHCP responses to redirect network traffic. It is not relevant to the described evasion method of using a signed Apple developer certificate.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which aligns with the use of a signed Apple developer certificate to maintain evasion. The specific sub-technique T1553.002-Code Signing is directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
     - This technique involves reducing the key space in cryptographic attacks, which is not relevant to the described evasion method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**.

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
