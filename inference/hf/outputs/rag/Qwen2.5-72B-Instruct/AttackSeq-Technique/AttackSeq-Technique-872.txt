### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by GreyEnergy operators:
     - They used tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials.
     - They then redirected requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.
   - The focus is on the technique that occurred before the redirection through internal C&C proxies.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool:** This technique involves acquiring or developing tools to support operations.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This is a broader technique that includes using proxies to route traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management:** This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote access. While it could be used for lateral movement, it doesn't directly relate to the setup of C&C communication.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access. It is more about initial access or lateral movement, not specifically about setting up C&C communication.
   - **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. It is not directly related to the setup of C&C communication.
   - **D: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks. It is more about post-exploitation activities and not directly related to setting up C&C communication.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most relevant technique to the setup of C&C communication is **T1090.002-External Proxy**. This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic, which aligns with the described action of redirecting requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most accurate and relevant technique that fits the sequence described is **T1090.002-External Proxy**. Since this is not one of the answer choices, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**

But for the most accurate answer, it should be noted that **T1090.002-External Proxy** is the technique that directly aligns with the described action.
