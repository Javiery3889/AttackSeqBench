### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT12 used spear phishing emails to exploit CVE-2012-0158 for initial access.
   - The focus is on the Command and Control (C2) phase, specifically involving HIGHTIDE's communication with an IP address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the target system.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious content to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names to avoid detection. While it could be used in C2, it is not specifically about encrypted communication.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial access phase, not the C2 phase.
   - **C: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection. It is more relevant to the exfiltration or persistence phases rather than C2.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server, which aligns well with the C2 phase and the use of HIGHTIDE for communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the C2 phase involving HIGHTIDE's communication with an IP address is the use of an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
