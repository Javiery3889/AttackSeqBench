### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where data has been collected using `sysOptimizer.bat` and other components. The data includes keylogged data, clipboard content, and personal files.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to transfer this data to an FTP server operated by SecondEye.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of collected data to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the collection process described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to the victim's system, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using webhooks, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal:** This technique involves bypassing network address translation, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols, which could include FTP.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for transferring collected data to an FTP server is **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**. FTP is an alternative protocol to standard HTTP or HTTPS, and it is commonly used for file transfer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
