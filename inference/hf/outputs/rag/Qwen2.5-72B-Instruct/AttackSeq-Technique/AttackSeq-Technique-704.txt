### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where TA505:
     - Deployed Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
     - Maintained access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves altering the Component Object Model (COM) to execute arbitrary code when a legitimate application or service is started.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059.009-Cloud API:**
     - This technique involves using cloud service APIs to execute commands. It does not align with the described sequence of hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its COM handler.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1505.004-IIS Components:**
     - This technique involves using IIS components for persistence. It does not align with the described sequence of hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its COM handler.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to maintain persistence. While it is a form of persistence, it does not specifically involve hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its COM handler.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. It does not align with the described sequence of hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its COM handler.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**. This technique aligns with the described action of hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most accurate answer based on the related TTPs and the described sequence is:

**Final Answer: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** (which is not listed in the answer choices, but the closest match is C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, which is a form of persistence but not the exact technique described). 

Given the choices, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
