### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - Payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - The final step involves using a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection to inject the final payload DLL into memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which is consistent with the use of Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which is also consistent with the use of Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
   - **T1055-Process Injection:** This is a broader category that includes various methods of injecting code into processes, including DLL injection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1587.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malware, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute payloads, which is mentioned in the question but is not the step that occurs before the PowerShell loader.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules to load code, which is not directly related to the sequence described.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question states that the payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - After the backdoor is downloaded, the next step is to inject the final payload DLL into memory using a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
   - The most relevant technique for injecting the final payload DLL into memory is **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**

However, based on the sequence described, the most relevant technique that occurs before the PowerShell loader is used to inject the final payload DLL into memory is **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**. Therefore, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: **D: T1129-Shared Modules** (This is incorrect based on the sequence described. The correct answer should be T1055.001, but it is not listed as an option. The closest correct answer is C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, but it is not the final step before the injection.) 

Given the options, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
