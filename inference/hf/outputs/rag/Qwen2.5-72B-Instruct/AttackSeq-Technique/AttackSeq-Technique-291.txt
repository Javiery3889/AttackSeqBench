### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a backdoor is used to steal Google Chrome credentials, and then pings to the C2 server are transmitted at regular intervals.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the pings to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the part of the question about stealing Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves checking for an active internet connection, which is a logical step before transmitting pings to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery:** This technique involves identifying permission groups and is more relevant to privilege escalation and lateral movement, not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a system through a user visiting a malicious website, which is an initial access technique and not directly related to the sequence after credential theft.
   - **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data from cloud storage, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automatically collecting data, which could be relevant but is not as specific as checking for an internet connection before transmitting pings.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most logical step before transmitting pings to the C2 server would be to ensure that the system has an active internet connection. This aligns with the technique **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** (This is incorrect based on the reasoning. The correct answer is **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**, but since it is not listed, the closest logical choice is **D: T1119-Automated Collection**.)

However, if we strictly follow the provided choices and the most logical sequence, the best answer is:

Final Answer: **D: T1119-Automated Collection**
