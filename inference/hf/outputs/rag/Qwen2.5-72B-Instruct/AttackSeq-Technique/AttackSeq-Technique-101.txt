### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses API hooking to evade detection, modifies functions in memory, and then establishes communication with a C&C server and loads incoming executables.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the communication and loading of executables.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves directly invoking native APIs to perform actions, which can be used to evade detection and manipulate system functions.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules to execute code, which can be used to load additional components or executables.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C&C) communications. While it is relevant to the communication phase, it does not fit the context of what happens before the communication.
   - **T1586.003-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using cloud accounts to facilitate C&C communications. It is not directly related to the execution phase or the loading of executables.
   - **T1569.002-Service Execution:** This technique involves executing code via services. While it is related to execution, it does not specifically align with the use of API hooking and loading of executables.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules, which can be used to load additional executables. This aligns well with the context of loading incoming executables after establishing communication with the C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker used **T1129-Shared Modules** to load the incoming executables after establishing communication with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
