### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading to the execution of commands to install SparrowDoor by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The initial access was gained through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting client applications to execute code on a target system.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:** This technique involves acquiring infrastructure to support operations, such as registering domains or setting up servers. This is not directly related to the sequence of gaining initial access and executing commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model:** This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement. While it is a lateral movement technique, it is not directly related to the initial access or execution of commands.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server:** This technique involves acquiring a virtual private server (VPS) to support operations. Similar to T1583, this is not directly related to the sequence of gaining initial access and executing commands.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This is a common technique used to hide malicious activities, and it can be used before or during the execution of commands to install SparrowDoor.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability (T1190), the threat actor would likely use obfuscation techniques (T1027) to hide the commands and files used to install SparrowDoor. This aligns with the context of the question and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
