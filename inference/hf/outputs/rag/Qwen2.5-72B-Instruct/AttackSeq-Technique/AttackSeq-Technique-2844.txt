### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware sends system information to a C2 server using the command line.
   - The communication with the C2 server is over HTTPS using the POST method.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the technique is "T1071.001-Web Protocols."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a C2 server. It is not relevant to the use of HTTPS and POST methods.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. The sub-technique T1071.001-Web Protocols is specifically mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the use of HTTPS and POST methods.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools, which is not relevant to the communication method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
     - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance, which is not relevant to the communication method described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the communication method, the most plausible answer is **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
