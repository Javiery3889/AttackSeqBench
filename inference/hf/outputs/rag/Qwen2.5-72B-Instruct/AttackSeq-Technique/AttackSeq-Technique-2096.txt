### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network.
   - The key phrase here is "discover and map the organization's internal network."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which is a crucial step in mapping the internal network.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which is another important step in understanding the internal network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is typically an initial access technique and not a discovery technique.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement, which is not directly related to discovering and mapping the internal network.
   - **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to other systems within the network, which is a lateral movement technique and not a discovery technique.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:** This technique involves determining the physical locations of systems, which is not directly related to network discovery.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that after using the Cobalt Strike beacon, the Carbanak group would use techniques to discover and map the internal network.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** and **T1046-Network Service Discovery** are both discovery techniques that align with the question's context.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** is not the correct answer. The most plausible answer is **T1018-Remote System Discovery** or **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. However, since the question asks for a single technique, the most relevant and direct answer is:

**Final Answer: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
