### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers gained initial access by modifying a Javascript file on a CDN server to load additional malicious code.
   - The next step in the sequence is the attackers evading detection using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.002-Software Packing:** This technique involves using packers to obfuscate or compress code to evade detection.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This is a broader technique that includes various methods to obfuscate code, including software packing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack:** This technique involves forcing a system to use a less secure protocol or configuration. It does not align with the described sequence of modifying a Javascript file and using a packer.
   - **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not relevant to the described sequence of modifying a Javascript file and using a packer.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system by having them visit a malicious website. While it could be related to the initial access, it does not directly describe the use of a packer to evade detection.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating code to evade detection, which aligns with the use of the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information to evade detection after gaining initial access by modifying the Javascript file.

**Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
