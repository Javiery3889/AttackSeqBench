### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a custom VBS backdoor has been deployed and VBS scripts have been executed for data collection.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with the attacker's servers and download additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with the attacker's servers.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves executing Visual Basic scripts, which aligns with the VBS backdoor and scripts mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with the attacker's servers. This aligns well with the need to establish communication and download additional payloads.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While this could be a part of the communication, it is not the primary technique for establishing communication and downloading payloads.
   - **C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job:** This technique involves using container orchestration jobs to schedule tasks. This is not relevant to the scenario of establishing communication and downloading payloads.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves scheduling tasks to execute at specific times. While this could be used to schedule the execution of the VBS backdoor, it does not directly address the communication and payload download.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need to establish communication and download additional payloads, the most plausible answer is **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
