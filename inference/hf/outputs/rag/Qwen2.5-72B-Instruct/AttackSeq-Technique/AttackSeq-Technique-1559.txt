### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before APT42 gained initial access via spear phishing and bypassing MFA.
   - The focus is on the preparatory phase, specifically on techniques that complement credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad category that includes various phishing methods.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This is a specific method of phishing where the attacker sends a link to the target.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This is a reconnaissance technique where the attacker uses spearphishing links to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate:** This technique involves installing a root certificate to gain trust in the system. It is more relevant to maintaining access or establishing persistence rather than initial reconnaissance or credential harvesting.
   - **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing custom tools or capabilities. While it could be relevant to the development of lightweight tools and custom backdoors, it is not specifically tied to the initial access phase.
   - **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts:** This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information. It is a reconnaissance technique that can be used to gather information about targets, which can complement credential harvesting efforts.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves spearphishing within an organization. It is more relevant to internal lateral movement rather than the initial access phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve reconnaissance to gather information about the targets before engaging them with spear phishing. The technique that best fits this context is **T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts
