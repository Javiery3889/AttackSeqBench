### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and saves the output. After this, the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to control the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:** This technique involves using a one-way communication channel for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1135-Network Share Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network shares and is not directly related to command and control or communication with compromised websites.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves tunneling protocols to hide command and control traffic, but it is not specifically about communicating with compromised websites.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services for command and control, which aligns with the description of communicating with compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs, which is not directly related to the communication described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the attack sequence, the most plausible answer is **C: T1102-Web Service**. This technique fits the scenario where the backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
