### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where GreyEnergy uses tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement within a compromised network.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before GreyEnergy obtained domain administrator privileges by collecting passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using existing, legitimate accounts (such as domain accounts) to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using existing, legitimate accounts (such as domain accounts) to escalate privileges within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services (like RDP) to gain access to a network. While it can be used for initial access, it doesn't directly relate to the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving API functions to evade detection. It is more related to malware obfuscation and does not fit the context of lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using various remote services (like PsExec, WinExe, RDP) to move laterally within a network. This aligns well with the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network. While it can be used to gain initial access, it doesn't directly relate to the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement or the collection of domain administrator passwords.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that GreyEnergy used remote services (T1021) to move laterally within the network. After gaining access to multiple systems, they likely used domain accounts (T1078.002) to escalate privileges and collect domain administrator passwords.

### Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
