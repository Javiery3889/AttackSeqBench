### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used before gaining initial access by remotely controlling software or creating new local accounts on internal hosts.
   - The techniques mentioned include enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force:** This technique involves attempting to log in to accounts by guessing passwords.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using existing local accounts to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning:**
     - This technique involves actively probing and scanning for information about a target, which aligns with the activities of enumerating services and scanning ports.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1590.001-Domain Properties:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about domain properties, which is not directly related to scanning or brute-forcing.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1090.002-External Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic, which is not related to the activities mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1197-BITS Jobs:**
     - This technique involves using Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs to transfer files, which is not related to scanning or brute-forcing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves active scanning to enumerate services and scan ports, followed by brute-forcing to gain access, and then creating local accounts.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **T1595-Active Scanning**.

**Final Answer: A: T1595-Active Scanning**
