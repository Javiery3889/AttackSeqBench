### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where TA453 targeted senior medical professionals with credential phishing emails.
   - The emails redirected the recipients to a spoofed Microsoft login page hosted on 1drv[.]casa.
   - The objective was to harvest credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which aligns with the initial step of sending phishing emails.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending targeted emails with links to malicious sites, which matches the description of the emails redirecting to a spoofed Microsoft login page.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1552-Unsecured Credentials:** This technique involves accessing credentials that are stored in an unsecured manner. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly describe the initial phishing attack.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules:** This technique involves using email rules to hide malicious emails. This is not relevant to the described scenario.
   - **C: T1606-Forge Web Credentials:** This technique involves creating fake credentials, which is not the primary focus of the described attack.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which directly aligns with the described scenario of sending credential phishing emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1566-Phishing**.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
