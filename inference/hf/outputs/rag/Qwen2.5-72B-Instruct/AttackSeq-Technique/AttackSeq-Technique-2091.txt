### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after Carbanak used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and enumerate remote systems but before they moved laterally across the infrastructure in search of critical information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their details, which aligns with the mapping and enumeration of the internal network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally across the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to remote systems to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1652-Device Driver Discovery:** This technique involves identifying device drivers on the system, which is not directly related to the sequence of mapping the network and moving laterally.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is a common step before lateral movement but not necessarily a direct step between network mapping and lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification:** This technique involves changing file and directory permissions, which is more related to persistence and defense evasion rather than the discovery and lateral movement sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their details, which aligns perfectly with the step of mapping the internal network and enumerating remote systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred after mapping the internal network and before lateral movement is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
