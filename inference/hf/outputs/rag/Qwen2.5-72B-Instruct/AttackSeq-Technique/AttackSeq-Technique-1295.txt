### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has established persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into `explorer.exe` to maintain the Poison Ivy server process.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using a port that is not commonly associated with a specific service to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using a protocol that is not typically used for the application layer to communicate with a C2 server, often to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation:** This technique is related to generating requests for multi-factor authentication, which is not relevant to securing communication over a custom network protocol.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to securing communication using a custom network protocol.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution:** This technique involves executing code in response to specific events, which is more related to persistence and not to securing communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to secure communication channels, which aligns with the need to secure communication using a custom network protocol.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP, is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
