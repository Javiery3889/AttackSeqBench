### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the LightNeuron malware.
   - It starts with the malware discovering system network configurations using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
   - It ends with the malware using a backdoor function to exfiltrate locally collected data.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred in between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is `T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery`, which aligns with the initial action of discovering system network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**: This technique involves modifying a network provider DLL to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This is not directly related to the discovery or exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a logical step after discovering network configurations and before exfiltrating data.
   - **C: T1123-Audio Capture**: This technique involves capturing audio from the system, which is not typically a step in the exfiltration process and is not related to the discovery of network configurations.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions is: Discover network configurations -> Collect data from the local system -> Exfiltrate data.
   - The most logical step between discovering network configurations and exfiltrating data is collecting data from the local system.

### Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System
