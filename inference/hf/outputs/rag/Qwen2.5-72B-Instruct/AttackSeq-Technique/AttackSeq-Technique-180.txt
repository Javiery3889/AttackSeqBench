### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Infamous Chisel malware collects files based on predefined criteria and uses a Tor hidden service to exfiltrate them.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before providing SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) functionality and implementing SSH relays for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the use of a Tor hidden service for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection, which could be relevant to the malware's operations but is not directly related to the communication methods mentioned.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be used to establish persistence or to set up the necessary components for exfiltration, but it is not directly related to the communication methods mentioned.
   - **B: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for communication, which is not relevant to the use of Tor or SSH relays.
   - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-application layer protocols, which could be relevant to the use of Tor, a low-level protocol for anonymized communication.
   - **D: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:** This technique involves inhibiting system recovery, which is not directly related to the communication methods mentioned.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the use of Tor and SSH relays for communication is **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**. Tor is a low-level protocol that operates at a layer below the application layer, making it a non-application layer protocol. This technique aligns with the use of Tor for exfiltration and the implementation of SSH relays for communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
