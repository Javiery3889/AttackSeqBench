### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious Excel file gains initial access, macros are enabled to construct a PE file, and then Gholee malware uses `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe /C` for process execution while hiding its activity.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur before the `ShellExecute` command is executed.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which is consistent with the initial access via a malicious Excel file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or scripts. While it can be used to execute commands, it is not typically used in the context of constructing a PE file and then executing it via `cmd.exe /C`.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. This is a strong candidate because it aligns with the use of `cmd.exe /C` to execute the `ShellExecute` command.
   - **C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server (VPS):** This technique involves using a VPS to host malicious infrastructure. It is not directly related to the execution of commands on the victim's machine.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. It is not directly related to the execution of commands on the victim's machine.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the malicious Excel file gains initial access and macros are enabled to construct a PE file, the next step is to use a command-line interpreter to execute the `ShellExecute` command via `cmd.exe /C`.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurs before the `ShellExecute` command is executed is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
