### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Volatile Cedar group.
   - They exploited server vulnerabilities to inject web shell code.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred before they used the compromised web servers for initial access to internal networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistent access to a compromised web server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware or gain access. It is not typically used in the context of exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems and applications. It is a common precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase rather than the initial access phase.
   - **D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning:**
     - This technique involves using wordlists to perform brute-force attacks, which can be used to find weak passwords. While it can be part of the initial access phase, it is not as directly related to exploiting public-facing applications as active scanning.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1595-Active Scanning** is the most plausible technique that would occur before exploiting public-facing applications. Active scanning helps identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning
