### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Tuyul botnet maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script to ensure continued malware presence.
   - The botnet then communicates with its C2 server at the domain `irc[.]localroot[.]xyz`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - The techniques listed are:
     - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - **T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - **T1071.004-DNS**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. This is a broad category that includes various protocols.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This sub-technique specifically involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **T1071.004-DNS**: This sub-technique involves using DNS for C2 communication, which is less common but can be used to hide C2 traffic within normal DNS traffic.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question mentions that the botnet communicates with the C2 server at `irc[.]localroot[.]xyz`. This domain suggests that the communication is likely over a standard application layer protocol, specifically a web protocol (HTTP/HTTPS).
   - The use of a domain name (which is resolved via DNS) does not necessarily mean that DNS is the primary protocol for C2 communication. Instead, it is more likely that the botnet uses web protocols to communicate with the C2 server.
