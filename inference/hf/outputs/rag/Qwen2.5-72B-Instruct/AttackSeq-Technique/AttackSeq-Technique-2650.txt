### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Dridex malware gains initial access through malicious documents and macros.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur before Dridex employs anti-debugging methods using `OutputDebugStringW`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions that can help in execution, such as loading and executing payloads.
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening malicious files, which can lead to the execution of malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. While this can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the execution of the payload or the use of anti-debugging methods.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While this can occur after initial access, it is not directly related to the execution of the payload or anti-debugging.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059.002-AppleScript**
     - This technique involves using AppleScript to execute commands. This is specific to macOS and is not relevant to the context of Dridex, which is typically a Windows-based malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules to load and execute code. This is more relevant to the execution phase, where the malware might load additional components or modules to perform its tasks.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through a malicious document and macros, Dridex would likely use **T1129-Shared Modules** to load and execute additional components before employing anti-debugging methods.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
