### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Tildeb, a 32-bit console Windows executable, starts operating with command-line arguments to establish communication.
   - The focus is on the setup of a secure communication channel with encrypted traffic to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This sub-technique specifies the use of symmetric cryptography for encrypting C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise. It does not align with the setup of a secure communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic for scripting. It is not directly related to setting up secure communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically address encryption.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for C2. It is not directly related to the setup of a secure communication channel.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for setting up a secure communication channel with encrypted traffic is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**. The sub-technique **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** further specifies the use of symmetric cryptography, which aligns with the description of encrypted traffic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

However, based on the related TTPs and the specific focus on encrypted communication, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: T1573-Encrypted Channel

But since T1573 is not listed as an answer choice, the closest and most relevant answer from the provided choices is:

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
