### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the ZeroT malware:
     - It retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs using steganography.
     - It then transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography**
     - This technique involves using steganography to hide data within other files or network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography**
     - This technique also involves using steganography to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for command and control. The question does not mention any use of mail protocols, so this is not relevant.
   - **B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves using hybrid identity to gain access to resources. The question does not mention any identity-related activities, so this is not relevant.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control communications. The question mentions RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons, which aligns with this technique.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. The question does not mention any phishing activities, so this is not relevant.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of an encrypted channel to protect the command and control communications.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
