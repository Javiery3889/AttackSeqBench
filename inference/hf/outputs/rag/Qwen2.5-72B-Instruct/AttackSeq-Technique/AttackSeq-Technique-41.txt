### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after credentials are stolen from browsers like Firefox and Chrome.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred before the malware uploaded stolen keystrokes and screenshots to the C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is from the Tactic: Credential Access, and the Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers.
   - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which is the initial step in the sequence described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1491.002-External Defacement**
     - This technique involves altering the content of a website to display unauthorized information. It is not related to the sequence of stealing credentials and uploading data to a C2 server.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. While it could be used after stealing credentials, it is not directly related to the sequence of uploading stolen data to a C2 server.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the C2 infrastructure. This is a plausible step after stealing credentials and before uploading data to the C2 server.
   - **D: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it could be used to obfuscate the communication, it is not the most direct step in the sequence of uploading stolen data to a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred before the malware uploaded stolen keystrokes and screenshots to the C2 infrastructure is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
