### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation, and then conducting discovery using GitHub gists.
   - The focus is on what technique was used to ensure the SLUB backdoor remained active upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry or the Startup folder to ensure that a backdoor or malicious software runs automatically when the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves modifying or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It is not relevant to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.
   - **B: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves loading a DLL into every user-mode process, which can be used to ensure a backdoor runs at startup. However, it is less common and more complex compared to using Registry Run Keys or the Startup folder.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is not relevant to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes techniques like T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. It is highly relevant to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique to ensure the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup is **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**. This is a specific and common method for achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
