### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware uses process hollowing for defense evasion and then evades detection while executing a second-stage payload.
   - The next step in the sequence is the malware collecting information about active processes on the infected host.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Defense Evasion" and the technique is "T1055.012-Process Hollowing."
   - This confirms that the malware is using process hollowing to evade detection and execute a second-stage payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions:**
     - This technique involves adding permissions to an email account, which is not related to collecting information about active processes.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels for communication, which is not related to collecting information about active processes.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows registry, which is not directly related to collecting information about active processes.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about active processes, which aligns perfectly with the described action of the malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using process hollowing for defense evasion and evading detection while executing the second-stage payload, the malware started collecting information about active processes on the infected host using the technique T1057-Process Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery**
