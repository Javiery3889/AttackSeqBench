### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that enabled the execution of the embedded downloader macro to install the backdoor before the backdoor leveraged a shortcut in the startup folder for persistence.
   - The backdoor is installed via a macro, which suggests that the user must have executed something to trigger the macro.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic of Persistence and the technique T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder). This indicates that the backdoor uses a shortcut in the startup folder to maintain persistence, but we need to identify the technique that led to the initial execution of the macro.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique involves modifying or manipulating multi-factor authentication (MFA) to gain access. It is not relevant to the execution of a macro.
   - **B: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence or execute code. It is not directly related to the initial execution of a macro.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. It is not relevant to the initial execution of a macro.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or scripts, which is highly relevant to the scenario where a user might open a document with a macro, leading to the installation of the backdoor.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the user was tricked into executing a document with a macro, which then installed the backdoor. This aligns with the T1204 (User Execution) technique.
   - After the backdoor is installed, it uses a shortcut in the startup folder (T1547.001) to maintain persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
