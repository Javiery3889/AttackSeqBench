### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first use functions like `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` for thread context manipulation to discover process and thread information.
   - After this, the adversaries use HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate with their command and control (C2) server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the technique is "T1071.001-Web Protocols."
   - This suggests that the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols is part of the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering system and application user accounts. It is typically used in the Discovery phase to gather information about the environment.
     - This does not fit well between thread context manipulation and C2 communication, as it is more about gathering account information rather than preparing for C2 communication.
   - **B: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system configuration, installed software, and other details.
     - This also fits the Discovery phase but is not directly related to preparing for C2 communication.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This is the same as option B and does not fit well in the sequence.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server.
     - This fits well with the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols, which are application layer protocols used for C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the adversaries manipulate thread context to discover process and thread information, they then use application layer protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) to communicate with their C2 server.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred between these two steps is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
