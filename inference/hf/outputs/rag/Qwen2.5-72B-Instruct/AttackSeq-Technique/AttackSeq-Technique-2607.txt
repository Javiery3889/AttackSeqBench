### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial technique used by NanHaiShu to establish communication with the C&C servers, which initially resolved to IP addresses in the United States and later switched to a Chinese IP address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for communication with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves checking the internet connection status and details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving C&C server addresses, which aligns with the scenario of initially resolving to U.S. IP addresses and later switching to a Chinese IP address.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This is the same as Answer Choice A.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals, which is not related to establishing communication with C&C servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**. This technique fits the scenario of dynamically resolving C&C server addresses, which is necessary for the initial communication and subsequent switching of IP addresses.

**Final Answer: A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
