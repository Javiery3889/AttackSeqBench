### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where users are redirected to advertising pages or compromised sites that execute RIG exploits via malvertising.
   - After the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) runs an obfuscated PowerShell script, it fetches malware from the Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising:** This technique involves using malicious advertisements to redirect users to exploit kits or other malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, often for malicious purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1648-Serverless Execution:** This technique involves executing code in a serverless environment, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - **B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code. While this could be part of the initial exploitation, the question specifically asks about what happens after the RIG EK runs the PowerShell script.
   - **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities:** This technique involves acquiring tools, malware, or other capabilities to support the attack. This could be relevant to the initial stages of the attack but not specifically to the sequence after the PowerShell script runs.
   - **D: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute code. This could be a plausible next step after the PowerShell script fetches malware, as the malware might use DLL side-loading to execute.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the RIG EK runs the obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure, the malware might use DLL side-loading to execute. This aligns with the described sequence of events and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
