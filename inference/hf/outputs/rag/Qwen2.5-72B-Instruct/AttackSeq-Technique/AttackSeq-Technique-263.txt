### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to trick users into interacting with malicious email attachments or downloaded files from websites or peer-to-peer networks.
   - The goal is to identify the initial step that leads to the execution of RATs (Remote Access Trojans) in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the scenario of users interacting with email attachments or downloaded files.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols for command and control, which is a later stage in the attack sequence and not relevant to the initial user interaction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is not related to tricking users into interacting with malicious files.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into opening attachments or clicking on links, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - **C: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into running processes, which is a method used to execute malware in memory but does not involve the initial user interaction.
   - **D: T1585-Establish Accounts:** This technique involves creating or modifying accounts, which is not related to tricking users into interacting with malicious files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **B: T1566-Phishing**. Phishing is the technique used to trick users into interacting with malicious email attachments or downloaded files, which can then lead to the execution of RATs in memory.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
