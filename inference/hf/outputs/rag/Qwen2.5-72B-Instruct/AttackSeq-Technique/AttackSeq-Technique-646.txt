### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker bypasses environment-based checks, such as a CPU core check, to detect virtualization. This is a common technique used to avoid detection in sandboxed or virtualized environments.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure that the implanted Remote Access Tool (RAT) can execute upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves the attacker checking the system environment to determine if it is running in a virtualized or sandboxed environment.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique is used to evade detection by checking the system environment and avoiding execution if it detects a virtualized or sandboxed environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) to redirect traffic and relay authentication requests. This is not related to ensuring the RAT executes upon system startup.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the RAT or other malicious code runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is directly related to the question's requirement.
   - **C: T1608-Stage Capabilities:** This technique involves preparing and organizing the necessary components for the attack, such as downloading additional tools or payloads. While this is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not specifically address the requirement of ensuring the RAT executes upon system startup.
   - **D: T1542.003-Bootkit:** This technique involves installing a bootkit, which is a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a hard drive to gain early control of the system. While this can ensure the RAT executes early in the boot process, it is a more advanced and specific technique that is not typically the next step after bypassing environment checks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after bypassing environment-based checks, the attacker would use a technique to ensure the RAT executes upon system startup. The technique that best fits this requirement is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
