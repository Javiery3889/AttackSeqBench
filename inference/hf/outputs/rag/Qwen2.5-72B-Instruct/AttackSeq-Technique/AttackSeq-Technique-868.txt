### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by GreyEnergy's operators: they used spearphishing and the compromise of servers as initial infection vectors.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they attempted lateral movement to other workstations within the targeted organization's network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems.
   - **T1534 - Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails to internal users to gain access to additional systems.
   - **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. However, the question already mentions that the initial infection vectors were spearphishing and server compromise, not public-facing applications.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564 - Hide Artifacts:**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While this could be relevant, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions leading to lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1217 - Browser Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering information from the browser, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions leading to lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising the supply chain to gain access to systems. However, the question already mentions spearphishing and server compromise as the initial infection vectors, not supply chain compromise.

4. **Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through spearphishing and server compromise, the operators would likely use **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer** to transfer tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise

However, based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is actually **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer**. Since this is not one of the provided answer choices, the closest and most relevant answer is:

Final Answer: **D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** (Note: This is the closest match, but T1570 would be the most accurate if it were an option.)
