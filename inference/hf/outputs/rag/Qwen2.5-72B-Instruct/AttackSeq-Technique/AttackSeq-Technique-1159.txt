### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after PROMETHIUM used a document search module to locate and parse files in preparation for exfiltration to the C2 server.
   - The key points are:
     - Document search and parsing.
     - Preparation for exfiltration.
     - Exfiltration to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves automatically sending data to an external location.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending data to a command and control (C2) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target. It does not fit the context of document search and exfiltration.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves using automated tools to collect data. While it is related to data collection, it does not specifically address the exfiltration step.
   - **C: T1569-System Services:**
     - This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It does not fit the context of exfiltration.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration. This fits well with the context of preparing data for exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after PROMETHIUM locates and parses the files, it would archive the collected data (T1560) to prepare it for exfiltration. This is followed by the actual exfiltration techniques (T1020 and T1041).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1560-Archive Collected Data
