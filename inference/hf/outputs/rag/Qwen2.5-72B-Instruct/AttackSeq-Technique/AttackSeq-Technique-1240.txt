### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where WinDealer malware targets Chinese-speaking users and uses legitimate download mechanisms.
   - The malware maintains communication with randomly generated machines over specific IP ranges within AS4134.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** (Tactic: Defense Evasion): This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system or application components to avoid detection.
   - **T1102.003-One-Way Communication** (Tactic: Command and Control): This technique involves the use of one-way communication channels to send data from the compromised system to the attacker, often without receiving commands back.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**:
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to evade detection. While it could be used for command and control, it doesn't specifically align with the description of maintaining communication with randomly generated machines over specific IP ranges.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**:
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. It is more related to persistence rather than maintaining communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**:
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding methods to obfuscate data. It is more about data exfiltration and not about maintaining communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1074-Data Staged**:
     - This technique involves collecting and preparing data for exfiltration. It is more about the preparation phase rather than maintaining communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique based on the related TTPs and the question is **T1102.003-One-Way Communication**. This technique aligns with the description of maintaining communication with randomly generated machines over specific IP ranges, which is a form of command and control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication
