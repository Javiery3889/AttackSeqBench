### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Regin:
     - Gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic.
     - Contributed to its discovery capabilities.
     - Captured credentials by analyzing network traffic.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:**
     - This technique involves preventing the detection of malicious activities by blocking indicators.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1560.002-Archive via Library:**
     - This technique involves compressing data to reduce its size or to prepare it for exfiltration. It does not fit well between gathering information and capturing credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1040-Network Sniffing:**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic, which aligns with the description of monitoring network traffic and capturing credentials. It fits well in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process. While it is related to credential capture, it is more specific and does not fit the broader context of monitoring network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering active network connections, which is part of the discovery phase but does not directly involve capturing credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred after gathering information and before capturing credentials is **T1040-Network Sniffing**.

**Final Answer: B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
