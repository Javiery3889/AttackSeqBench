### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the malware gathered system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings during the Discovery phase.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware has already performed Discovery.
     - It has gathered system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1560.002-Archive via Library:**
     - This technique involves compressing data to prepare it for exfiltration. It is typically used after data has been collected.
   - **B: T1114-Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's email client or server. It is a form of data collection.
   - **C: T1578.003-Delete Cloud Instance:**
     - This technique involves deleting cloud instances, which is not typically a next step after data collection.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is typically used in the initial stages of an attack, not after data has been collected.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the malware has already gathered system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings, the next logical step would be to collect more specific data, such as emails, which can be valuable for further exploitation or exfiltration.
   - **T1114-Email Collection** fits this context well, as it is a natural progression from the Discovery phase to the Collection phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1114-Email Collection
