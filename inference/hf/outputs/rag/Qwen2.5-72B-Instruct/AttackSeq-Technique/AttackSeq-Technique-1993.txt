### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy encoded data and exfiltrated it to its C2 server via a structured HTTP POST request.
   - The key actions here are "encoded data" and "exfiltrated it to its C2 server."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable during exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1036.009-Break Process Trees:** This technique involves manipulating process trees to hide the presence of malicious processes. It is not directly related to data encoding or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to data encoding or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable. This aligns with the action of encoding data before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automatically collecting data from the victim's system. While it is a step in the attack chain, it does not directly relate to the encoding and exfiltration actions described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that data was encoded (T1132) before it was exfiltrated to the C2 server (T1041).

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
