### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Pierogi backdoor is executed via an embedded macro in a Microsoft Word document.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to ensure the backdoor runs upon user login.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial step of downloading and running the backdoor via an embedded macro.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the backdoor runs automatically when the user logs in or the system boots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a Terminal Services process, which is not directly related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the backdoor runs automatically when the user logs in or the system boots, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves sending data to a web service, which is not related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.
   - **D: T1098.005-Device Registration**: This technique involves registering a device with a service, which is not related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor would use a technique to ensure it runs upon user login, which is covered by T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
