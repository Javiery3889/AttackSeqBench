### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Elise malware initiates queries to ipaddress.com to obtain WAN IP addresses.
   - It then leverages system network configuration details to further its profiling activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Discovery" and the technique is "T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1087.003-Email Account**
     - This technique involves discovering email accounts, which is not directly related to network configuration or IP address discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is not related to the discovery of network configuration details.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails to internal users, which is not related to network configuration or IP address discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering system network configuration details, which aligns perfectly with the described activity of the Elise malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
