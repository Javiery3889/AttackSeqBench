### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a macOS attack sequence where ChromeLoader gained initial access through a DMG containing a shell script.
   - The attacker then established persistence with a Chrome browser extension.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions**: This technique involves using browser extensions to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves gaining initial access through a drive-by compromise, which could involve a user downloading a malicious file.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.002-AppleScript**: This technique involves executing AppleScript to run commands on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1176-Browser Extensions**: This technique is related to persistence, which is the final step in the sequence described. It is not likely to occur between gaining initial access and establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**: This technique is related to persistence and involves modifying the LSASS driver. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to maintain command and control (C2) or exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure to gain access, which is more related to initial access rather than the steps between initial access and persistence.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described is:
     1. Initial Access: ChromeLoader gains access through a DMG containing a shell script.
     2. **Execution**: The shell script is executed to perform some actions.
     3. Persistence: The attacker establishes persistence with a Chrome browser extension.
   - The most plausible technique that fits between initial access and persistence is **T1059.002-AppleScript**, as it involves executing the shell script to perform necessary actions before setting up persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1059.002-AppleScript**
