### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Earth Lusca used WinRAR to compress files and the megacmd tool to upload the archive to the Mega service for exfiltration.
   - The focus is on the communication method used to avoid detection during this exfiltration process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves using utilities to compress files, which aligns with the use of WinRAR.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which aligns with the use of the megacmd tool to upload the archive to Mega.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports to communicate, which can help avoid detection by network monitoring tools. This is a plausible method to avoid detection during exfiltration.
   - **B: T1137.002-Office Test:** This technique involves using Office applications to test and validate malicious code, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process described.
   - **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the communication or exfiltration process described.
   - **D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media for communication, which is not relevant to the described use of cloud storage for exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for avoiding detection during the exfiltration process, given the context of using cloud storage, is **T1571-Non-Standard Port**. Using non-standard ports can help evade network monitoring and detection mechanisms, making it a suitable choice for the described scenario.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port
