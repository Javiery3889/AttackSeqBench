### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers avoided writing the RAT payload to disk (fileless storage) and then connected to their control server (command and control).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique involves keeping the payload in memory to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing the macOS Gatekeeper security feature. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it could be a method to deliver the payload, it is not the most likely step immediately before connecting to the control server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation:** This technique involves manipulating the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) database on macOS to gain access to protected resources. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice E: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring the RAT payload into the compromised environment, which aligns with the sequence described in the question. After the payload is transferred, it can be kept in memory (fileless storage) and then used to connect to the control server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
