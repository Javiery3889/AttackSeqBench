### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the actors used `systeminfo.exe` and `net.exe` to gather system and network-related information during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is lateral movement to the Domain Controller using `wmic.exe`.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two phases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the use of `systeminfo.exe`.
   - **T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):** This technique involves using WMI for execution, which can be used for various purposes, including lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes, which is a form of discovery but not necessarily a step that would directly lead to lateral movement.
   - **B: T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This technique involves discovering cloud account information, which is not relevant to the on-premises system and network discovery described in the question.
   - **C: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery:** This technique involves identifying permission groups and their members, which is a logical step after gathering system and network information and before attempting lateral movement. Understanding permission groups can help in identifying potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is more related to persistence or execution rather than a step in the discovery phase leading to lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurred after the initial discovery using `systeminfo.exe` and `net.exe` and before lateral movement using `wmic.exe` is **T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**
