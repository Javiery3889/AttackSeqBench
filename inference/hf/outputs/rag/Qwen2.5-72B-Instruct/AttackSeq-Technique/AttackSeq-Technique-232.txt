### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitated the delivery of malicious documents to victim organizations before the threat actor group executed a multi-step process using batch files to decode and deploy additional malicious payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves the use of a command shell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to decode and deploy additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using add-ins to execute malicious code. While it can be used to deliver malware, it is less common for initial delivery compared to other methods.
   - **B: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain to deliver malware. This is a sophisticated and less common method for initial delivery.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. It is typically used after initial access has been gained, not for the initial delivery of malware.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to trick users into opening malicious documents or links. Phishing is a common and effective method for initial delivery of malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would start with the initial delivery of the malicious documents via phishing, followed by the user opening the malicious file (T1204.002), and then the execution of the batch files using a Windows command shell (T1059.003).

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
