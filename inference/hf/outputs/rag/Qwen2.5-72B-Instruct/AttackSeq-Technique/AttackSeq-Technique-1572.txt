### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Turla used PowerShell to run malware directly in memory and before encrypting payloads to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading a portable executable (PE) file directly into memory without touching the disk, which is a common method to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to run malware directly in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1546-Event Triggered Execution:** This technique involves modifying or creating system event triggers to execute malicious code. This is typically used for persistence and not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure:** This technique involves altering cloud resources, which is not relevant to the in-memory execution and evasion described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1137-Office Application Startup:** This technique involves using Office applications to execute code at startup, which is also more related to persistence and not directly relevant to the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating connected devices, which is not directly related to the in-memory execution and evasion described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves using PowerShell to run malware directly in memory (T1059.001) and then encrypting payloads to evade detection. The most plausible technique that fits between these two steps is **T1620-Reflective Code Loading**. This technique is used to load malware directly into memory, which aligns with the in-memory execution and evasion described.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
