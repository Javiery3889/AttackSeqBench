### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control (C2) server accessed via SMB to execute additional PowerShell scripts. The next step in the sequence is to determine how the exfiltrated data is transferred out of the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique involves the use of legitimate cloud accounts to gain access to systems. While it might be used in the initial stages of an attack, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This technique involves setting up scheduled transfers of data. While it could be used for exfiltration, it does not specifically align with the use of a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data from cloud storage services. While it is related to cloud storage, it does not specifically mention the use of a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. Given that the attacker is using Microsoft OneDrive as a C2 server, this technique aligns perfectly with the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the exfiltrated data is transferred out of the network using the same C2 channel (Microsoft OneDrive).

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
