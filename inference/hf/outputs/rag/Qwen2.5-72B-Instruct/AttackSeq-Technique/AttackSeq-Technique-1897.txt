### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker collects data from network shared drives, archives it, and then targets web-accessible directories to steal the staged data.
   - The focus is on the final step of stealing the staged data from web-accessible directories.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves moving collected data to a location that can be accessed by the attacker, such as a web-accessible directory.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, which is the ultimate goal of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using web services, which aligns with the scenario of targeting web-accessible directories to steal the staged data.
   - **B: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input from graphical user interfaces, which is not relevant to the described scenario.
   - **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of staged data.
   - **D: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using USB devices, which is not relevant to the scenario of web-accessible directories.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is the exfiltration of data over a web service, which aligns with the final step of targeting web-accessible directories to steal the staged data.

**Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
