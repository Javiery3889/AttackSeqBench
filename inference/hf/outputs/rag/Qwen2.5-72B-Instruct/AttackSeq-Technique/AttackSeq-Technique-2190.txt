### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance using tools like PowerSploit.
   - The sequence ends with the execution of malicious code through a fake system update service.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred in between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While phishing can be a method to gain initial access, it doesn't fit well in the context of the sequence described, which starts with reconnaissance and ends with lateral movement.
   - **B: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools:** This technique involves removing indicators from tools to avoid detection. This is more relevant to post-exploitation activities and doesn't fit well in the sequence between reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a network. This fits well in the sequence as it could be a step taken after discovering remote systems and before executing malicious code.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection. While it can be used during various stages of an attack, it doesn't fit well in the sequence between reconnaissance and lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred after reconnaissance and before the execution of malicious code is **T1133-External Remote Services**.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
