### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the NanHaiShu malware.
   - It establishes persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.
   - It then communicates with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers.
   - We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that occurs between these two actions for gathering specific system details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the registry to gather information about the system.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying registry run keys or startup folders to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, which is not relevant to gathering system details.
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves discovering domain trust relationships, which is not relevant to gathering general system details.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves achieving persistence, which is already mentioned in the question (modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry).
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, which fits the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after establishing persistence, the malware would gather system information before communicating with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
