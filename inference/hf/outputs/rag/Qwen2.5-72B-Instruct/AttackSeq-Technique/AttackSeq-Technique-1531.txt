### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Lazarus Group retrieved the username, computer name, and a list of all running processes using the 'GetBaseInfo.dll' module.
   - The key information here is that the group has already performed discovery of the system and processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system, which aligns with the retrieval of a list of all running processes.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system's owner and user, which aligns with the retrieval of the username and computer name.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. It is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain initial access, not after discovery.
   - **B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up scheduled data transfers, which is more relevant to exfiltration or command and control activities, not immediately after discovery.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common network protocols to communicate with a remote system. It is often used for command and control or data exfiltration, which could logically follow after discovery.
   - **D: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the attacker's location and communication. It is more relevant to command and control activities, which could also follow after discovery.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the Lazarus Group has already performed discovery (T1057 and T1033), the next logical step would be to establish communication with a remote system to exfiltrate data or receive further commands.
   - Both T1071 and T1090.003 are relevant to this next step, but T1071 is more general and commonly used for both command and control and data exfiltration, making it a more likely choice.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
