### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the SombRAT backdoor archives collected data in a custom storage file format.
   - The next step in the sequence is to transfer the data from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial step of gathering data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves archiving the collected data using a custom method, which matches the description of the SombRAT backdoor archiving the data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for transferring data from a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using a USB device. While this is a valid method, it is less likely in the context of a backdoor that typically uses network-based methods for data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules, which is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves manipulating domain properties, which is not related to data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a common and logical next step after archiving the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data is exfiltrated over a C2 channel after being archived.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
