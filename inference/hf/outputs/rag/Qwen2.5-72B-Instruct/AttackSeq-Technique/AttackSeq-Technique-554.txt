### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where MuddyWater attackers used open-source tools like Meterpreter and Mimikatz to evade defenses.
   - The focus is on the technique used to facilitate communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic between the attacker and the compromised system, often to obfuscate the origin of the traffic or to bypass network defenses.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear benign to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool:** This technique involves the use of open-source tools like Meterpreter and Mimikatz to support the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to blend in with normal traffic, but it does not specifically mention the use of domains and proxy URLs.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves hiding files or directories to evade detection, which is not related to communication with compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with the compromised system, but it does not specifically mention the use of domains and proxy URLs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1548.004-Elevated Execution with Prompt:** This technique involves gaining elevated privileges, which is not related to communication with compromised systems.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique based on the related TTPs and the question is **T1090-Proxy**. This technique is specifically about using a proxy to route traffic, which aligns with the use of domains and proxy URLs to facilitate communication with compromised systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**

However, based on the related TTPs and the specific mention of domains and proxy URLs, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1090-Proxy** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant technique based on the context.) 

Given the provided choices, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
