### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before the malicious app was distributed via a website disguised as a charity site to gain initial access to victims' devices.
   - The context is about gaining initial access, which is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary compromising a website and causing a victim's system to automatically execute malicious code when the victim visits the site.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a spearphishing message with a link to a malicious website or file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites:** This technique involves searching for and identifying websites owned by the victim. While this could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not directly related to the distribution of a malicious app via a charity site.
   - **B: T1583.004-Server:** This technique involves setting up a server to host malicious content. While this could be part of the infrastructure setup, it is not the initial step in gaining access.
   - **C: T1593.003-Code Repositories:** This technique involves using code repositories to host malicious content. This is not directly related to the distribution via a charity site.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending phishing messages to victims. The specific sub-technique **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** is closely related to the context of the question, as it involves sending a link to a malicious website, which could be the charity site in question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary used **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** to send a link to the charity site, which then led to the drive-by compromise (T1189) when the victim visited the site.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
