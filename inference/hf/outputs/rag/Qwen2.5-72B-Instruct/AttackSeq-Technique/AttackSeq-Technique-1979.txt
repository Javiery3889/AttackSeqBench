### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs in a ransomware attack.
   - The attack starts with exploiting vulnerabilities in VPNs and remote desktop protocols during reconnaissance.
   - The final steps are data exfiltration and encrypting victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, which is a common step in ransomware attacks.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which aligns with the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities in VPNs and remote desktop protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While it can be used for initial access, it is not typically the next step after exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
   - **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools:** This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager:** This technique involves stealing credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. This could be a plausible step after gaining initial access, as attackers often need to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering identity information, which is not typically a step in the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications (T1190).
     2. **Credential Access:** Steal credentials from the Windows Credential Manager (T1555.004) to escalate privileges or move laterally.
     3. **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate data.
     4. **Impact:** Encrypt victim systems (T1486).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager
