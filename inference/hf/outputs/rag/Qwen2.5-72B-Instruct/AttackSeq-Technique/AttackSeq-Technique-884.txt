### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Rocra attackers:
     - Initial access via spear-phishing and exploiting known vulnerabilities.
     - Establishing a sophisticated C&C infrastructure.
     - Lateral movement within the local area network.
   - The focus is on the technique used to infect remote hosts during lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data:**
     - This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not relevant to lateral movement or infecting remote hosts.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique is directly related to lateral movement and involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems. This aligns well with the context of infecting remote hosts.
   - **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:**
     - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate to remote systems, which is a method of lateral movement but is more specific to credential-based access.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems, which is also a method of lateral movement but is more about using existing credentials rather than exploiting vulnerabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique used to infect remote hosts during lateral movement is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
