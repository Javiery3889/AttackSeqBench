### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Tildeb uses encrypted communication with its C&C server via a modified SHA-1 hashing algorithm to establish session keys.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Command and Control phase to deploy additional tools for malicious activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This sub-technique involves using symmetric cryptography for C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate domain accounts to gain access to systems. While this could be part of the initial access or persistence phase, it is not directly related to deploying additional tools for malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools, such as additional malware or other files, into the target network. This is a common step before establishing a C2 channel to ensure the attacker has the necessary tools for further activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to evade detection. While this is a defense evasion technique, it is not directly related to deploying additional tools.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the compromised system. While this is related to C2, it is more about the complexity of the communication rather than the deployment of tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker would first transfer additional tools into the target network before establishing the encrypted C2 channel. This aligns with the technique T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Final Answer: B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
