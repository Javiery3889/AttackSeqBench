### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FamousSparrow exfiltrated data after SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different, asymmetrically encrypted protocol that is not the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique aligns well with the scenario described. Since SparrowDoor is already communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS, it is plausible that the exfiltration of data would occur over the same channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into processes, which is not related to exfiltration. It is not relevant to the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering security software on the target system, which is not related to exfiltration. It is not relevant to the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This is the same as Answer Choice A and is also a plausible choice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both Answer Choices A and D are the same and align with the scenario described in the question. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
