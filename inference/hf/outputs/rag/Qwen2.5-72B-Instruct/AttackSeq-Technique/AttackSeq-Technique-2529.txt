### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where BlueDelta exfiltrated data by automating the process.
   - Before the exfiltration, the attacker collected emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward incoming emails to an attacker-controlled email address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1114 - Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails from a victim's email account.
   - **T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:** This sub-technique involves collecting emails from the local email client or server.
   - **T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:** This sub-technique involves setting up rules to forward emails to an attacker-controlled email address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves hiding the nature of the data to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the collection or forwarding of emails.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data. This is a plausible next step after collecting and forwarding emails.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1048.002 - Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over an encrypted protocol that is not part of the command and control (C2) channel. This is also a plausible next step after collecting and forwarding emails.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1543.004 - Launch Daemon:** This technique involves creating or modifying a launch daemon to achieve persistence. This is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of emails.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:** Setting up a rule to forward emails to an attacker-controlled email address.
     2. **T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:** Automating the process of exfiltrating the collected emails.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
