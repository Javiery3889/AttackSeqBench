### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the malware established persistence by creating a registry key and before securely communicating with the C2 server via SSL/TLS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to secure communication with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves creating registry keys or placing files in the startup folder to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1137.003-Outlook Forms:** This technique involves using Outlook forms to execute code. It is not directly related to the sequence of establishing persistence and securing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is already mentioned in the related TTPs. This technique is about establishing persistence, which is already part of the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it. While it could be used in the communication process, it is not specifically about securing the communication with SSL/TLS.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090.004-Domain Fronting:** This technique involves using domain fronting to mask the true destination of the C2 traffic. It is a method of evading detection but is not directly related to securing the communication with SSL/TLS.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves establishing persistence and then securing communication with the C2 server. The most plausible technique that fits between these two steps is **T1132-Data Encoding**. Encoding the data before sending it over SSL/TLS can help in obfuscating the content and making it harder to detect.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
