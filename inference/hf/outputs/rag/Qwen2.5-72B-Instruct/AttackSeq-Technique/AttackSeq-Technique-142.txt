### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability via malicious HWP files.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to simplify malicious EPS file code for better evasion from detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear legitimate to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's inbox. It does not align with the context of simplifying malicious EPS file code for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves intercepting the execution of a program by exploiting unquoted paths. It is not directly related to simplifying malicious code for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to gain elevated privileges. It is not related to simplifying malicious code for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This aligns with the context of simplifying malicious EPS file code for better evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of simplifying malicious EPS file code for better evasion, is **T1070-Indicator Removal**.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
