### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the use of DNS for Command and Control (C2) communication.
   - The context is that a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) has already keylogged and stolen Outlook passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using the DNS protocol for C2 communication.
   - **T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.015-ListPlanting:** This technique involves creating a list of processes to be terminated or started. It is not directly related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's system. While it can be used for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to C2 communication.
   - **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols, which could include DNS. This is a plausible step before using DNS for C2 communication.
   - **D: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video from the victim's system. Like screen capture, it is more for reconnaissance and not directly related to C2 communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after keylogging and stealing Outlook passwords, the attacker would exfiltrate the stolen data using an alternative protocol (such as DNS) before setting up DNS for C2 communication.
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** fits this sequence well, as it involves exfiltrating data using protocols like DNS, which aligns with the subsequent use of DNS for C2 communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
