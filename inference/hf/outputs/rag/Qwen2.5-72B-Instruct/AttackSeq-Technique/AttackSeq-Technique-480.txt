### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Trickbot:
     - Uses a PoS extraction module to gather domain-specific PoS-related terms.
     - Intercepts traffic with a proxy module.
     - Connects to a URL and processes its payload for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking browser sessions to collect information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:**
     - Phishing involves tricking users into providing sensitive information. This does not align with the described sequence of actions, which focuses on malware execution and traffic interception.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While the question mentions a proxy module, this is not the final step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:**
     - ARP Cache Poisoning involves manipulating the ARP table to intercept traffic. This is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system. This aligns with the final step of connecting to a URL and processing the payload for execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
