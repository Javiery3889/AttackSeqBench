### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan has leveraged its capabilities to move laterally through the network using manual methods and USB infection.
   - The key points are:
     - Lateral movement using manual methods.
     - Lateral movement using USB infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
   - These TTPs confirm that the Trojan used USB infection (T1091) for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. It is not directly related to lateral movement or USB infection.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather credentials. While it can be used post-lateral movement, it is not a direct next step after USB infection.
   - **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
     - This technique involves using stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate as a user without a password. It is a common post-lateral movement technique, especially in environments where Kerberos is used.
   - **D: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not directly related to lateral movement or USB infection.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the Trojan has already moved laterally using USB infection, the next logical step would be to maintain and extend access within the network. **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket** is a common technique used to maintain access and move further within the network by using stolen Kerberos tickets.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket
