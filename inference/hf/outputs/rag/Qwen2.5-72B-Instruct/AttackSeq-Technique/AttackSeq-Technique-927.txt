### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Volatile Cedar uses keylogging to gain credentials and then connects to a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, such as credentials.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This is a repetition of the keylogging technique, emphasizing its importance in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. While this could be a method to gain initial access, it does not fit the context of connecting to a multi-tiered server backend after keylogging.
   - **B: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions. It does not align with the context of connecting to a backend framework.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less recognizable. While it could be used to hide the keylogged data, it does not fit the context of connecting to a backend framework.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with the command and control server. This aligns well with the context of connecting to a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of keylogging and connecting to a multi-tiered server backend, is the use of application layer protocols to communicate with the command and control server.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
