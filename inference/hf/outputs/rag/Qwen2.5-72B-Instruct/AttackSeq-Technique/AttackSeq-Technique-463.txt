### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying tools, malware, or capabilities. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs before the actual initial access and is not directly related to the specific method of gaining initial access (spear phishing).
   - **Answer Choice B: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to gain access to a network. This is not relevant to the spear phishing method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and network configuration. This typically occurs after gaining initial access, not before.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. The specific sub-technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is directly mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the method described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the spear phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word document (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) was used to gain initial access. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before this initial access is the broader category of phishing (T1566).

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
