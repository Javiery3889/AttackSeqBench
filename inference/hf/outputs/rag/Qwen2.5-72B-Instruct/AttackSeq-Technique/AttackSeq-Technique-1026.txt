### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a backdoor takes screenshots every minute, and then sensitive data from removable drives is harvested and uploaded to a C&C server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the data from removable drives was uploaded to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, etc.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data to a remote location.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is not directly related to removable media.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space:** This technique is related to keylogging and reducing the key space for brute-force attacks. It does not fit the context of collecting data from removable media.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. While this is part of the exfiltration process, it is not the step that occurs before collecting data from removable media.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals. It is not related to collecting data from removable media.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique directly involves collecting data from removable media, which fits the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data from removable media (T1025) was collected before it was exfiltrated to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
