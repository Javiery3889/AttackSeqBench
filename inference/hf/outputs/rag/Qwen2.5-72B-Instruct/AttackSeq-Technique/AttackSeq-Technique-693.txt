### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Pierogi backdoor communicated with predefined URLs for receiving commands and sending machine information.
   - This implies that the backdoor has already established a command and control (C2) channel and is now receiving commands and exfiltrating data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication between the backdoor and the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker's server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1205.001-Port Knocking:**
     - Port knocking is a method of opening ports on a firewall by sending a sequence of connection attempts to a set of closed ports. This is typically used to initiate a connection, not to receive commands or exfiltrate data.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 infrastructure. While it could be used for C2, it is not specifically about receiving commands or exfiltrating data.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses:**
     - This technique involves degrading or disabling security controls on the victim's system. It is not directly related to the communication or exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the parent process ID to hide the true parent process of a malicious process. It is not related to C2 or data exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the backdoor has already established a C2 channel and is receiving commands and exfiltrating data, the most relevant technique is **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**. This technique aligns with the scenario where the backdoor is sending machine information to the attacker's server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service

However, based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

But since T1020 is not listed as an answer choice, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
