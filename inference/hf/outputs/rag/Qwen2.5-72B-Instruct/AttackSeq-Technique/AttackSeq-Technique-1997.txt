### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where data is exfiltrated using a POST request to a C2 server.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to enumerate files and directories across the targeted system, including Desktop and user-specific folders.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the initial part of the question where data is exfiltrated using a POST request.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries enumerating files and directories on a system, which is the focus of the second part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: This technique involves manipulating the system path to execute malicious code, which is not related to file and directory enumeration.
   - **B: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves discovering connected peripheral devices, which is not related to file and directory enumeration.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique directly involves enumerating files and directories on a system, which matches the requirement of the question.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, but it is not specifically about file and directory enumeration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific requirement to enumerate files and directories, the most plausible answer is **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
