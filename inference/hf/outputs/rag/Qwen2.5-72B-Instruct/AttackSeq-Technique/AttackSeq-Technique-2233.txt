### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Grabit malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server to download itself via a malicious macro.
   - The focus is on the technique used to maintain persistence on the infected system after the initial download.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task (Persistence):** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Exfiltration):** This technique involves sending data to a remote system over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Persistence):** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute malicious code when the system boots or a user logs on.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted. This is not related to maintaining persistence.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute malicious code when the system boots or a user logs on, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1546.011-Application Shimming:** This technique involves using application shimming to execute malicious code, but it is not typically used for maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association:** This technique involves changing file associations to execute malicious code when a specific file type is opened, but it is not a common method for maintaining persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining persistence, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**. This technique aligns with the goal of ensuring the malware runs every time the system boots or a user logs on.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
