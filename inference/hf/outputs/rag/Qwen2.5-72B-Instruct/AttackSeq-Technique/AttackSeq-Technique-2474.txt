### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.
   - The attack sequence involves exfiltrating stolen credentials to an FTP server using legitimate tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:** This technique involves signing malicious code to appear legitimate.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for command and control (C2).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is not directly related to evading detection or using legitimate tools.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear legitimate by using names or locations that are similar to legitimate ones. This can help evade detection.
   - **C: T1053.002-At:** This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command, which is a legitimate tool. However, it is not specifically about evading detection.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate accounts to gain access to systems, which can help evade detection but is not about using legitimate tools to evade behavior-based detectors.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique that enables the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors is **T1036-Masquerading**. This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear legitimate, which aligns with the context of using legitimate tools to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading
