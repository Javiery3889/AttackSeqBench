### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before the exfiltration of collected data to the C&C server.
   - The context is that the attacker has already scanned all drives, including network shares and removable drives, for sensitive documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of collected data to a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen. It is not directly related to the collection of data from drives or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails from the local system. While it is a collection technique, it is specific to emails and not general data from drives.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. It is a general technique that can be used for various purposes but is not specifically related to data collection or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the search order to intercept and execute malicious code. It is not directly related to data collection or exfiltration.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the attacker has already scanned all drives for sensitive documents, the most relevant technique that would occur before exfiltration is the collection of data from the local system and network shared drives.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** and **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** are the most relevant techniques for this context.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1106-Native API**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the related TTPs and the context of the question is:

Final Answer: **B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**

This is because the question specifically mentions the collection of sensitive documents, and email collection is a form of data collection that could be part of the broader data collection process before exfiltration. However, if the focus is strictly on the collection of data from drives, then **T1005-Data from Local System** would be the most appropriate choice. 

Given the options provided, **B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection** is the most plausible answer.
