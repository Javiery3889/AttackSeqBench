### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Rocket Kitten utilized hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests from GHOLE malware as part of their C&C communication.
   - The key elements here are "hard-coded IP addresses," "GET requests," and "C&C communication."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves hiding the true nature of files or information to evade detection. While this could be part of the malware's overall strategy, it is not directly related to the C&C communication described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using external proxies to route C&C traffic. While this could be a method to obfuscate the C&C communication, it is not the most direct next step after using hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. This is not directly related to the C&C communication described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C&C communication. Given that the question mentions GET requests, which are part of the HTTP protocol, this is the most relevant and direct next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of application layer protocols for C&C communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
