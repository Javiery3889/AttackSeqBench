### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Delphi downloader gathers system information and sends it to a C&C server.
   - The focus is on securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric encryption to secure communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. It is not related to securing communication between a backdoor and a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to secure communication. The related TTP T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography specifically mentions using symmetric encryption, which aligns with securing communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS for communication. While it can be used for C&C, it does not specifically address securing the communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate processes. It is not related to securing communication between a backdoor and a C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the focus on securing communication, the most plausible answer is **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
