### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through spear-phishing documents or watering hole attacks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Dropping Elephant backdoor executed encoded blobs to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to reveal their true content. This is a common step in the execution of encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**
     - This technique involves using file transfer protocols to transfer files. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the execution of encoded blobs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**
     - This technique involves smuggling malicious content within HTML files. While this could be used to deliver the initial payload, it is not directly related to the execution of encoded blobs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate. While this could be used for command and control, it is not directly related to the execution of encoded blobs.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing or a watering hole attack, the attacker would need to deobfuscate or decode the encoded blobs to execute the Dropping Elephant backdoor. This aligns with the technique T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
