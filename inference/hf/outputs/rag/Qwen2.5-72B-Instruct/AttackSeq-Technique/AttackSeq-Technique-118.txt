### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - Key points: 
     - Achieved persistence.
     - Deployed 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
     - Ensured command execution.
     - Minimized detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.003-Windows Service (Persistence, Privilege Escalation):** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence and privilege escalation.
   - **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary (Persistence):** This technique involves modifying a legitimate host software binary to include malicious functionality, which can help in maintaining persistence and evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using legitimate remote services to execute commands on a remote system. While it can be used for command execution, it does not directly address minimizing detection.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to evade detection. This aligns well with the goal of minimizing detection.
   - **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process to execute commands. While it can be used for command execution, it is more specific to process injection and does not directly address minimizing detection.
   - **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution:** This technique involves using indirect methods to execute commands, which can help in evading detection. However, it is not as directly related to the context of the question as T1070.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal** is the most plausible choice because it directly addresses the goal of minimizing detection, which is a key requirement in the question. After achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, removing indicators of compromise would be a logical step to ensure the backdoor remains undetected.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal
