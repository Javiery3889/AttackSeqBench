### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where TG1021 uses compromised domain credentials to access shared folders and drop a web shell loader via SMB to compromise additional servers.
   - We need to determine the next ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after this sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts (Tactic: Initial Access):** This technique involves using valid domain credentials to gain initial access to a network.
   - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares (Tactic: Lateral Movement):** This technique involves using SMB to move laterally within a network.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer (Tactic: Lateral Movement):** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves abusing mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. It is not directly related to the lateral movement or the use of SMB to drop a web shell.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using DCOM for remote code execution. While it is a lateral movement technique, it is not the most likely next step after using SMB to drop a web shell.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
     - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. It is not directly related to the lateral movement or the use of SMB to drop a web shell.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access or execute code. Given that the web shell loader has been dropped via SMB, the next logical step would be to exploit the remote service (e.g., the web server) to gain further access or execute additional payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after using compromised domain credentials to access shared folders and drop a web shell loader via SMB is to exploit the remote service to gain further access or execute additional payloads.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
