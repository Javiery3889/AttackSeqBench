### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where CVE-2021-40444 is exploited for client execution.
   - After this, multiple stages are used to obfuscate C2 (Command and Control) channels involving Empire stagers.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to conceal the execution of malicious payloads between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages to establish and maintain C2 communication.
   - **T1027.010-Command Obfuscation:** This sub-technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. While it can be used to deliver the initial payload, it does not directly conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027.008-Stripped Payloads**
     - Stripped payloads involve removing unnecessary data from a payload to make it smaller and harder to detect. This can be a form of obfuscation but is not specifically about concealing the execution of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
     - Reflective code loading involves loading a DLL or executable into memory without writing it to the disk. This technique is used to evade detection and can be used to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1587.004-Exploits**
     - This sub-technique involves using exploits to gain initial access or execute code. It is already mentioned in the question (CVE-2021-40444) and does not fit the context of concealing the execution of payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique to conceal the execution of malicious payloads is **T1620-Reflective Code Loading**.

**Final Answer: C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
