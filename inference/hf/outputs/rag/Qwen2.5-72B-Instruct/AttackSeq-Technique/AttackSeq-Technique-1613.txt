### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group maintained communication with a C&C server using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) and asks about the final step to disrupt the bank's operations during the FEIB heist.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to execute at specific times, which can be used for persistence or to trigger actions at a later time.
   - **T1053.002-At**: Similar to Scheduled Task, this technique uses the `at` command to schedule tasks.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands indirectly, often through scripts or other executables. While it can be used for various purposes, it doesn't directly align with the final step of disrupting operations.
   - **B: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This technique involves using legitimate Windows utilities to register .NET assemblies, which can be used for persistence or execution. However, it doesn't directly align with the final step of disrupting operations.
   - **C: T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion**: This technique involves deleting data or files based on certain triggers, such as a specific time or event. This could be a plausible final step to disrupt operations by deleting critical data.
   - **D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable, which is a common method to disrupt operations and cause significant damage. This aligns well with the final step of disrupting the bank's operations.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible final step to disrupt the bank's operations would be to encrypt critical data, making it unusable and causing significant disruption. This aligns with the goal of the FEIB heist and the nature of the Lazarus group's operations.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact
