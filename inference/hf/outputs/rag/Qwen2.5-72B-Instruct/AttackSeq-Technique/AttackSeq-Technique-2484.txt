### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to conceal command and control (C2) traffic after using reflective code loading for defense evasion.
   - Reflective code loading (T1620) is a technique used to load and execute code in memory without writing it to disk, which helps in evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique is used to load and execute code in memory, which is a form of defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect C2 communications. While it can be used to conceal traffic, it is not specifically related to the use of Microsoft OneDrive or Empire Server.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. It is not directly related to concealing C2 traffic.
   - **C: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols (e.g., FTP, SFTP) to transfer files. It is not specifically related to concealing C2 traffic using Microsoft OneDrive or Empire Server.
   - **D: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves modifying or bypassing multi-factor authentication. It is not related to concealing C2 traffic.

4. **Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves using mail protocols (T1071.003) to conceal C2 traffic. Microsoft OneDrive and Empire Server can both be used to send and receive data over mail protocols, which can help in evading detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: **T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
