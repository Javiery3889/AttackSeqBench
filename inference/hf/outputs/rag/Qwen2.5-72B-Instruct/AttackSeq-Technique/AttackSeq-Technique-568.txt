### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has already collected basic information such as IP address, hostname, and Bitcoin wallet addresses during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to gather screen recording files, which falls under the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, such as IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the hostname, operating system, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1036.006-Space after Filename:** This technique involves adding a space after the filename to hide files or executables. This is more related to Persistence and Defense Evasion, not Collection.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is directly related to the Collection phase and aligns with the need to gather screen recording files.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system. This is more related to the Discovery phase, not Collection.
   - **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves using messaging applications to exfiltrate data. While it is related to Collection, it is more about the method of exfiltration rather than the actual collection of screen recordings.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of gathering screen recording files in the Collection phase, is **T1113-Screen Capture**.

**Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture**
