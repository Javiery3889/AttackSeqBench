### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malware uses a hijacked DLL for defense evasion, specifically to protect shellcode in memory using `localAlloc` and `VirtualProtect`.
   - After this, the malware communicates with its C2 infrastructure using a legitimate ESET Remote Administrator tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location that will be searched before the legitimate DLL, allowing the malware to execute its code.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, often by exploiting a vulnerability in the application's loading process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting languages to execute commands. It does not directly relate to the communication with C2 infrastructure using a legitimate tool.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1001.001-Junk Data**
     - This technique involves adding junk data to obfuscate the content of a file or network traffic. It does not fit the context of using a legitimate tool for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice communication to trick a target into performing an action. It is not relevant to the context of C2 communication using a legitimate tool.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality of data in transit. It is highly relevant to the context of C2 communication, especially when using a legitimate tool to mask the communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of using a legitimate ESET Remote Administrator tool for C2 communication, is the use of an encrypted channel to protect the communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
