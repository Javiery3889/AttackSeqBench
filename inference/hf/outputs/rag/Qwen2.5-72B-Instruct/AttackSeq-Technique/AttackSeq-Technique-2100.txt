### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails with weaponized DOCX documents.
   - After gaining initial access, a multi-stage infection chain was initiated, leading to the execution of malicious code.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial access and the execution of the malicious code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear-phishing with attachments, such as weaponized DOCX documents, to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions before executing the payload. While this could be part of the infection chain, it is not typically the next step after gaining initial access and executing the malicious code.
   - **B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a client application to execute malicious code. This could be part of the initial access phase, but the question specifies that the initial access was already gained through spear-phishing.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and executing the malicious code to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.
   - **D: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. While this could be used for persistence, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access and executing the malicious code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access through spear-phishing and executing the malicious code is to establish a secure communication channel with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique to occur next is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
