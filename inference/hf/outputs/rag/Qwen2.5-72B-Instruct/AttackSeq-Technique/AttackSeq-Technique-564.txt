### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware collected basic system and Bitcoin wallet information (Discovery phase) and before it initiated logging activities like screen recording and keylogging (Collection phase).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1592.003-Firmware:** This technique involves collecting information from firmware, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery:** This technique involves discovering cloud storage objects, which is not relevant to the sequence of collecting system information and initiating logging activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the screen, which is a logging activity and would occur after the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves enumerating and collecting log files, which is a logical step between discovering system information and initiating logging activities like screen recording and keylogging.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred after the malware collected basic system and Bitcoin wallet information and before it initiated logging activities is **T1654-Log Enumeration**.

**Final Answer: D: T1654-Log Enumeration**
