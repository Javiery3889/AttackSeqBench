### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by ATMitch malware to avoid detection before it targeted the 'fwmain32.exe' process to recognize its banking environment.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware was manually installed.
     - It needed to avoid detection.
     - It targeted a specific process to recognize its environment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is not directly related to avoiding detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to occur at specific intervals or during periods of low activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:**
     - This technique is specific to bypassing macOS security features and is not relevant to the context of an ATM environment.
   - **B: T1127.001-MSBuild:**
     - This technique involves using the MSBuild utility to execute arbitrary code, which is not directly related to avoiding detection.
   - **C: T1657-Financial Theft:**
     - This technique involves stealing financial data, which is a goal of the attack but not a method to avoid detection.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to avoid detection. This aligns well with the need to avoid detection before targeting the 'fwmain32.exe' process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need to avoid detection, the most plausible technique is **T1055-Process Injection**.

**Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection**
