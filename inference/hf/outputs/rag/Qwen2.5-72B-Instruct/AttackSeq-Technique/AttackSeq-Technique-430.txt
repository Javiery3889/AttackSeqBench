### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Sednit group's malware uses an AutoIt downloader to gather system information. This information is then sent to a server, which deems the target interesting.
   - We need to determine the next logical step in the attack sequence after the reconnaissance and discovery phases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592.002-Software:** This technique involves using software to gather information about the target.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves actively scanning the network to identify potential targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1600-Weaken Encryption:** This technique involves weakening encryption to gain access to encrypted data. This is not a logical next step after reconnaissance and discovery.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. This could be a logical next step after the target is deemed interesting, as the attacker might need to establish a communication channel.
   - **C: T1558.002-Silver Ticket:** This technique involves using a Silver Ticket to authenticate to a service. This is a more advanced step and typically occurs after the attacker has gained initial access and is looking to maintain persistence or move laterally.
   - **D: T1219-Remote Access Software:** This technique involves using remote access software to gain persistent access to the target. This is a logical next step after the target is deemed interesting, as the attacker would want to maintain access for further operations.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B)** and **T1219-Remote Access Software (D)** are both plausible next steps.
   - However, **T1219-Remote Access Software** is more likely to be the immediate next step after the target is deemed interesting, as it allows the attacker to maintain persistent access and perform further actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1219-Remote Access Software
