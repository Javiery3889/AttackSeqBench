### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate information. The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to destroy data on targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the adversary destroying data on targeted systems, which can be done to disrupt operations or cover tracks.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the adversary exfiltrating data from the target network to a controlled location using the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):** This technique is used to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communication. It does not involve data destruction.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique directly aligns with the question's requirement to identify the technique used to destroy data on targeted systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or systems to gain unauthorized access or execute code. It does not involve data destruction.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It does not involve data destruction.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves data destruction.

**Final Answer: B: T1485-Data Destruction**
