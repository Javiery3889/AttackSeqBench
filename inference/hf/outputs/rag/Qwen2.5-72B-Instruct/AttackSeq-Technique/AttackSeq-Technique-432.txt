### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the AutoIt downloader used WMI objects to perform reconnaissance and gather process lists during victim system discovery.
   - The key points are:
     - The AutoIt downloader used WMI objects.
     - The action involved reconnaissance and gathering process lists.
     - The focus is on what happened next in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering system services, which can provide information about the system and its configuration.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation:**
     - This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and gather information, which aligns with the use of WMI objects for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering peripheral devices connected to the system, which is not directly related to the next logical step after gathering process lists.
   - **B: T1547.015-Login Items:**
     - This technique involves modifying login items to maintain persistence, which is more related to the persistence phase rather than the discovery phase.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the operating system version, installed software, and system configuration. This is a logical next step after gathering process lists, as it provides a broader understanding of the system.
   - **D: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:**
     - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is more related to network reconnaissance and not directly related to the next step after gathering process lists.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible next step after gathering process lists using WMI objects would be to gather more detailed system information.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**.

Final Answer: **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
