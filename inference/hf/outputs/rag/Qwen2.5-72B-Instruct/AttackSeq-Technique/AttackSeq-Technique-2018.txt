### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Welcome Chat app collects device information, including GPS location.
   - The focus is on ensuring the app’s functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms that prevent unauthorized software from running.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the device's location, such as GPS coordinates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass:** This technique is used to bypass security warnings when downloading files from the internet. It is not relevant to ensuring the app starts automatically on device boot.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the app runs automatically when the device starts. This is directly relevant to the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546.014-Emond:** This technique is specific to macOS and involves using the `emond` service to execute commands. It is not a general technique for ensuring autostart on all platforms.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video from the device’s camera. It is not relevant to ensuring the app starts automatically on device boot.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the app’s functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
