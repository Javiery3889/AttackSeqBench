### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers use Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping and clearing log files to conceal their activity. The next step in the sequence is executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another to support lateral movement.
   - **T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs:** This technique is used to clear log files to avoid detection.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to cause a denial of service or to demand a ransom. It does not fit the context of lateral movement or remote execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
     - This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. It is not directly related to remote execution or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to execute commands on remote systems, which is a key part of lateral movement. This fits the context of the question, where the attackers are executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1583.004-Server**
     - This technique involves using a server to support malicious activities, but it does not specifically describe the execution of processes on remote computers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using remote services to execute processes on remote computers for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
