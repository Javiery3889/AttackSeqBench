### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to download and transfer the Dropper module to the compromised system before the Remote shell module communicated with the C&C server for operations like file transfer and process creation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Command and Control" and the Technique is "T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to access a system. While it can be used for initial access, it is not specifically about transferring tools or modules.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system. This aligns well with the question, as it specifically mentions downloading and transferring the Dropper module.
   - **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges. It is not related to the transfer of tools or modules.
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a C&C server. It is more about maintaining command and control rather than transferring tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer to download and transfer the Dropper module to the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
