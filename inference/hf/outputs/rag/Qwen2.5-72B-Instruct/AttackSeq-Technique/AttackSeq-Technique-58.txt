### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a host system is compromised by clicking on a malicious link.
   - After the initial compromise, the ScarCruft group uses Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002 - Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **T1204.001 - Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1602 - Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which is not directly related to the initial compromise via a malicious link.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566 - Phishing:** This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link. This aligns well with the initial compromise described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1195.003 - Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is not relevant to the initial compromise via a malicious link.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1036.001 - Invalid Code Signature:** This technique involves using an invalid code signature to bypass security checks, which is not directly related to the initial compromise via a malicious link.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial compromise occurred via a phishing attack, which led to the user clicking on a malicious link. This aligns with the related TTP T1204.001 - Malicious Link.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
