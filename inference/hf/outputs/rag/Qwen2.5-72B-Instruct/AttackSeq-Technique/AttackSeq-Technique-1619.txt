### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT28 has ensured persistence by altering the timestamps of files downloaded by the second stage dropper to conceal them from victims.
   - The key action here is the alteration of file timestamps to hide the files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Defense Evasion
     - **Technique:** T1070.006-Timestomp
   - T1070.006-Timestomp is a sub-technique of T1070-Indicator Removal, which involves altering file metadata to hide the presence of malicious files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. It does not relate to altering file timestamps.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1218.013-Mavinject**
     - This technique involves using a legitimate Windows utility (mavinject) to inject code into processes. It does not relate to altering file timestamps.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which includes T1070.006-Timestomp. This is the most relevant technique as it directly involves altering file timestamps to hide the files.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.017-Udev Rules**
     - This technique involves modifying udev rules to achieve persistence on Linux systems. It does not relate to altering file timestamps.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 used T1070-Indicator Removal, specifically T1070.006-Timestomp, to alter the timestamps of files to conceal them from victims.

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
