### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after gaining domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz.
   - The focus is on what likely occurred before deploying backdoors like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This indicates that the attacker used valid domain accounts to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This suggests that the attacker used domain accounts to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This indicates that the attacker collected credentials as part of their reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow:** This technique is specific to Unix-like systems and involves dumping credentials from the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files. Since the question mentions Mimikatz, which is used on Windows systems, this is not relevant.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not directly related to credential dumping or backdoor deployment.
   - **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **D: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding payloads in files, which is not directly related to the sequence of gaining credentials and deploying backdoors.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first used Mimikatz to dump credentials (T1003-OS Credential Dumping) to gain domain administrator access.
   - After gaining the credentials, the attacker would then deploy backdoors like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping
