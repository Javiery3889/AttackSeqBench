### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, specifically what technique likely occurred after the attackers used PowerShell scripts for profiling the computer.
   - The goal is to identify accounts within the Active Directory database.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile (Persistence):** This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute arbitrary commands or scripts when PowerShell is invoked.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell (Execution):** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying accounts on a system or within a domain, which aligns with the goal of identifying accounts within the Active Directory database.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1037.004-RC Scripts**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating registry keys to execute scripts, which is more related to persistence and not directly to account discovery.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details. While this can be a step in the reconnaissance phase, it is not directly related to account discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which is more related to execution and not directly to account discovery.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after using PowerShell scripts to profile the computer (T1059.001-PowerShell), the next step would be to discover accounts within the Active Directory database (T1087-Account Discovery).
   - The other techniques (T1037.004-RC Scripts, T1082-System Information Discovery, and T1106-Native API) do not align as closely with the goal of identifying accounts.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1087-Account Discovery
