### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an adversary uses HTML Smuggling to bypass security controls and then loads a malicious DLL via DLL Hijacking into a legitimate process for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique is used to bypass security controls by embedding malicious content in HTML files.
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location that is searched before the legitimate DLL, causing the malicious DLL to be loaded instead.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process by exploiting the way the process loads its dependencies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS:** This technique is related to DNS monitoring and does not fit the context of defense evasion or loading a malicious DLL.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules, but it does not specifically describe the loading of a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files, which is not directly related to the loading of a malicious DLL.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique fits the context of the question, as it describes the process of loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process by manipulating the DLL search order.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**.

**Final Answer: D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
