### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before Black Energy 2 used HTTP requests for communication with the C&C server.
   - The focus is on the communication method and the sequence of events leading up to it.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Command and Control**
     - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
   - This indicates that the communication method (HTTP) is a key part of the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves disrupting network availability, which is not directly related to establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) for communication. This aligns well with the use of HTTP for C&C communication.
   - **C: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
     - This technique involves filtering network traffic at the socket level, which is not directly related to establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
     - This technique involves manipulating conditional access policies, which is not directly related to establishing communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware would use an application layer protocol (HTTP) to communicate with the C&C server. This aligns with the related TTPs and the context of the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
