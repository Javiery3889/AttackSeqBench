### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals have collected usernames, passwords, and email credentials through phishing sites.
   - After collecting this information, the cybercriminals demand payment in bitcoin or other means for the return of Instagram accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information or demanding payment, which aligns with the demand for payment in the question.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts:** This technique involves compromising accounts, which is relevant to the collection of usernames and passwords.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts:** This sub-technique specifically involves compromising email accounts, which is also relevant to the collection of email credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the initial act of phishing, which is used to collect the credentials. However, it does not cover the subsequent demand for payment.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1498.001-Direct Network Flood:** This technique involves a denial-of-service attack, which is not relevant to the scenario described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070.008-Clear Mailbox Data:** This technique involves clearing mailbox data, which is not relevant to the demand for payment.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information or demanding payment, which directly aligns with the demand for payment in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1657-Financial Theft**.

**Final Answer: D: T1657-Financial Theft**
