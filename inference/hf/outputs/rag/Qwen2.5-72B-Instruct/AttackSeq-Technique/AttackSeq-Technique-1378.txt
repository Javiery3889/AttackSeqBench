### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already collected browser history, cached credentials, and FTP client settings during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is the attacker attempting lateral movement using stolen admin credentials or vulnerabilities like MS08-067.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.015-ListPlanting:** This technique involves planting a list of processes to be executed, which is not directly related to the collection of credentials or lateral movement.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning the LLMNR and NBT-NS protocols to capture and relay authentication requests, which can be used to steal credentials. This is relevant to the collection of credentials but not directly to the lateral movement using stolen admin credentials.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which aligns with the collection of credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **D: T1137-Office Application Startup:** This technique involves using Office application startup to execute malicious code, which is not directly related to the collection of credentials or lateral movement.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the collection of credentials during the reconnaissance phase is **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**.
   - After collecting the credentials, the attacker would then use these credentials for lateral movement, which aligns with the next step in the sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
