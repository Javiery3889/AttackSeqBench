### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a vulnerability exploit is used to execute an embedded .hta file via `mshta.exe`.
   - The goal is to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.005-Mshta**: This technique involves using `mshta.exe` to execute arbitrary code, which aligns with the initial part of the question where an embedded .hta file is executed.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at regular intervals, which aligns with the goal of maintaining the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique is used to clear logs to avoid detection, but it does not help in maintaining the presence of the agent by executing files at regular intervals.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute code at regular intervals, which directly aligns with the goal of maintaining the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is not relevant to maintaining the presence of the agent by executing files at regular intervals.
   - **D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing file associations to execute malicious code, but it does not involve scheduling tasks to execute files at regular intervals.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the goal of maintaining the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by executing files at regular intervals, the most plausible answer is **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.

Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
