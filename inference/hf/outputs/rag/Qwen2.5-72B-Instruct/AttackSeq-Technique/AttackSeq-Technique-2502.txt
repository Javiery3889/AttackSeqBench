### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access scenario where CVE 2014-0515 is exploited via a watering hole attack.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur to maintain communication with the compromised systems after the initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors, often used in watering hole attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1219-Remote Access Software:** This technique involves using remote access software to maintain persistent access to a compromised system.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems, which is not typically used for maintaining communication after initial access.
   - **C: T1219-Remote Access Software:** This is the same as option A.
   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique is used for initial access, not for maintaining communication after the initial access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved via a watering hole attack, which is described by T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker would need to maintain communication with the compromised system.
   - The most likely technique for maintaining communication is T1219-Remote Access Software, as it allows the attacker to establish a persistent connection to the compromised system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1219-Remote Access Software
