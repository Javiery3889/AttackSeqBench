### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first gathers OS and user details, including Bitcoin wallet addresses, and then starts capturing user inputs such as keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Collection**
     - **Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
   - This indicates that the final stage involves keylogging, which is a form of input capture.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves the use of automated tools to collect data. However, it is not specific to the stage between gathering OS and user details and capturing user inputs.
   - **B: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
     - This technique is not relevant to the context of malware operations and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate data. While it could be used to exfiltrate data, it does not fit the stage between gathering OS and user details and capturing user inputs.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user inputs, which aligns with the final stage of the sequence described in the question. However, we need to find the technique that occurs before this stage.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurs after gathering OS and user details and before capturing user inputs is likely to be a form of data exfiltration or preparation for input capture.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most plausible choice because it involves using application layer protocols to communicate data, which could be used to exfiltrate the gathered OS and user details before the malware starts capturing user inputs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
