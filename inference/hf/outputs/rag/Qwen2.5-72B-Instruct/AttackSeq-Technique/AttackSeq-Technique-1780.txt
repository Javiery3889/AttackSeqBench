### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Sayad malware.
   - The malware gathers information such as system details, running processes, and open ports.
   - After gathering this information, it encrypts the data using an RSA public key and uploads it to the C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the information gathering but before the data encryption and exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access by the legitimate users.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data to a remote location.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen. It is not typically used for gathering system details, running processes, or open ports.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data before exfiltration. This is a logical step to take after gathering information and before encrypting and exfiltrating the data.
   - **C: T1612-Build Image on Host:** This technique involves creating a new image on the host, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence of actions is:
     1. Gather information (system details, running processes, open ports).
     2. Archive the collected data (to prepare it for exfiltration).
     3. Encrypt the data using an RSA public key.
     4. Exfiltrate the encrypted data to the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after gathering information and before encrypting and exfiltrating the data is **T1560-Archive Collected Data**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data
