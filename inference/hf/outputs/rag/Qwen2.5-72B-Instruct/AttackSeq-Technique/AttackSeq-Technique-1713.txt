### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Turla malware has used encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade defenses and hide its tracks. It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur as the attackers begin gathering specific information from systems to enhance their spying operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves creating or using hidden file systems to store data and evade detection.
   - **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves creating or using hidden files and directories to store data and evade detection.
   - **T1014-Rootkit:** This technique involves using rootkits to hide the presence of malware and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping the content of disks, which is not related to gathering information but rather to destroying data. This does not align with the scenario of gathering specific information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
     - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is a plausible next step after evading defenses and hiding tracks. It aligns with the goal of gathering specific information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is also a plausible next step after evading defenses and hiding tracks. It aligns with the goal of gathering specific information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1014-Rootkit**
     - This technique involves using rootkits, which is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial evasion and hiding tracks. It does not represent a new step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Both **Answer Choice B** and **Answer Choice C** are plausible, but **Answer Choice B** (T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive) is more specific to the context of gathering information from systems, which is a common next step after evading defenses and hiding tracks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive
