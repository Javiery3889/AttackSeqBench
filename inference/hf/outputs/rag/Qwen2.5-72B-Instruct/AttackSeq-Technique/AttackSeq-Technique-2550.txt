### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Milestone backdoor has already communicated with a C2 server to send information about current sessions.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure data exfiltration over the same communication channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Exfiltration" and the technique is "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - Network Sniffing involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. This technique is typically used for reconnaissance and not for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - System Information Discovery involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and network configuration. This technique is used for reconnaissance and not for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel involves sending data from the compromised system to the C2 server over the same channel used for command and control. This aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
     - Exfiltration Over Webhook involves sending data to a webhook, which is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application by customizing HTTP callbacks. This technique is not mentioned in the related TTPs and does not align with the scenario of using the same C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves exfiltration over the same C2 channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
