### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where OnionDog initially gains access by exploiting vulnerabilities in Hangul software and spreading through USB Worms.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with a C&C server and downloading additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the transfer of additional tools or malware from a C&C server to the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves using a compromised system to bridge network boundaries, which is not directly related to the initial access or the communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to a C&C server, which is a plausible step before downloading additional malware.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the DLL search order to load malicious code, which is more related to persistence and execution rather than communication with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1505.002-Transport Agent:** This technique involves using transport agents to intercept and manipulate email traffic, which is not directly related to the initial access or C&C communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access and spreading through USB Worms, the next step would be to establish communication with the C&C server. This is best represented by **T1133-External Remote Services**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1133-External Remote Services
