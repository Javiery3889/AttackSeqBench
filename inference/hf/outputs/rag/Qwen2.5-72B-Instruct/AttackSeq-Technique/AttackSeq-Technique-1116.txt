### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where LYCEUM uses spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, they deploy DanBot for execution.
   - The question then asks about the ATT&CK technique used when LYCEUM communicates with newly registered domains.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing with an attachment (T1566.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses. While it could be relevant to communication, it doesn't specifically address the use of newly registered domains for communication.
   - **B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain credentials. It is not directly related to communication with newly registered domains.
   - **C: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. It is not related to communication with newly registered domains.
   - **D: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves establishing bidirectional communication with a remote system, which can include the use of newly registered domains for command and control (C2) purposes. This aligns well with the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that LYCEUM used bidirectional communication with newly registered domains for C2 purposes.

**Final Answer: D: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
