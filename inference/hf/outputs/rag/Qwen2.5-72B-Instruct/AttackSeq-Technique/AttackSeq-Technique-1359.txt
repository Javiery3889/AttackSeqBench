### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack where a first stage downloader saves a file at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" and later retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
   - The attack involves a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising the malicious file or process to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique involves using a service (like email) to send spearphishing messages. While it is a method of initial access, it does not fit the context of a compromised website.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels for command and control. While it is relevant to the command and control phase, it does not describe the initial access method.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1648-Serverless Execution:** This technique involves executing code without a traditional server. It is not relevant to the initial access method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. This fits the context of the compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities."

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.

**Final Answer: D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
