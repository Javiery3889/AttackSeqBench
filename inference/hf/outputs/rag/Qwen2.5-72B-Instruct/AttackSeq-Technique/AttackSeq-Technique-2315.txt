### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     1. The adversary established C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike.
     2. The adversary then exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate protocols to tunnel C2 traffic. HTTPS encapsulation is a form of protocol tunneling.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves maintaining a bidirectional communication channel. While it is related to C2, it does not specifically address the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials:**
     - This technique involves using additional cloud credentials to maintain access. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. While it is related to the HTTPS encapsulation, it does not specifically address the exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This technique directly aligns with the described sequence of events where the adversary exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services over the established C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
