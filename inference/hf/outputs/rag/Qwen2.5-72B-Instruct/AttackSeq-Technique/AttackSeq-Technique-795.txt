### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the wiper module used RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system under the Impact tactic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data to disrupt or destroy the availability of data.
   - **T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe:** This sub-technique involves the wiping of disk structures, such as the MBR, partitions, and files, to render the system inoperable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the destruction or wiping of data, so it is unlikely to be the technique that occurred before the wiper module.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1561-Disk Wipe:** This technique involves wiping the disk, which is a broader category that includes T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe. However, the question specifically mentions the use of RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files, which aligns more closely with T1561.002.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This sub-technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not related to data destruction or disk wiping.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood:** This sub-technique involves overwhelming services to cause denial of service. It is not related to data destruction or disk wiping.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the wiper module used RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files, which aligns with T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before this is T1561-Disk Wipe.

**Final Answer: B: T1561-Disk Wipe**
