### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Earth Wendigo has established a WebSocket connection for command and control.
   - The focus is on the technique used to transfer mailbox content and attachments to their server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket) for command and control.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the application layer to communicate.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not typically used for data exfiltration, such as DNS, ICMP, or WebSocket.
     - Given that a WebSocket connection is already established, this technique fits well with the scenario of transferring mailbox content and attachments.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code.
     - This is not relevant to the transfer of data over a WebSocket connection.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable during exfiltration.
     - While this could be used in conjunction with exfiltration, it does not directly describe the transfer of data over a WebSocket.
   - **D: T1537-Transfer Data to Cloud Account:**
     - This technique involves transferring data to a cloud account.
     - This is not relevant to the scenario of using a WebSocket connection for data transfer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the established WebSocket connection and the need to transfer mailbox content and attachments, is **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**.

**Final Answer: A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
