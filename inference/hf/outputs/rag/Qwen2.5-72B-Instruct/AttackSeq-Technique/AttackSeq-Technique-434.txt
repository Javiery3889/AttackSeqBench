### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the AutoIt downloader performed extensive reconnaissance on victim computers by retrieving a list of installed software and other system details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592.002-Software:** This technique involves gathering information about software installed on a target system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information such as the operating system, architecture, and other details.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about installed software on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle:** This technique involves intercepting and manipulating network traffic. It is not directly related to the reconnaissance or discovery of software and system details.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:** This technique involves searching public databases for technical information. While it can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not directly related to the specific task of discovering software and system details on the victim's computer.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard:** This technique involves using cloud service dashboards to gather information. It is not directly related to the discovery of software and system details on the victim's computer.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about installed software on a system. It aligns directly with the task of retrieving a list of installed software and other system details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific task described in the question, the most plausible sequence is that the AutoIt downloader performed **Software Discovery (T1518)** before conducting extensive reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: T1518-Software Discovery**
