### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already scanned the internal network for open ports to expand its foothold. The next step in the attack sequence is to move laterally within the network.
   - The focus is on the technique used for lateral movement after the initial network scanning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves scanning the network to identify open ports and services. This is the initial step that has already been completed.
   - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves tricking internal users to gain access to their systems or credentials. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not the most direct method after network scanning.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement. This is a common step after identifying open ports and services.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques used to move through a network to expand the attacker's control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking an existing session to gain access to a remote system. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not typically the first step after network scanning.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. This is a common and direct method for lateral movement after identifying open ports and services.
   - **C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting:** This technique involves requesting and cracking Kerberos service tickets to obtain credentials. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is more specific to credential theft and not a direct method for moving through the network.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. This is typically used for initial access, not for lateral movement within an internal network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the attacker using the information from network scanning to exploit remote services for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
