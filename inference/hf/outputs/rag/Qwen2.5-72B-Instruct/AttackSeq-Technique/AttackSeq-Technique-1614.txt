### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group used lateral movement through SMB shares with hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to disrupt the bank's operations and delay the response to the heist.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic used was Lateral Movement, and the specific technique was T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares.
   - This confirms that the initial action was lateral movement through SMB shares.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**
     - This technique involves preventing the system from being restored or rebooted, which can disrupt operations and delay response.
   - **B: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**
     - This technique is related to bypassing security mechanisms when downloading files from the web, which is not directly related to disrupting operations or delaying response.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with remote systems, which is not directly related to disrupting operations or delaying response.
   - **D: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking compute resources, which is not directly related to disrupting operations or delaying response.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique to disrupt the bank's operations and delay the response to the heist is **T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**. This technique can prevent the system from being restored or rebooted, which would effectively disrupt operations and delay the response to the heist.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery
