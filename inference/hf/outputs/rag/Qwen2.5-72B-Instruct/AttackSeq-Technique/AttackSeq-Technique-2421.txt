### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection and maintain backdoor connections, specifically mentioning the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.
   - The focus is on the technique that likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols to tunnel command and control (C2) traffic, which can help evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance:** This technique involves running a virtual instance to hide the presence of malicious activities. While it can be used for evasion, it does not directly align with the use of `plink.exe` for RDP over SSH.
   - **B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution:** This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which can be used to evade detection. However, it does not specifically relate to maintaining backdoor connections or using `plink.exe`.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malicious payloads. It does not align with the use of `plink.exe` for RDP over SSH.
   - **D: T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using add-ins to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to maintaining backdoor connections or using `plink.exe`.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH, which is a form of lateral movement and command and control. The related TTPs suggest that the attackers likely used protocol tunneling (T1572) to maintain their backdoor connections and evade detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most appropriate answer based on the context and related TTPs is:

Final Answer: **T1572-Protocol Tunneling** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant technique based on the given context.) 

Given the choices, the closest and most relevant answer is:

Final Answer: **B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
