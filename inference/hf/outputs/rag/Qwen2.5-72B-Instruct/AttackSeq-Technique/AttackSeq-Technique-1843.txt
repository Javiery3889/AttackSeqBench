### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers to coordinate its malicious activities.
   - This implies that the sequence of events is: BlackEnergy communicates with C&C servers, and then performs another action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.003-Hidden Window:** This technique involves hiding windows to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking compute resources, which is not typically a follow-up action after C&C communication.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less useful to defenders, which could be a follow-up action to avoid detection after C&C communication.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data, which is a more aggressive and final action that might occur after C&C communication but is not typically the immediate next step.
   - **D: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information, which is a specific goal that might be pursued after C&C communication but is not a common immediate follow-up.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation** (B) is the most plausible follow-up action after C&C communication. It aligns with the goal of evading detection, which is a common tactic used by malware after establishing communication with C&C servers.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1001-Data Obfuscation
