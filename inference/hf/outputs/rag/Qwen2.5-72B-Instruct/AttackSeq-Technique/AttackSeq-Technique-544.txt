### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the threat actors gained initial access via spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access was gained via spearphishing.
     - The spearphishing involved malicious Word documents with VBA macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBA) for execution, which aligns with the VBA macros in the Word documents.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments, which aligns with the spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure (e.g., domains, servers) to support the attack. While this is a necessary step in many attacks, it typically occurs before the actual spearphishing campaign and is not directly related to the execution of the VBA macros.
   - **B: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood:**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with resource requests, which is not related to the spearphishing or VBA macro execution.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target. This is not related to the spearphishing or VBA macro execution.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves the use of phishing to gain initial access. The specific sub-technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is directly related to the spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actors used spearphishing with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros to gain initial access. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before this is the acquisition of the infrastructure needed to send the spearphishing emails.

However, since the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred before the initial access via spearphishing, the most direct and relevant answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
