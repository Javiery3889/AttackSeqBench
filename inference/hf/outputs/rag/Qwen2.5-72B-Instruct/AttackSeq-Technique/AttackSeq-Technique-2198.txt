### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Earth Lusca group.
   - The group deployed containers and used obfuscation techniques.
   - The final action in the sequence is dumping the memory of the lsass process using procdump to obtain credential hashes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Credential Access** and the technique is **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**.
   - This technique involves extracting credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the sequence described, which involves post-exploitation activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and defenses. This could be a plausible step before dumping memory to ensure that security tools do not interfere with the process.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**
     - This technique involves removing or modifying indicators of compromise from tools used in the attack. While this is a plausible post-exploitation activity, it is more about covering tracks rather than preparing for memory dumping.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves abusing mechanisms that control the elevation of privileges. This is a critical step before dumping memory, as the attacker needs elevated privileges to access the LSASS process.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the group first abused elevation control mechanisms to gain the necessary privileges to dump the memory of the lsass process.
   - This aligns with the need to have elevated privileges to perform the memory dump, which is a common prerequisite for credential access techniques like T1003.001-LSASS Memory.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
