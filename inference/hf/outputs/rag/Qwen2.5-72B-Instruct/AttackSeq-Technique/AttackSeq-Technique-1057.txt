### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT group uses advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations and stay details. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable the group to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering system network configurations, which can help them understand the network environment and identify potential targets.
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the victim's network, which can be used for further reconnaissance and planning.
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves using dynamic resolution to maintain command and control (C2) infrastructure, which can help adversaries maintain a flexible and resilient network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1608.001-Upload Malware:** This technique involves uploading malware to a victim's system. While this is a common step in many attacks, it does not directly relate to maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server. While important for maintaining secure communication, it does not directly address the maintenance of a dynamic network infrastructure.
   - **C: T1584.002-DNS Server:** This technique involves compromising DNS servers, which can be used to redirect traffic and maintain control over the network. However, it is more specific to DNS manipulation rather than the broader infrastructure.
   - **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:** This technique involves compromising infrastructure, which can include a wide range of resources such as servers, networks, and other critical components. This aligns well with the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**. This technique directly addresses the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure by compromising various resources, which is essential for the Darkhotel APT to operate effectively.

**Final Answer: D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
