### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a master program (netsat.exe) is used to control and communicate with malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) for execution and data collection.
   - The focus is on the final step of the attack sequence, which involves cleaning up traces of the malware to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing malware in a location that mimics legitimate files to avoid detection.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to load and execute arbitrary code, often for malicious purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**
     - This technique involves preventing the logging of command history, which can help avoid detection. However, it is more specific to command history and not the broader cleanup of traces.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique directly aligns with the question's focus on cleaning up traces of the malware to avoid detection. It involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which is a common step in the final stages of an attack to cover tracks.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which is typically used in the early stages of an attack to understand the environment. It does not align with the cleanup phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain higher privileges, which is more relevant to the initial stages of an attack for privilege escalation. It does not align with the cleanup phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the final step of cleaning up traces of the malware to avoid detection is **T1070-Indicator Removal**.

**Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
