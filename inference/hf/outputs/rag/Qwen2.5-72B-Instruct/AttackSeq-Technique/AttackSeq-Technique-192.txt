### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where files are collected from the local system and then exfiltrated at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a prerequisite for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could include Tor and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic, which is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of files from the local system.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.003-Hidden Window:** This technique involves hiding the presence of a window, which is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a schedule for data transfer, which aligns with the description of exfiltration at regular intervals.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook, which is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the use of Tor and SSH connections.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the files were collected from the local system (T1005-Data from Local System) and then exfiltrated at regular intervals (T1029-Scheduled Transfer) using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

**Final Answer: C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
