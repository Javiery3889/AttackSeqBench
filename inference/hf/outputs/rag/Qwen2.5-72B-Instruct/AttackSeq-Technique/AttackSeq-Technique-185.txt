### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the malware "Infamous Chisel":
     - It collects predefined files of interest from the local system.
     - It enumerates data directories and gathers system information.
     - It exfiltrates these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries enumerating files and directories to find specific files of interest.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.001-Web Cookies:**
     - This technique involves collecting web cookies, which is not relevant to enumerating data directories and gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which is not relevant to the discovery phase of the attack.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087.004-Cloud Account:**
     - This technique involves discovering and using cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the local file and directory discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique directly aligns with the need to enumerate data directories and gather system information, which is a crucial step before collecting and exfiltrating files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
     - **Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
