### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an initial communication with a C2 server is established using HTTP connections and specific URIs like `<c2-domain>/login.php`.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves transferring stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the command and control infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, but it does not describe the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetric encrypted protocol that is not the same as the C2 channel. This does not align with the scenario where data is exfiltrated over the same C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communications, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
