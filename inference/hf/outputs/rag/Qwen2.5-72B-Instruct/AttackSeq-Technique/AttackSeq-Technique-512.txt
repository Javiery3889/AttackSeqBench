### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved persistence using HKCU autorun system registry keys (Run and RunOnce).
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves transmitting encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has used the **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** technique for persistence and privilege escalation.
   - This technique is part of the **Persistence** and **Privilege Escalation** tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim organization, which is not relevant to the transmission of data to a C2 server.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This aligns with the described scenario of transmitting data via HTTP POST requests.
   - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication, which does not fit the scenario of using HTTP POST requests.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs and is used for achieving persistence, not for communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of transmitting encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure, is **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
