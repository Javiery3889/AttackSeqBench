### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in Operation Pawn Storm where multistage downloaders and phishing websites were used to redirect targets to fake OWA (Outlook Web Access) log-in pages for credential harvesting.
   - The focus is on the technique used to capture credentials by logging victim input on these fake log-in pages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials by using a web portal to trick the victim into entering their credentials.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for later use.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. It does not directly relate to capturing credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which can include credentials. The sub-technique T1056.003-Web Portal Capture is specifically mentioned in the related TTPs, making this a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt data. It does not directly relate to capturing credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1110.003-Password Spraying:** This technique involves using a list of commonly used passwords to attempt to log in to accounts. It does not directly relate to capturing credentials from a web portal.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific mention of T1056.003-Web Portal Capture, the most plausible answer is B: T1056-Input Capture.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
