### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious file named `System.doc` is executed.
   - After execution, Defense Evasion techniques are detected by FireEye's ExploitGuard, specifically in Microsoft Excel.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is from the **Execution** tactic: **T1204.002 - Malicious File**.
   - This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into executing a malicious file, which aligns with the scenario of the user opening `System.doc`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1056 - Input Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or credentials. It is typically used after initial access to gather more information or credentials.
     - This does not align well with the sequence described, as it is not a typical initial step after executing a malicious file.

   - **B: T1491 - Defacement:**
     - This technique involves altering or defacing websites or other information systems. It is not typically associated with the initial stages of an attack or with the execution of a malicious file.
     - This does not fit the context of the question.

   - **C: T1098 - Account Manipulation:**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating accounts to maintain access or escalate privileges. It is often used after initial access to establish persistence.
     - This is a plausible technique but is more likely to occur after the initial execution and defense evasion.

   - **D: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. It is often used to maintain persistence and can be a step taken after initial execution to ensure the malware runs again.
     - This fits well with the sequence described, as it is a common technique used after the initial execution of a malicious file to ensure the malware persists and can evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the malicious file `System.doc` was executed, and then a scheduled task or job was created to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred before Defense Evasion is **T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**.

**Final Answer: D: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**
