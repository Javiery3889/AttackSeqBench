### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Duke group collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files for operational control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
     - This technique involves using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to boot a system. It is not directly related to the collection of bot/system information or the updating of bot configurations.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
     - This technique involves collecting data from a configuration repository. While it is related to data collection, it does not align with the specific context of updating bot configurations and uploading files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic. It is related to command and control but does not directly align with the specific actions of updating bot configurations and uploading files.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it. While it can be used in exfiltration, it does not directly align with the specific actions of updating bot configurations and uploading files.
   - **Related TTP: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files into the compromised environment. This aligns well with the context of updating bot configurations and uploading files for operational control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the transfer of tools or files into the compromised environment to update bot configurations and upload files for operational control.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
