### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the backdoor establishes communication with the C&C server using XML messages and collects system and geolocation information.
   - The focus is on enabling secure and encrypted communication for data transmission.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1001.001-Junk Data:** This technique involves adding junk data to the payload to evade detection. It does not directly relate to secure and encrypted communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect C2 communications, which aligns with the requirement for secure and encrypted communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it can be used to hide data, it does not specifically address secure and encrypted communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect credentials. It is more specific to credential protection and not general C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the requirement for secure and encrypted communication, the most plausible answer is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
