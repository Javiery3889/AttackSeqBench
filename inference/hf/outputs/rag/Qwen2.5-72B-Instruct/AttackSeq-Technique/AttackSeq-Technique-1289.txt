### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a macro within a lure document is enabled, and the malicious routine is triggered via `Document_Open()`.
   - The next step involves using PowerShell files (like `invoker.ps1`) to execute the final payload.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the stage before persistence was achieved.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands. While it is related to execution, it is not specific to the use of PowerShell files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it is a common technique in malware, it does not directly relate to the execution of PowerShell files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. PowerShell is a scripting interpreter, and this technique is directly related to the use of PowerShell files like `invoker.ps1`.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
     - This technique involves using domain generation algorithms to create a large number of domain names for command and control (C2) communication. It is not related to the execution of PowerShell files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is facilitated by the use of a command and scripting interpreter, specifically PowerShell, to execute the final payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
