### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by BRONZE PRESIDENT.
   - Specifically, it asks what technique likely occurred after using Wmiexec for lateral movement and before performing account discovery using tools like `net user`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This indicates that the attacker used SMB/Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This indicates that the attacker performed system owner/user discovery, which is a form of account discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1069.003-Cloud Groups:** This technique involves discovering cloud groups, which is not relevant to the context of using `net user` for account discovery in a local network environment.
   - **B: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video from a system, which is not related to account discovery or lateral movement.
   - **C: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves discovering system and domain accounts, which aligns with using tools like `net user` to understand the network environment.
   - **D: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves impairing defenses, which is not directly related to the sequence of lateral movement followed by account discovery.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Lateral movement using Wmiexec.
     2. An intermediate step (which we need to identify).
     3. Account discovery using tools like `net user`.
   - Given the related TTPs, the most logical intermediate step after lateral movement and before account discovery is **System Owner/User Discovery (T1033)**, which is a form of account discovery.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1087-Account Discovery
