### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the malware installer checked for VM execution during the installation process.
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Malware installer checks for VM execution.
     2. Malware uses hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory through a reflective loader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with the use of a reflective loader to load the Cobalt Strike beacon.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by checking for virtualization or sandbox environments.
   - **T1497.001-System Checks:** This sub-technique involves specific checks to determine if the system is a virtual machine or sandbox.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It does not fit the context of checking for VM execution or loading a beacon in memory.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is relevant to the initial step of checking for VM execution, but the question asks for the technique that occurs after this check.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with a command and control server. It does not fit the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This is the same as Answer Choice B and does not fit the context of the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. The malware installer checks for VM execution (T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion).
     2. After confirming the environment is not a VM or sandbox, the malware uses hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory through a reflective loader (T1620-Reflective Code Loading).
   - Since the question asks for the technique that occurs after the VM execution check, the correct answer should be related to the next step in the sequence, which is the reflective loading of the beacon.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **None of the provided answer choices directly fit the sequence described in the question. However, based on the context, the most relevant technique that occurs after the VM execution check is T1620-Reflective Code Loading. Since this is not an answer choice, the closest relevant answer is:**

**Final Answer: B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** (as it is the most relevant technique mentioned in the related TTPs, even though it does not fit the exact sequence described in the question).
