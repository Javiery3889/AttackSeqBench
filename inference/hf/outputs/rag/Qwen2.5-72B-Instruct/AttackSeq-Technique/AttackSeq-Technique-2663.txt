### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Korplug collects data from local and networked drives and gathers system information like system locale and IP addresses.
   - The next step in the sequence involves encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers for further interaction.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the collection of system locale and IP addresses.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the collection of data from local and networked drives.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using multiple C&C servers to ensure communication is maintained, which aligns with the fallback C&C servers mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves maintaining a two-way communication channel with the C&C server. While it is relevant to C&C, it does not specifically mention encrypted communication or fallback channels.
   - **B: T1027.003-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. It is not directly related to encrypted communication or C&C.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is already covered by T1005-Data from Local System.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C&C communication. It is relevant to encrypted communication and aligns with the need for secure communication with C&C servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need for encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers, the most plausible answer is **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
