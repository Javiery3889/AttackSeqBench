### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have used coordinated command and control to facilitate ATM withdrawals with physical mules. The final step involves manipulating the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network, which is relevant to the initial stages of the attack but not the final manipulation.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data or funds, which aligns with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malicious software. While it could be used in the initial stages of the attack, it does not align with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.
   - **B: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:** This technique involves preventing the system from being restored to a previous state. While it could be used to cover tracks, it does not directly relate to the final manipulation for financial gain.
   - **C: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique directly involves stealing financial data or funds, which aligns perfectly with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.
   - **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets:** This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to resources. While it could be used in the lateral movement phase, it does not directly relate to the final manipulation for financial gain.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains, which is best described by T1657-Financial Theft.

**Final Answer: C: T1657-Financial Theft**
