### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an iOS malware app that is installed with a hidden icon and runs in the background. It then collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the app began collecting this information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the app collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves discovering software on the system, which could be relevant for the app to understand what data is available to collect.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1647-Plist File Modification:** This technique involves modifying plist files to evade detection, which could be used to hide the app's icon and run it in the background.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it could be used to exfiltrate data, it is not a likely initial step before data collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage:** This technique involves using thread local storage to execute code. It is more relevant to Windows systems and is not typically used in the context of iOS malware.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking the user into executing the malware. This is a plausible initial step, as the user must install the app for it to run.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers:** This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. It is more relevant to Linux systems and is not typically used in the context of iOS malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible initial step before the app began collecting information is **T1204-User Execution**. This technique aligns with the user installing the app, which is a necessary step for the app to run and collect data.

**Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution**
