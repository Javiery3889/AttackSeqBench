### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke has collected sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
   - The focus is on the next step: transferring this collected information to remote servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data to a remote server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is about capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is also about capturing keystrokes, but specifically for credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which is not relevant to the scenario of transferring data to remote servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which is not related to the transfer of collected data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data to a remote server, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which is a specific method of exfiltration but not as general as automated exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is facilitated by **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**.

**Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
