### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred prior to gathering data on installed software as part of the discovery phase.
   - The context is that the Aria-body backdoor has already collected detailed host and network information from the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the victim's machine, such as IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and system architecture.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about installed software on the victim's machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to route network traffic. It is not directly related to the discovery phase of gathering system and network information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1069.003-Cloud Groups:** This technique involves discovering and enumerating cloud groups and roles. It is not directly related to the discovery of system and network information on a local machine.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique directly involves gathering information about installed software, which is the next step after collecting detailed host and network information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is not directly related to the discovery of system and network information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that after collecting detailed host and network information, the next step would be to gather information about installed software.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred prior to gathering data on installed software is **T1518-Software Discovery**.

Final Answer: **C: T1518-Software Discovery**
