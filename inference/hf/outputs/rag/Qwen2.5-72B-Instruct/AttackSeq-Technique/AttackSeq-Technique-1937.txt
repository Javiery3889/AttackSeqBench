### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Smooth Operator malware ensured persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware ensured persistence.
     - It abused a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary:** This technique involves modifying or replacing a legitimate binary with a malicious one to maintain persistence.
   - **T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves placing malicious code within a legitimate server software component to maintain persistence.
   - **T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking Security Support Provider (SSP) or Trust Provider (TP) interfaces to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1176-Browser Extensions**
     - This technique involves adding or modifying browser extensions to perform malicious activities. It does not align with the context of ensuring persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1505-Server Software Component**
     - This technique involves placing malicious code within a legitimate server software component, which aligns well with the context of ensuring persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering system and network account information. It does not align with the context of ensuring persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites. It does not align with the context of ensuring persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Smooth Operator malware used T1505-Server Software Component to ensure persistence by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.

**Final Answer: B: T1505-Server Software Component**
