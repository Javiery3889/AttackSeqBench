### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by GreyEnergy operators.
   - They used modular malware with partial AES-256 encryption and fileless execution techniques.
   - They then used only selected modules on specific targets for increased stealth.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access or use by the victim.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or payloads to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. While this could be a part of the initial attack, it does not directly relate to the described sequence of using modular malware and fileless execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling:** This technique involves using LNK files to smuggle icons and potentially execute malicious code. This is not directly related to the described sequence of using modular malware and fileless execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for communication. While this could be used for command and control, it does not directly relate to the described sequence of using modular malware and fileless execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. This aligns well with the described sequence, as using only selected modules on specific targets for increased stealth is a form of hiding artifacts to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
