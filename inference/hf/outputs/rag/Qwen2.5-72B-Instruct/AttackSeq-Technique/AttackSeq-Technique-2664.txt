### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Korplug has already collected metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using a non-standard port for communication, which can help evade detection by network security systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using a protocol that is not typically used for the application layer, which can also help evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1608-Stage Capabilities:** This technique involves preparing for future operations by staging capabilities, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique is directly related to the use of a non-standard port for communication, which aligns with the scenario of establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process, which is not relevant to establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to the use of a custom TCP-based protocol for communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of a non-standard port for communication, which is described by T1571-Non-Standard Port.

**Final Answer: B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
