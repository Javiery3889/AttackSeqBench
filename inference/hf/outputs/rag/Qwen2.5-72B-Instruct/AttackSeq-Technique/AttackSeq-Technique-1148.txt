### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where "mic.exe" is executed to load and decrypt associated files, and then it asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated communication with the C&C server after decoding the "mic.ver" configuration file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic. This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable by the adversary.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature. While it is related to obfuscation, it does not directly facilitate communication with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
     - This sub-technique involves the use of encrypted or encoded files to evade detection. While it is related to encoding, it does not directly facilitate communication with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This sub-technique involves the use of web protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server. This is a plausible choice because after decoding the configuration file, the adversary would need to establish communication with the C&C server, and web protocols are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of files or information. While it is related to obfuscation, it does not directly facilitate communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after decoding the "mic.ver" configuration file, the adversary would use web protocols to communicate with the C&C server. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
