### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the BlackEnergy 3 malware gathers network information using the `GetAdaptersInfo()` API for lateral movement.
   - The next step in the sequence is to send the captured data to the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system, which aligns with the use of `GetAdaptersInfo()`.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is a form of data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server, which fits the scenario of sending captured network information to the C2 server.
   - **B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a client application to execute code, which does not fit the scenario of sending data to a C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate, which is a method of exfiltration but is not specific to sending data to a C2 server.
   - **D: T1537-Transfer Data to Cloud Account:** This technique involves transferring data to a cloud account, which is not relevant to sending data to a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
