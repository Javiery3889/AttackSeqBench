### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses backdoor malware embedded within trusted software for stealthy code execution.
   - The attacker then maintains access before leveraging the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement within the victim network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021-Remote Services**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**
   - These TTPs confirm that the attacker is using RDP for lateral movement, which is consistent with the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1136-Create Account**
     - This technique involves creating a new account on the victim system. While this can be used to maintain access, it is not the most likely technique to be used immediately after code execution and before leveraging RDP.
   - **B: T1586-Compromise Accounts**
     - This technique involves compromising existing accounts on the victim system. This is a plausible technique to maintain access and can be used before leveraging RDP for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking dynamic libraries to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not typically used to maintain access in the context of RDP lateral movement.
   - **D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
     - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most likely technique to be used immediately before leveraging RDP for lateral movement.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker compromises existing accounts (T1586) to maintain access before using RDP for lateral movement. This aligns well with the context provided in the question and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1586-Compromise Accounts
