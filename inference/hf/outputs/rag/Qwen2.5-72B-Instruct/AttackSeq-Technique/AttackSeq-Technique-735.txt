### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after gathering detailed reconnaissance information and before achieving persistence by not changing the victim's account passwords.
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Gathering detailed reconnaissance information.
     2. Some intermediate step.
     3. Achieving persistence by not changing the victim's account passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.004-Identify Roles:** This technique involves identifying the roles of individuals within an organization, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts to maintain access to a system, which is part of the persistence phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials, which can be part of the reconnaissance phase but can also be used to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves modifying authentication processes to use reversible encryption, which is not typically a reconnaissance or persistence technique. It is more related to defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system. It fits well between reconnaissance and persistence, as it can be used to gather credentials and gain access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering identity information, which is part of the reconnaissance phase. However, it is not typically the next step after detailed reconnaissance and before persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique is part of the persistence phase, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering detailed information about the target, including roles and credentials.
     2. **Initial Access:** Using phishing to gain access to the system.
     3. **Persistence:** Using local accounts to maintain access without changing passwords.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred between gathering detailed reconnaissance information and achieving persistence is **T1566-Phishing**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
