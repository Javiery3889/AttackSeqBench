### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used FTP and HTTP channels for Command and Control (C2) communication.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure the scheduled transfer of collected data to a remote server every 10 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from the compromised system to a remote location.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a schedule to transfer data at specific intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automatic transfer of data, which is a part of the exfiltration process. However, it does not specifically mention scheduling.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1484.002-Trust Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying trust relationships, which is not relevant to the scheduling of data transfer.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering network configurations, which is not related to the scheduling of data transfer.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage, which is a specific method of exfiltration but does not mention scheduling.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for ensuring the scheduled transfer of collected data is **T1029-Scheduled Transfer**. This technique specifically addresses the scheduling aspect of data exfiltration, which aligns with the requirement to transfer data every 10 minutes.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: **T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
