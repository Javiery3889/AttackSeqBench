### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where spear-phishing emails are used for initial access, followed by the deployment of custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs (Remote Access Trojans) by the threat actors Moafee and DragonOK.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves using spear-phishing with links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates:** This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malware, which is not directly related to the deployment of backdoors and RATs after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities:** This technique involves obtaining tools, such as backdoors and RATs, which aligns with the described activity of deploying custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement:** This technique involves defacing internal systems, which is not relevant to the deployment of backdoors and RATs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial access method, but it does not describe the subsequent deployment of tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by **Answer Choice B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**. This technique aligns with the activity of ensuring the deployment of custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs to support the campaigns.

**Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
