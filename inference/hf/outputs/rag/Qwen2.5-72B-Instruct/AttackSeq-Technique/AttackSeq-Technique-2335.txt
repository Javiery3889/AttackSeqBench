### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Cinobi uses form-grabbing and web traffic modification to steal banking credentials.
   - After stealing the credentials, it communicates with its C&C server over the Tor proxy to download additional malware stages and configuration files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking browser sessions to collect data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the communication path.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1542.002-Component Firmware** - This technique involves modifying firmware to maintain persistence. It is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server over a proxy.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with a C&C server, which aligns with the scenario described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS** - This technique involves using fast flux DNS to obfuscate the location of the C&C server. While it is a method to hide the C&C server, it is not specifically about using a proxy.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. It is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server over a proxy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1090-Proxy**.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
