### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where ZoxPNG establishes communication with a C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files.
   - It then asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other files, such as PNG files, to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves directly interacting with the operating system's API to perform actions. While this could be part of the malware's functionality, it does not specifically describe the communication and command dispatch loop.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for communication. This aligns with the initial part of the question where ZoxPNG uses HTTP GET and POST requests.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow:** This technique involves credential dumping from specific files on Unix-like systems. This is not relevant to the communication and command dispatch loop.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:** This is a duplicate of Answer Choice A and has the same evaluation.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for the communication and command dispatch loop is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique describes the use of HTTP for communication, which is consistent with the initial part of the question where ZoxPNG uses HTTP GET and POST requests.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
