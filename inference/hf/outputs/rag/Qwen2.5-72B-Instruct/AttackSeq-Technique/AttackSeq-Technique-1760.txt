### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious document with a custom Pterodo backdoor is used for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, Shuckworm executes VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Execution" and the Technique is "T1059.005-Visual Basic."
   - This suggests that the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files is part of the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft**
     - This technique involves stealing financial data, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence or execution.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
     - This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code at specific times, which is another common method for maintaining persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Both B (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) and D (T1053-Scheduled Task/Job) are techniques used for maintaining persistence.
   - However, given that the question specifically mentions the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files, which are often used to set up scheduled tasks, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is the most plausible choice.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
