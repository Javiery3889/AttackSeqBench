### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where CosmicDuke uses Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on network and hard drives, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names.
   - After this, CosmicDuke gathers information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices, which can include removable drives.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths, which can help in locating specific files on the network and hard drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1127.002-ClickOnce**
     - This technique involves using ClickOnce deployment to execute malicious code. It does not align with the described sequence of gathering information from removable drives.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
     - This technique involves intercepting and capturing credentials through API hooking. It does not align with the described sequence of gathering information from removable drives.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates. It does not align with the described sequence of gathering information from removable drives.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns perfectly with the described sequence where CosmicDuke gathers information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1025-Data from Removable Media**.

**Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
