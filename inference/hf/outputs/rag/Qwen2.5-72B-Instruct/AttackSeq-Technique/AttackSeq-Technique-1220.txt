### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses Mimikatz for credential theft and copies the NTDS.DIT database file during the Credential Access phase.
   - The next step is to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the exfiltration of compressed proprietary data to Dropbox using the cURL command-line tool.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves using tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials from the NTDS.DIT file.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services like Dropbox.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1213.003-Code Repositories:** This technique involves using code repositories to store and manage code. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data or the credential access phase.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While it is related to credential access, it is not the most likely step immediately before exfiltration.
   - **C: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems. It is typically used in the initial stages of an attack and is not directly related to the exfiltration phase.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration. This is a logical step before exfiltration, as compressing data can make it easier to transfer and less noticeable.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before the exfiltration of compressed proprietary data to Dropbox is **T1560-Archive Collected Data**.

**Final Answer: D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
