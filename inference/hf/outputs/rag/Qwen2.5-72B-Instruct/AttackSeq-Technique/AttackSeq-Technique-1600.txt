### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where FastPOS uses keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK technique under the Collection tactic was likely used before the stolen credit card information was transmitted to the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial data collection.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files, databases, and other local storage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. While it can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the collection of stolen credit card information.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard. While it can be used to collect sensitive information, it is not typically used in the context of credit card information theft after keylogging and RAM scraping.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While it is a valuable technique for gaining further access, it is not directly related to the collection of credit card information.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which can include keylogging. However, the question already mentions keylogging, so this choice seems redundant. However, it is worth noting that input capture can also include other forms of data collection, such as screen scraping or form grabbing, which could be relevant in the context of collecting credit card information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the question already mentions keylogging and RAM scraping, the most plausible next step in the Collection tactic would be to collect data from the local system (T1005) to ensure all relevant information is gathered before transmission.
   - However, since the question specifically asks for the technique that follows keylogging and RAM scraping, and considering the context of credit card information, the most likely technique is **T1056-Input Capture** (D), which can include additional forms of data collection beyond keylogging.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
