### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals use leaked-data search engines and forums to gather intelligence during the reconnaissance phase.
   - After this, they acquire new PoS and ATM skimmers, along with social engineering toolkits for social engineering attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1593.002-Search Engines:** This technique involves using search engines to gather information, which is also part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using a service to conduct spearphishing attacks, which is a form of social engineering.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1597-Search Closed Sources**
     - This technique involves searching closed sources for information, which is similar to using leaked-data search engines and forums. However, it does not cover the acquisition of tools and skimmers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
     - This technique involves acquiring tools, capabilities, and resources to support the attack. This aligns well with the acquisition of PoS and ATM skimmers, as well as social engineering toolkits.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up persistence mechanisms, which is not relevant to the reconnaissance or acquisition phase described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584.005-Botnet**
     - This technique involves using a botnet, which is not relevant to the reconnaissance or acquisition phase described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the acquisition of tools and capabilities, which is covered by **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**.

**Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
