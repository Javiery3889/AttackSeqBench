### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Tropic Trooper used an exploit in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, the backdoor's installer was deployed, and this deployment required user action or interaction.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This sub-technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which then leads to the execution of the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. It does not fit the context of user interaction to deploy a backdoor.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves hiding data in the resource fork of a file, which is not relevant to user interaction for deploying a backdoor.
   - **T1648-Serverless Execution:** This technique involves executing code without a traditional server, which does not fit the context of user interaction.
   - **T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, which aligns with the scenario where user action or interaction is required to deploy the backdoor.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of user interaction to deploy the backdoor, is **T1204-User Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution**
