### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker gains initial access through document-based exploits, executes malware using an updated MiniDuke loader, and then steals credentials and exports certificates with private keys.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the credential theft and certificate export.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique involves stealing private keys, which aligns with the part of the question about exporting certificates with private keys.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for future use, which is relevant to the credential theft part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL:** This technique involves installing a password filter DLL to capture credentials as they are entered. While this could be used to steal credentials, it is more of a persistent method and less likely to be the immediate step before exporting certificates.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is a direct method of credential theft and aligns well with the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. While this could be used to maintain persistence or execute the malware, it is not directly related to the credential theft or certificate export.
   - **D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:** This technique involves using one-way communication channels, which is not directly related to credential theft or certificate export.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker, after gaining initial access and executing the malware, would use a technique to directly steal credentials from password stores (T1555) before proceeding to export certificates with private keys (T1552.004).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
