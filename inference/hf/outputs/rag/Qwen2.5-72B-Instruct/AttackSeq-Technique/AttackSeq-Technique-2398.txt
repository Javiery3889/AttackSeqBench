### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities where TDrop2 evaded detection using process hollowing and disguised payload retrieval.
   - The next step in the sequence is to gather details about the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial tactic was **Defense Evasion** using the technique **T1055.012-Process Hollowing**.
   - This suggests that the malware has successfully evaded detection and is now likely to perform reconnaissance on the infected system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about gathering system information.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. This aligns well with the need to gather details about the infected system.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is about detecting and evading virtualized environments and sandboxes. While it is a form of defense evasion, it is not directly about gathering system information.
   - **D: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves compressing data using a library. It is not related to gathering system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the need to gather details about the infected system, the most plausible answer is **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
