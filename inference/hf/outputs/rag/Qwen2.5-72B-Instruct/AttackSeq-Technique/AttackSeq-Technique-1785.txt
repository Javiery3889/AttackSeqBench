### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is about the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure after PowerShell scripts were used to load additional payloads and scripts from a command-and-control (C2) server.
   - The focus is on maintaining the persistence of the fileless in-memory payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from a C2 server to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique is about using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While it is relevant to the initial execution of PowerShell scripts, it does not directly address the continuous operation of the payload.
   - **B: T1137.003-Outlook Forms:** This technique involves using Outlook forms to execute code. It is not directly related to maintaining the persistence of a fileless in-memory payload.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. This is a common method for maintaining persistence, which is crucial for the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload.
   - **D: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type:** This technique involves disguising files to appear as legitimate files. While it can be used to avoid detection, it does not directly address the continuous operation of the payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for maintaining the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure is **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**. This technique ensures that the payload is executed every time the system boots or a user logs on, maintaining persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
