### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to hide the 'mothership' control server's location in the 'Red October' campaign.
   - The key points are:
     - Communication with C&C servers.
     - Hiding the location of the 'mothership' control server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server to obscure the true destination.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication methods if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. It is not directly related to hiding the location of a C&C server.
   - **B: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the DLL search order to load a malicious DLL. It is not related to C&C communication or hiding server locations.
   - **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving C&C server addresses to avoid detection. This could be relevant to hiding the location of the 'mothership' control server.
   - **D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for C&C communication. While it can be used for communication, it does not specifically address hiding the server's location.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** is the most relevant technique for hiding the location of the 'mothership' control server. It involves dynamically resolving the C&C server addresses, which can help in obscuring the true location of the control server.
   - The related TTPs, particularly **T1090-Proxy** and **T1071.004-DNS**, also support the idea of using dynamic resolution to hide the server's location.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
