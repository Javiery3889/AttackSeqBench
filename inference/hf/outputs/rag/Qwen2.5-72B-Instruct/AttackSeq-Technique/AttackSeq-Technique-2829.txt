### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where BlackSoul collects specified files, updates its configuration file, and then exfiltrates data over the C2 channel using automated methods.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1037.002-Login Hook:** This technique involves modifying the login process to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters:** This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. This could be a plausible step before exfiltration to make the data less detectable.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable during exfiltration. This is a common step before exfiltration to ensure the data is not easily identifiable.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Both C (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) and D (T1132-Data Encoding) are plausible steps that could occur before exfiltration.
   - However, T1132-Data Encoding is more directly related to the exfiltration process, as it specifically involves encoding data to make it less detectable during transmission.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is more about making the files themselves less detectable, which might be a step taken earlier in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding
