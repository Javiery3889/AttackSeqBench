### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers:
     - Evade detection by bypassing process-level restrictions.
     - Inject malicious code into trusted processes using the AtomBombing technique.
     - Execute malicious code by leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process using asynchronous procedure calls (APCs), which can be used to execute code in the context of another process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to evade detection and execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053.003-Cron**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using cron jobs, which is specific to Unix-like systems and not relevant to the Windows operating system mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking dynamic libraries (dylibs) on macOS, which is not relevant to the Windows operating system mechanisms described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly calling native APIs, which can be used to execute code, but it does not specifically describe the injection of code into trusted processes using atom tables.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which aligns with the description of using the AtomBombing technique to inject malicious code into trusted processes and execute it using Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1055-Process Injection**.

**Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection**
