### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Mustang Panda used execution methods involving benign executables to side-load malicious DLLs for deploying the PlugX implant.
   - The key points are:
     - Execution methods involving benign executables.
     - Side-loading malicious DLLs.
     - Deploying the PlugX implant.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
   - These TTPs indicate that DLL side-loading is a significant technique used by Mustang Panda for various purposes, including privilege escalation, persistence, and defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up programs to run automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the side-loading of DLLs.
   - **B: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**
     - This technique involves running scripts when a user logs on to a network. It is not directly related to the side-loading of DLLs or the deployment of the PlugX implant.
   - **C: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the side-loading of DLLs.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules (DLLs) to load and execute malicious code. This is directly related to the side-loading of DLLs, which is a key part of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after side-loading the malicious DLLs, Mustang Panda used shared modules to execute the PlugX implant.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
