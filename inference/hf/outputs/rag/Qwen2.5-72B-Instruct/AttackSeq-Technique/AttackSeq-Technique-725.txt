### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in Operation Sharpshooter.
   - The sequence includes establishing persistence by placing a second-stage binary in the startup folder.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is Privilege Escalation and Persistence.
   - The specific technique mentioned is T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is used for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell for command execution. While it could be used for various purposes, it is not specifically tied to the sequence of events described.
   - **B: T1012-Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves querying the registry, which could be used to gather information about the system. However, it is not directly related to the communication with control servers.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks:**
     - This technique involves performing system checks, which could be used to ensure the system is in a state where the implant can function. This is a plausible step before communication.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:**
     - This technique involves gathering identity information, which is more related to reconnaissance and not directly to the communication with control servers.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence would involve ensuring the system is in a state where the implant can function before attempting to communicate with control servers.
   - **T1497.001-System Checks** fits this context well, as it would ensure the system is ready for the implant to communicate.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1497.001-System Checks
