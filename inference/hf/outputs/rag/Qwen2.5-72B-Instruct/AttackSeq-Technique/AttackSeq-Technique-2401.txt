### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where TDrop2 malware retrieves a second-stage payload disguised as an image file to evade security mechanisms.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the reconnaissance phase to collect information about specific paths on the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type:** This technique involves disguising files to appear as legitimate files, which aligns with the malware retrieving a payload disguised as an image file.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to control the malware, which is relevant to the retrieval of a second-stage payload.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This is a broader technique that includes disguising files and processes to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from the infected system, which is not relevant to the reconnaissance phase of collecting information about specific paths.
   - **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on the infected system, which is directly relevant to the reconnaissance phase of collecting information about specific paths.
   - **C: T1069.002-Domain Groups:** This technique involves discovering domain groups, which is not directly related to the reconnaissance of file and directory paths.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection, which is more relevant to the defense evasion phase rather than the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the malware using T1083-File and Directory Discovery to collect information about specific paths on the infected system during the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
