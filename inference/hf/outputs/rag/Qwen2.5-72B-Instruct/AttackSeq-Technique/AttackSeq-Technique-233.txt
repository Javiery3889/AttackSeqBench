### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file is used to install the main payload.
   - The key point is that the malware executes the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**
   - Both TTPs are related to bypassing UAC, which is a mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. It does not directly relate to bypassing UAC.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This is a broader category that includes techniques for bypassing UAC. However, it is not specific enough to the context of the question.
   - **C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
     - AppInit DLLs are a technique used to load a DLL into every user application, which can be used for persistence and execution of code. It does not directly relate to bypassing UAC.
   - **D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**
     - This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not relevant to the context of bypassing UAC.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique to the scenario described in the question is **T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**. This technique is directly related to the ability to execute the payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism

However, for the most precise answer, the specific sub-technique **T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control** should be noted. Since the answer choices do not include this specific sub-technique, the closest and most relevant choice is **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**.
