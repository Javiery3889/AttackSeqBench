### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before Suckfly achieved execution using the Nidiran backdoor and other tools signed with stolen digital certificates.
   - The key points are:
     - Suckfly achieved execution.
     - They used the Nidiran backdoor.
     - They used hacktools and malware signed with stolen digital certificates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
     - This technique involves using stolen or legitimate digital certificates to sign malware, making it appear more trustworthy and evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. It is often used as an initial access vector.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is typically used after gaining initial access to escalate privileges.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up a mechanism to execute code when a specific event occurs, which is useful for persistence and maintaining access.
   - **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
     - This is a more targeted form of phishing that uses a service (like email) to deliver the payload. It is also an initial access vector.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that Suckfly used the Nidiran backdoor and signed malware, the initial access vector is crucial. Phishing, especially spearphishing, is a common method to gain initial access.
   - **T1566-Phishing** and **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service** are both plausible, but **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service** is more specific and targeted, which aligns better with the sophisticated nature of Suckfly's operations.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping** and **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** are more likely to occur after initial access has been gained, not before.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
