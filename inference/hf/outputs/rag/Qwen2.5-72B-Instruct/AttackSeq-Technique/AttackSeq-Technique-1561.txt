### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a supply chain attack on NoxPlayer.
   - After gaining initial access, the malware execution flow was altered to hide the dialog and avoid displaying on the Windows Taskbar to simulate user interaction.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique is used to gain initial access by compromising a third-party software supply chain.
   - **T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a task or service to appear legitimate to avoid detection.
   - **T1564.003-Hidden Window:** This technique involves hiding a window to avoid detection by the user or security software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547.010-Port Monitors:** This technique involves modifying port monitors to execute arbitrary code. It does not align with the described sequence of hiding a window.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique is already mentioned as the initial access method and does not describe the subsequent action of hiding the window.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules to load malicious code. It does not directly relate to hiding a window.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While it could be used to hide a window, it is not as specific as T1564.003.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for hiding a window to avoid detection is **T1564.003-Hidden Window**. This aligns with the described action of altering the malware execution flow to hide the dialog and avoid displaying on the Windows Taskbar.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API

However, based on the most specific and relevant technique, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: T1564.003-Hidden Window

But since T1564.003 is not listed as an answer choice, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
