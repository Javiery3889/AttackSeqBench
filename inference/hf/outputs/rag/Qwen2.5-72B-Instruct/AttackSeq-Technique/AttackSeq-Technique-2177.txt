### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker spoofs Taiwanese government email addresses and sends socially engineered emails leading to the execution of malicious documents.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Taidoor exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - This suggests that the initial step in the attack sequence involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, not the initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**
     - This technique involves re-opening applications to maintain persistence, which is also a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves phishing, which aligns with the described sequence of sending socially engineered emails with malicious attachments. Specifically, T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is a sub-technique of T1566.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attacker used spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access before exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
