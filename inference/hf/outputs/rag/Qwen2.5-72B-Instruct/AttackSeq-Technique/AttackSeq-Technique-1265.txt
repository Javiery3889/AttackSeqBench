### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a PowerShell script decrypts registry contents and executes a new script, leading to the establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool (RAT).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell (Execution Tactic):** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Defense Evasion Tactic):** This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating data to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels (Command and Control Tactic):** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails. This is not directly related to the execution or decoding of scripts.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol (Command and Control Tactic):** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a command and control server. This is a plausible next step after establishing a RAT.
   - **C: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography (Command and Control Tactic):** This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to secure communications. While it could be used in the context of a RAT, it is not the most immediate next step after establishing the RAT.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules (Execution Tactic):** This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. This is more related to the initial execution phase rather than the communication phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible next step after the PowerShell script decrypts the registry contents and executes a new script to establish njRAT is to set up communication with the command and control server. This is best represented by **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
