### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime to execute tasks.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to maintain the Trojan's presence across reboots, specifically under paths such as `%systemroot%\system32` or `%programfiles%`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location that will be searched before the legitimate DLL, allowing the malicious DLL to be loaded and executed.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into the memory of a running process to execute code in the context of that process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying a system process to maintain persistence. While this could be used to maintain the Trojan's presence, it does not specifically address the dynamic loading of a DLL or the placement of the DLL in system directories.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1110-Brute Force:** This technique involves attempting to guess credentials to gain unauthorized access. It is not relevant to maintaining persistence or dynamic DLL loading.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules to load and execute code. While it is related to dynamic loading, it does not specifically address the persistence aspect of placing the DLL in system directories.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager:** This technique involves using the AppDomainManager to load and execute code in the context of a .NET application. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence or dynamic DLL loading in system directories.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining the Trojan's presence across reboots by placing a malicious DLL in system directories is **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**. This technique aligns with the scenario described in the question, where the Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL and places it in system directories to ensure it is loaded and executed on reboot.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**

However, based on the related TTPs and the specific context of the question, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant technique based on the given context.) 

Given the provided choices, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
