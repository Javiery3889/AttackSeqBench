### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the LURK malware:
     - Maintained persistence by creating a link in the Startup folder.
     - Leveraged associated files in the %AppData%\Help directory.
     - Communicated with its command-and-control (C2) server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves creating a link in the Startup folder to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves using dynamic DNS (DDNS) to resolve C2 server addresses, which can change frequently to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves hiding the nature of the malware by obfuscating files or information. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly relate to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it could be used in communication, it is not the primary method described in the question.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to communicate with the C2 server. This aligns well with the use of dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.
   - **D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood:**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with requests to cause a denial of service. This does not fit the context of the question, which is about communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of standard application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
