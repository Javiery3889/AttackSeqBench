### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to Harvester's use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront for command and control activities.
   - The key points are:
     - Execution of commands and capturing user activities using Backdoor.Graphon.
     - Harvester's use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain command and control.
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with the command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the command and control server. While it is related to command and control, it is too broad and does not specifically align with the use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1546.005-Trap**
     - This technique involves setting up a trap to capture user activities, which is not directly related to command and control activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving collected data, which is a post-exploitation activity and not directly related to command and control.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with the command and control server. This aligns well with the use of Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront, which are web services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Harvester used web protocols (T1071.001) to communicate with the command and control server before utilizing Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront.

**Final Answer: D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
