### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access via CVE-2017-11882 and before the establishment of persistence using a Run key and a PowerShell script in the %AppData% directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves setting a registry run key or placing a file in a startup folder to achieve persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. However, the question already states that the initial access was via CVE-2017-11882, which is a client-side vulnerability, not a public-facing application.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute code. This is a plausible step between initial access and persistence, as the attackers might use a command-line interface to set up the persistence mechanism.
   - **C: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This sub-technique involves using Visual Basic for scripting. While it is a scripting language, it is not as commonly used for the specific scenario described.
   - **D: T1218.014-MMC:** This sub-technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for execution. This is less likely to be used in the context of setting up persistence with a PowerShell script.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access via CVE-2017-11882, the attackers used a command-line interface or scripting to set up the persistence mechanism. The use of a PowerShell script in the %AppData% directory strongly suggests the use of a command-line interface or scripting to achieve this.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
