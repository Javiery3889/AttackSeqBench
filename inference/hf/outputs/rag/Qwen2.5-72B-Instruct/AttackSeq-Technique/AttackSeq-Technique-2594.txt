### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion and then gathers detailed system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the technique is **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. It does not align with the scenario of gathering system information after defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about network connections, which matches the described action of gathering detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not relevant to the scenario of gathering local system network information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
     - This technique involves creating autostart entries to maintain persistence, which is not related to the discovery of system network information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described, the most plausible answer is **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**.

Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
