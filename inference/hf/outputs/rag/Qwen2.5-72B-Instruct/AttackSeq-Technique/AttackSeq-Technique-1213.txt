### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that PyFlash gathered system and network information for discovery and sent it to a C&C server.
   - The key points are:
     - **Discovery**: Gathering system and network information.
     - **Exfiltration**: Sending the gathered information to a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system itself.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique is part of the discovery phase and involves gathering system information, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, which does not align with the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves sending data to a C&C server, which aligns with the second part of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
     - This technique involves sending data over a physical medium, which does not align with the context of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is that after gathering system and network information (discovery), the information was sent to a C&C server (exfiltration).
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

Final Answer: **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
