### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access phase where the attackers used spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks with malicious RTF and Excel files to exploit known vulnerabilities.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers executed malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy along with RATs (Remote Access Trojans).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves placing malicious code in a location that the target is likely to visit, such as a compromised website.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments to specific individuals or groups.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.009-Cloud API:** This technique involves using cloud-based APIs to execute commands. It is not directly related to the execution of Trojans and RATs after initial access.
   - **B: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information. It is not directly related to the execution of Trojans and RATs.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting client-side applications (like web browsers, document readers, etc.) to execute malicious code. This aligns well with the use of Trojans and RATs after gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves using messaging applications to execute commands. It is not directly related to the execution of Trojans and RATs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**. This technique aligns with the execution of Trojans and RATs after gaining initial access through spear-phishing and drive-by compromises.

**Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
