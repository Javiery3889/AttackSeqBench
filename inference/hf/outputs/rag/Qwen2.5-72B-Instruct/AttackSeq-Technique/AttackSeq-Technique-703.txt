### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through the exploitation of the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - After gaining initial access, the threat actor (TA505) attempts to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique is used to gain initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the exploitation of the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This is a broad category that includes the use of scheduled tasks for various purposes, including persistence and privilege escalation. Given the context of hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup, this is a strong candidate.
   - **B: T1590.005-IP Addresses:** This technique involves the use of IP addresses, which is not directly related to the hijacking of a scheduled task.
   - **C: T1559.003-XPC Services:** This technique involves using XPC (Cross-Process Communication) services, which is not directly related to the hijacking of a scheduled task.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts, which is not directly related to the hijacking of a scheduled task.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant technique for hijacking a scheduled task to maintain access is T1053.005-Scheduled Task. This aligns with the persistence and privilege escalation tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - The broader category T1053-Scheduled Task/Job (Choice A) is the most appropriate answer as it encompasses the specific technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
