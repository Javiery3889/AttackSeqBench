### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker exploits a legitimate software update process for defense evasion and then exfiltrates personal details of millions of SK Communications customers.
   - The focus is on identifying the technique that facilitated attacker communication with the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. While it can be used for exfiltration, it is not typically used for C2 communication.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This technique involves intercepting and capturing credentials by hooking into API calls. It is not related to C2 communication.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) for C2 communication. This aligns well with the related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols.
   - **D: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting a legitimate software update process to evade defenses. While it is part of the attack sequence, it does not facilitate C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique for facilitating C2 communication is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
