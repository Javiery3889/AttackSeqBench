### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer, including the Microsoft Office version, before the initial access via spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment." This suggests that the initial access was achieved through spear phishing emails with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad category that includes various types of phishing techniques. While it is related to the initial access, it does not specifically address the gathering of software details.
   - **B: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information from the victim. It is more specific to the context of gathering details about the victim's environment, including software versions.
   - **C: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data:** This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not relevant to the context of gathering information through phishing.
   - **D: T1648-Serverless Execution:** This technique involves executing code without a server, which is not relevant to the context of gathering information about the victim's software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique used to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer is **T1598-Phishing for Information**.

Final Answer: B: T1598-Phishing for Information
