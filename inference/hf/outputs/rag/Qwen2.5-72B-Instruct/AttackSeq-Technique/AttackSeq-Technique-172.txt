### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before 'Surtr' connects to a command and control (C2) server and downloads a stage two component to a specific directory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While it can be an initial access vector, it is not directly related to the command and control (C2) communication or the transfer of tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - Deploying a container is a technique used to run applications in isolated environments. It is not directly related to C2 communication or the transfer of tools.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
     - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. While it can be used in C2 communication, it is not specifically about transferring tools or establishing a multi-stage channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. It is directly related to the C2 communication and the transfer of tools, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**.

**Final Answer: D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
