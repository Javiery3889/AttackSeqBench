### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT42:
     - Conducted reconnaissance by browsing compromised user contacts and accessing organizational collaborative spaces.
     - Escalated privileges using custom malware for keylogging and cookie data theft.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites:**
     - This technique involves searching for information on victim-owned websites to gather intelligence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1040-Network Sniffing:**
     - Network sniffing involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. This could be used for reconnaissance but is not typically a step between reconnaissance and privilege escalation.
   - **B: T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate:**
     - Installing a digital certificate is more related to establishing trust and could be used for maintaining access or exfiltration, but it is not a typical step between reconnaissance and privilege escalation.
   - **C: T1098-Account Manipulation:**
     - Account manipulation involves altering user accounts to maintain access or escalate privileges. This is a plausible step between reconnaissance and privilege escalation, as it can be used to prepare for or facilitate privilege escalation.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture:**
     - Input capture involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or credentials. This is more related to the final step of privilege escalation using keylogging and cookie data theft, but it is not typically a step between reconnaissance and privilege escalation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that occurred between reconnaissance and privilege escalation is **T1098-Account Manipulation**. This technique aligns with the context of preparing for or facilitating privilege escalation after gathering initial reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
