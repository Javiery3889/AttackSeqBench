### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a macro-enabled Word document is used to execute "vba_macro.exe" in memory.
   - The focus is on what happens after the execution of "vba_macro.exe."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute commands. In this context, the macro-enabled Word document is using VB to execute "vba_macro.exe" in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. It is not directly related to the immediate execution of "vba_macro.exe" in memory.
   - **B: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. It is not relevant to the immediate execution of "vba_macro.exe" in memory.
   - **C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process using Image File Execution Options (IFEO). It is a method for persistence and can be used after initial execution, but it is not the most immediate next step after running "vba_macro.exe" in memory.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application communication, such as raw sockets or ICMP. It is not directly related to the immediate execution of "vba_macro.exe" in memory.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the macro-enabled Word document is using VB to execute "vba_macro.exe" in memory, the most immediate next step would be to establish a communication channel with a C2 server or perform further actions in memory.
   - However, none of the provided answer choices directly describe an immediate next step in memory execution. The closest relevant technique is **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**, which could be used for persistence after the initial execution.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection
