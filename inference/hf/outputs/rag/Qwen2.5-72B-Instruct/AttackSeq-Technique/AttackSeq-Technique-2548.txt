### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Milestone backdoor sent session information to the C2 server over an uncompressed communication channel.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Milestone backdoor**: A type of malware.
     - **Session information**: Data collected during the session.
     - **C2 server**: Command and Control server.
     - **Uncompressed communication channel**: The data is sent without compression.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves the exfiltration of data from a compromised system to a C2 server over a communication channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into a web application or service. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering software installed on a system. While it can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This is directly related to the communication channel used for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**
     - This technique involves using rootkits to hide the presence of malware. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the Milestone backdoor used an application layer protocol (T1071) to communicate with the C2 server before exfiltrating the session information.
   - T1071 is the technique that directly supports the communication channel used for exfiltration, which aligns with the related TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
