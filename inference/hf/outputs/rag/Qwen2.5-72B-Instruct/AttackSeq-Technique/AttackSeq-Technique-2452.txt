### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Elise malware uses defense evasion techniques, communicates with a hardcoded C2 server, and then harvests extensive system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with the C2 server, which aligns with the malware communicating with a hardcoded C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data back to the C2 server, which is a logical next step after harvesting system information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, which aligns with the malware harvesting extensive system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. While this could be part of the discovery process, it is more specific to file and directory information rather than extensive system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network configuration details. This is a subset of system information but is more specific to network-related details.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using resource forks to hide data, which is more related to defense evasion rather than system information discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is more related to the C2 communication rather than system information discovery.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most comprehensive and relevant technique for harvesting extensive system information is **T1082-System Information Discovery**. This technique aligns with the malware's need to gather detailed information about the system after evading defenses and establishing C2 communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**

However, based on the most comprehensive and relevant technique for harvesting extensive system information, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1082-System Information Discovery** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most accurate based on the context.) 

Given the provided choices, the closest and most relevant answer is:

Final Answer: **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
