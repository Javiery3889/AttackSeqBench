### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Lazarus group used a credential harvesting tool named Responder to acquire login credentials.
   - The focus is on what happens after the credentials are harvested.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to extract credentials or other sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves manipulating network protocols to capture and relay authentication requests to gain access to credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the immediate actions following credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate or likely action after credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves adversaries disguising the true nature of their activities, such as by renaming files or processes. This could be a subsequent step to avoid detection after credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This is a duplicate of Answer Choice B and has the same evaluation.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most immediate and likely action after credential harvesting is to use the credentials to gain further access or to discover more about the system. However, the most relevant and immediate action in the context of the related TTPs is to use the credentials to perform network sniffing or to manipulate network protocols to capture more credentials or relay them for further access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**

However, given the context of the related TTPs, a more precise and immediate action would be to use the credentials for network sniffing or LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning. Since these are not listed as answer choices, the most plausible choice from the given options is:

Final Answer: **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
