### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder and before it communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with control servers.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves ensuring persistence by placing a binary in the startup folder or registry run keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves checking for an active internet connection. While this could be relevant, it is not a necessary step between ensuring persistence and communicating with control servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting to execute commands. This could be relevant if the second-stage binary needs to execute additional commands, but it is not a necessary step between ensuring persistence and communicating with control servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration. This could be relevant if the implant needs to understand the network environment before communicating with control servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves network poisoning and relay attacks, which are not typically used in the context of ensuring persistence or communicating with control servers.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after ensuring persistence by placing the second-stage binary in the startup folder, the implant would likely gather information about the system's network configuration to understand the environment before attempting to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
