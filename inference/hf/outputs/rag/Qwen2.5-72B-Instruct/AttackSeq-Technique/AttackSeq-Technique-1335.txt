### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the RAT malware communicated with the C2 servers by encrypting data using AES and base64 encoding.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
     - It communicates with C2 servers.
     - It uses AES encryption and base64 encoding for data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to network defenses.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:**
     - This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It is not directly related to the encoding or encryption of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate remote services to gain access to a system. It is not directly related to the encoding or encryption of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to network defenses. The sub-technique T1132.001-Standard Encoding is specifically mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the use of base64 encoding.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1608-Stage Capabilities:**
     - This technique involves preparing and staging capabilities for future use. It is not directly related to the encoding or encryption of data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware first encodes the data using base64 encoding (T1132.001-Standard Encoding) before it communicates with the C2 servers. This aligns with the related TTPs and the question's context.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
