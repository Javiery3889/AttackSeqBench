### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the Welcome Chat app targeting Arabic-speaking Android users through a dedicated website. It then asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred after the initial targeting but before ensuring the app's functionality was activated every time the device started.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not directly relevant to the initial access or persistence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a website, which aligns with the initial targeting of users through a dedicated website.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves ensuring that the app is activated every time the device starts, which aligns with the final step in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the location of the system, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1593.001-Social Media:** This technique involves using social media for initial access, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This is a duplicate of Answer Choice C and is not relevant.

   The most relevant technique from the related TTPs is **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**, which fits the sequence of events described in the question. After the initial targeting through a dedicated website, the next logical step would be to compromise the user's system through a drive-by attack.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
