### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where OnionDog used the Hangul software vulnerability to transmit malware to network-isolated targets.
   - The method of transmission was through replication via removable media to achieve initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the technique used for initial access and lateral movement is T1091-Replication Through Removable Media.
   - This technique is listed under both the Initial Access and Lateral Movement tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1535-Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions**
     - This technique involves using cloud regions that are not actively monitored or supported. It is not relevant to the described scenario of using removable media for initial access.
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing to gain initial access. It is not relevant to the described scenario of using removable media.
   - **C: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**
     - This technique involves techniques to bridge network boundaries, which could be relevant in a broader context but does not specifically align with the use of removable media for initial access.
   - **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique directly aligns with the described scenario. It involves using removable media to transmit malware to network-isolated targets, which is exactly what the question describes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly matches the described method of initial access and lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
