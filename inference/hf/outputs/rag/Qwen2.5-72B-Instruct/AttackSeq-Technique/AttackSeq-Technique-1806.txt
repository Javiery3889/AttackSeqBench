### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker exploits the Equation Editor vulnerability to drop the 'intel.wll' file, which is used to maintain persistence in Microsoft Word. The next step in the infection chain involves downloading and decrypting subsequent stages from a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to achieve persistence.
   - **T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using Microsoft Office add-ins to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up a mechanism to execute code at system boot or user logon. While it is a persistence technique, it is not directly related to the specific context of maintaining persistence in Microsoft Word.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols for communication. It is not relevant to the context of maintaining persistence or the initial exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it is related to the initial exploitation, it does not fit the context of maintaining persistence in Microsoft Word.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1205.002-Socket Filters:**
     - This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not relevant to the context of maintaining persistence in Microsoft Word.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining persistence in Microsoft Word, as described in the question, is **T1137.006-Add-ins**. This technique involves using Microsoft Office add-ins to ensure that the malware is executed every time Microsoft Word is launched.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1137.006-Add-ins**
