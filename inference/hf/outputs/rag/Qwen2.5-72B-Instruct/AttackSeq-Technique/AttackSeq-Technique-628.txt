### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a VB Script is used to extract and execute a payload delivered via a malicious HTA file during the initial access phase.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VB) for scripting and executing code. It aligns with the use of a VB Script to extract and execute the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1011-Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a network medium other than the command and control channel. It is typically used later in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has gained access and performed other actions.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions. While it can be used during the execution phase, it is not the most likely next step after the initial payload execution.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. Since the initial access has already been achieved via the malicious HTA file, this is not a likely next step.
   - **D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a later time. This is a common next step after initial execution to ensure persistence and maintain access to the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after the initial execution of the payload via a VB Script is to create a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is **D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**.

Final Answer: **D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
