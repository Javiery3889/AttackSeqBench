### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Elise malware establishes persistence by modifying the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
   - After establishing persistence, the malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the registry to evade detection or maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding or modifying registry run keys to ensure the malware runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection in virtualized or sandboxed environments. It does not align with the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions to modify services. It does not align with the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it could be relevant, it is not the most specific or likely choice given the context.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. This aligns well with the described communication to send harvested data and receive commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the malware communicating with a C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands, is the use of standard application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
