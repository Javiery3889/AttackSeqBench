### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through a spear phishing email containing a spreadsheet with a malicious macro.
   - The macro downloads and executes malicious files, initiating the infection chain.
   - We need to determine the next ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the macro executed the malicious files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This sub-technique specifically involves using a spear phishing email with an attachment to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1569.002-Service Execution**: This technique involves executing a program via a service. This is not typically the next step after a macro downloads and executes malicious files.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file. This is part of the initial access phase, not the next step after the macro execution.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions. This is not a common next step after a macro execution.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up a program to execute automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and executing a malicious payload to ensure persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after the macro downloads and executes malicious files is to set up persistence. Therefore, the most likely technique is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
