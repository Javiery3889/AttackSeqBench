### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Tropic Trooper backdoor:
     - Decrypted its configuration file.
     - Connected using the SSL protocol.
     - Leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoor leveraged custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using standard web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to avoid detection.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication to avoid detection by network security devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**
     - This technique involves using a service to send spearphishing emails. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question, which focuses on the backdoor's communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. Given that the backdoor is using SSL (a form of encrypted communication), this technique is highly relevant.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1001.002-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other data to avoid detection. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not directly related to the SSL communication described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malware. It is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor first established an encrypted channel (T1573) before leveraging custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server. This is because establishing an encrypted channel is a necessary step before using custom SSL libraries for secure communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
