### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes discovery activities such as network share and process discovery.
   - The next step in the sequence involves using compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management:**
     - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote access and command execution.
     - It is a method for lateral movement and remote control, which could logically follow discovery activities and precede the use of compromised router virtual machines.
   - **B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.
     - While this could be part of the attack sequence, it is more likely to occur after gaining initial access and before or during the use of compromised router virtual machines.
   - **C: T1587.004-Exploits:**
     - This technique involves using exploits to gain initial access or elevate privileges.
     - It is typically used at the beginning of an attack sequence, not after discovery activities.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
     - It is typically used to cover tracks after the main attack activities have been completed, not as a step in the middle of the attack sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1021.006-Windows Remote Management** (Answer A) is the most plausible choice because it fits logically between the discovery activities and the use of compromised router virtual machines. After discovering network services and file directories, the attackers would likely use a method like WinRM to move laterally and gain control over the network, which would then allow them to use the compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management
