### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access scenario where the Inception Framework exploited RTF files using vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-1761.
   - The focus is on the technique used to facilitate communication with the cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control (C2) operations after gaining initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a common method for establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code through phishing emails or links. While it can be used for initial access, it is not typically used for C2 communication.
   - **C: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication. It is more focused on data exfiltration rather than command and control.
   - **D: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel with a C2 server, which is essential for maintaining control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is a common and effective method for establishing C2 communication, especially over standard protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** is also a strong candidate as it specifically mentions bidirectional communication, which is crucial for C2 operations.
   - However, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is more specific to the use of standard protocols, which are often used in cloud-based C2 infrastructure.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
