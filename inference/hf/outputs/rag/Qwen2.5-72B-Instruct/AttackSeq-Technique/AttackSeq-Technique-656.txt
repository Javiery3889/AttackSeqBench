### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory and gained initial access to the victim's device using malicious Office documents.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves gaining initial access to a victim's device by sending a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route network traffic. This is not directly related to the execution of commands or the initial access method described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access and executing commands in memory.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical media, which is not relevant to the initial access or command execution described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial access method, so it is not a subsequent step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access and executing commands in memory using the DDE protocol, the attacker would likely use a command and scripting interpreter to further execute commands and maintain control.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
