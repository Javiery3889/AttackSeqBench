### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the XAgent app collects sensitive information from an iOS device and then uploads the collected data to a C2 server using FTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) to transfer files between the compromised system and the attacker's server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process described.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:** This technique involves using fast-flux DNS to hide the location of C2 servers, which is not directly related to file transfer.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms to gain higher privileges, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most relevant technique for uploading files via FTP to a C2 server is **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**. This technique directly aligns with the use of FTP for file transfer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

**Correction:**
Upon re-evaluation, the most appropriate answer is actually **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**. However, since this is not one of the provided answer choices, the closest and most relevant choice is **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**, but it is not the most accurate. The correct answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols** (if it were an option, but since it is not, the closest is D).
