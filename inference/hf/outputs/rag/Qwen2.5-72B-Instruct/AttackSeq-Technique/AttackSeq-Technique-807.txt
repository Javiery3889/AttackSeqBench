### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where victims are lured with a spear-phishing email to download a compressed malicious Windows shortcut file.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before GOLDBACKDOOR utilized a multi-stage process and obfuscated PowerShell scripts to bypass antivirus detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into executing a malicious file.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the use of phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves the use of spear-phishing with a link to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves loading a DLL into every process that loads user32.dll. This is not directly related to the initial access or the obfuscation of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is a broad category that includes various forms of phishing, including spear-phishing. It is relevant to the initial access phase but does not specifically address the obfuscation of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070.010-Relocate Malware:** This technique involves moving malware to a different location on the system. This is not directly related to the initial access or the obfuscation of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of files or scripts. This is directly relevant to the use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts to bypass antivirus detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the spear-phishing email (T1566.002) led to the download of a malicious file (T1204.002), and then the obfuscation of PowerShell scripts (T1027) was used to bypass antivirus detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
