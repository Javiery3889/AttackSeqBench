### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Compressing proprietary data using WinRAR.
     - Extracting data from Dropbox using cURL for Windows.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection**
   - **Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility**
     - This technique involves compressing data using utilities like WinRAR, which aligns with the first part of the sequence described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not directly related to the sequence of compressing data and extracting it from Dropbox.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to gain access to a system, which is not directly related to the sequence of compressing data and extracting it from Dropbox.
   - **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves collecting data from cloud storage services, which aligns with the second part of the sequence where data is extracted from Dropbox.
   - **D: T1614.001-System Language Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the system language, which is not directly related to the sequence of compressing data and extracting it from Dropbox.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves compressing data using WinRAR (T1560.001-Archive via Utility) and then extracting data from Dropbox.
   - The most logical next step after compressing the data would be to collect the data from the cloud storage service (Dropbox), which is described by T1530-Data from Cloud Storage.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage
