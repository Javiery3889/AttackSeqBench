### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlueDelta accessed credentials using vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - The initial access was gained by exploiting vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-35730.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
   - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves executing malicious code on a client system, typically through a vulnerability in a client application.
     - This is not the most likely next step after gaining initial access via a public-facing application.
   - **B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain access to credentials.
     - This aligns well with the scenario where BlueDelta accessed credentials using vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:**
     - This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malicious code.
     - This is not relevant to the scenario of accessing credentials after initial access.
   - **D: T1552.007-Container API:**
     - This technique involves exploiting container APIs to gain access to sensitive information.
     - This is not relevant to the scenario of accessing credentials after initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access by exploiting a public-facing application, the attackers would likely use T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access to access credentials.

**Final Answer: B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
