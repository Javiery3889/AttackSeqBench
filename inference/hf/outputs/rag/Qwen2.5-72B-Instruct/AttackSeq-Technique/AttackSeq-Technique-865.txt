### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by GreyEnergy operators:
     - They used spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers for initial access.
     - They then deployed modular malware functionalities dependent on specific combinations of modules uploaded to victim systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before deploying the modular malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious websites or files to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1087.001 - Local Account:** This technique involves enumerating local accounts on a system. While this could be useful for further reconnaissance, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately after gaining initial access and before deploying modular malware.
   - **B: T1587 - Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing or acquiring custom tools or capabilities. This is a preparatory step that occurs before the attack and is not a step that occurs immediately after gaining initial access.
   - **C: T1585.003 - Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves compromising cloud accounts. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately after gaining initial access and before deploying modular malware.
   - **D: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. This could be a plausible step after gaining initial access, as it allows the attackers to move laterally within the network and prepare for deploying modular malware.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is:
     1. Initial access via spearphishing and exploiting public-facing applications.
     2. Exploitation of remote services to gain deeper access and prepare for deploying modular malware.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique to occur before deploying modular malware is **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services
