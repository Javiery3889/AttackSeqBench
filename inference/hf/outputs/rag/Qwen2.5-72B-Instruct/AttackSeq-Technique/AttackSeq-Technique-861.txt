### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat group TG-3279:
     - They used Conpee or Etso tools on key hosts.
     - They added scheduled system tasks to key resources.
     - They used compromised credentials from pwdump6.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated C2 (Command and Control) communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Command and Control" and the Technique is "T1571-Non-Standard Port."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for C2 communication. However, the question specifically mentions port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS, not mail protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open ports. While it is a common initial step in many attacks, it does not directly facilitate C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. The question mentions using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure (e.g., servers, domains) to support the attack. While it is a preparatory step, it does not directly facilitate C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific mention of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, the most plausible answer is T1571-Non-Standard Port.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
