### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28:
     - Deployed additional modules (e.g., pr.dll) to collect and upload stolen data to the C&C server.
     - Exfiltrated specific information such as .pst and .dbx files to the central server.
   - We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. It is relevant to the C2 communication but not specifically to the data collection or exfiltration steps.
   - **B: T1218.011-Rundll32:**
     - This technique involves using the rundll32 utility to execute code. It is more relevant to the initial deployment of modules but not to the exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle:**
     - This technique involves intercepting and manipulating network traffic. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which aligns with the step of collecting and uploading stolen data to the C&C server before exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 collected data from information repositories (T1213) after deploying additional modules and before exfiltrating specific information.

**Final Answer: D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
