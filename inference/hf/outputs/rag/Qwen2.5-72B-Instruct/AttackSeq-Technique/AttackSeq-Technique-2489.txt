### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through spear-phishing with exploit-laden Word attachments or RAR archives delivering the PlugX RAT.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the PlugX RAT employed DLL side-loading techniques to execute its payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access tactic involves the technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This technique is used to deliver the initial payload (in this case, the PlugX RAT).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or document reader) to execute arbitrary code. This is a plausible technique that could be used to deliver the initial payload via the spear-phishing attachment.
   - **B: T1059.002-AppleScript:**
     - This technique involves using AppleScript to execute arbitrary code on macOS systems. It is not relevant to the context of a Windows-based attack using Word attachments or RAR archives.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While this could be used after initial access, it is not a technique that would be used to deliver the initial payload.
   - **D: T1535-Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions:**
     - This technique involves using cloud regions that are not typically used or supported by the target organization to avoid detection. This is not relevant to the initial access or payload delivery via spear-phishing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before the PlugX RAT employed DLL side-loading techniques to execute its payload is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

**Final Answer: A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
