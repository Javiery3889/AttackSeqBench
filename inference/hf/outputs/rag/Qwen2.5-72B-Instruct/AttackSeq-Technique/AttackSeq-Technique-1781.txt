### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a specific technique used by the malware "Sayad" to capture data from removable media as part of its collection activities.
   - The sequence of events is: gathering information (system data and running processes) → capturing data from removable media → communicating with C2 server to upload encrypted data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools or scripts to collect data from the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video from a device's camera. It does not align with the context of capturing data from removable media.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique directly aligns with the context of capturing data from removable media, which is explicitly mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance:** This technique involves running a virtual instance to hide the presence of the malware. It does not align with the context of capturing data from removable media.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not align with the context of capturing data from removable media.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is the technique that directly involves capturing data from removable media.

**Final Answer: B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
