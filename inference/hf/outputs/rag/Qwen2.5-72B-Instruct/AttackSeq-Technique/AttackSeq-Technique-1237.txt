### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an embedded DLL file is decoded using a 10-byte XOR key. This is an initial execution step.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to maintain the malware's presence for configuration updates.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Persistence):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to achieve persistence.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files to execute malicious code.
   - **T1027.009-Embedded Payloads (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves embedding malicious code within a file to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. While it can be used for persistence, it is not specifically related to maintaining the malware's presence for configuration updates.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence or configuration updates.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks, which is not related to maintaining persistence or configuration updates.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078.001-Default Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for initial access, it is not directly related to maintaining persistence or configuration updates.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible answer is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**. This technique is directly related to maintaining the malware's presence by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which can be used to facilitate configuration updates.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

However, based on the related TTPs and the context of maintaining the malware's presence for configuration updates, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading

But since T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is not one of the provided answer choices, the closest and most relevant answer is:

Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
