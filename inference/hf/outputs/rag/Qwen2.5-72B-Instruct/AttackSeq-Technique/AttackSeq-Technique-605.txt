### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where:
     - Adversaries deployed public domains like teamtnt[.]red for resource development.
     - Misconfigured Docker API ports were exploited for initial access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which aligns with the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container:**
     - This technique involves deploying containers, which could be part of the resource development phase.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.005-Scan Databases:**
     - This technique involves scanning databases to gather information, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase before exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1565-Data Manipulation:**
     - This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, which does not fit well between resource development and initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595-Active Scanning:**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which fits well between resource development and initial access. It is a logical step for adversaries to scan for misconfigured Docker API ports before exploiting them.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1590.002-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS for various purposes, which does not fit well between resource development and initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching:**
     - This technique involves using sudo and sudo caching for privilege escalation, which is more relevant to post-exploitation activities rather than the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversaries performed active scanning (T1595) to identify misconfigured Docker API ports before exploiting them for initial access.

**Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning**
