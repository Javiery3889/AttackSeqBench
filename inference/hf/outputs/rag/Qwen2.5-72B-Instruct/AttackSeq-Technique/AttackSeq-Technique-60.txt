### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by ScarCruft, starting with phishing emails containing malicious Office documents, leading to the execution of Office Macro Scripts.
   - The question asks which MITRE ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the use of DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves an adversary tricking users into opening a malicious file, such as a document, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1584.005-Botnet**: This technique involves the use of a botnet, which is a network of compromised devices. This does not fit the context of the sequence described, which starts with phishing and macro execution.
   - **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate programs to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible step before DLL Side-Loading, as it involves manipulating the execution flow.
   - **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This technique involves using scripting languages to execute commands. While it could be used in the context of macro execution, it is not as directly related to the sequence leading to DLL Side-Loading.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. This is closely related to DLL Side-Loading, but it is not a step that typically occurs before it.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. Phishing emails with malicious Office documents (T1204.002-Malicious File).
     2. Execution of Office Macro Scripts.
     3. Hijack Execution Flow (T1574) to manipulate the execution flow.
     4. DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow
