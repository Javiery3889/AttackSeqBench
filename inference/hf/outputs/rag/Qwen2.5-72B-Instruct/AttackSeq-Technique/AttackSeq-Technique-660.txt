### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office documents that use the DDE protocol for initial access.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the attacker used living off the land (LotL) tactics and removed tools from victim machines to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):** This technique involves using the DDE protocol to execute commands or download and execute malicious payloads.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil:** This technique involves using the InstallUtil utility to execute arbitrary code. While it is a method for execution, it is not typically used immediately after initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **B: T1606-Forge Web Credentials:** This technique involves creating fake web credentials to gain access to systems or accounts. This is not directly related to the initial access or the subsequent steps described in the question.
   - **C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical media. This is not relevant to the initial access or the steps described in the question.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This aligns well with the described sequence, as the attacker would likely remove tools and traces after using LotL tactics to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used T1070-Indicator Removal to remove tools and traces from the victim machines after using LotL tactics.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
