### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access scenario where a threat actor (FamousSparrow) gains access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint.
   - After gaining access, the actor executes SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain. While this is a common next step after gaining access, it does not directly relate to the execution of SparrowDoor.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**
     - This technique involves changing domain or tenant policies, which is typically used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. It does not directly relate to the execution of SparrowDoor.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code. While this is a method of gaining initial access, it does not fit the context of executing SparrowDoor on an already compromised system.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks. This is a plausible next step after gaining access, as it can be used to maintain persistence or execute additional payloads, such as SparrowDoor.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, FamousSparrow used the `at` command to schedule the execution of SparrowDoor.

**Final Answer: D: T1053.002-At**
