### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Darkhotel APT group.
   - They used digital certificates to sign their backdoors to bypass defenses.
   - They also involved encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
   - **Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malicious code to make it appear legitimate and bypass security defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is more about initial access or persistence rather than post-exploitation activities.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is more about credential access rather than defense evasion or data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to distribute malicious code. This is more about initial access and not post-exploitation activities.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This aligns well with the context of encrypting and storing gathered data in log files to evade detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT group used digital certificates to sign their backdoors (T1553.002-Code Signing) to bypass defenses.
   - After gaining access and establishing a foothold, they would likely want to hide their activities to avoid detection.
   - Encrypting and storing gathered data in log files is a common method to hide artifacts (T1564-Hide Artifacts).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
