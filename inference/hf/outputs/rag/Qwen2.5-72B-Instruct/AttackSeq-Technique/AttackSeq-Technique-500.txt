### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the SombRAT backdoor collected system information as part of the Discovery phase.
   - The context is that the CostaRicto Campaign used defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering running processes on a system to gather information about the system's state and to identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves adversaries deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection and analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack:** This technique involves downgrading security protocols to a less secure version to exploit vulnerabilities. This is not directly related to the Discovery phase or the collection of system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique is directly related to the Discovery phase and involves discovering running processes on a system, which is a common step before collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves tunneling protocols to evade detection, which is more related to network communication and not directly to the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1087.002-Domain Account:** This technique involves discovering domain accounts, which is also part of the Discovery phase but is more specific to identifying user accounts rather than system processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the SombRAT backdoor would first discover running processes (T1057-Process Discovery) before collecting system information.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
