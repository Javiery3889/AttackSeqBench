### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Tortoiseshell group:
     - They used malware to confirm Google was reachable.
     - They ensured they could bypass network-based defenses.
     - They then used the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' to collect detailed system information for further attacks.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between confirming Google was reachable and collecting detailed system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a form of data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks and their configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing messages to internal users to gain access or spread malware. It does not fit the context of confirming network reachability or collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves sending phishing messages to gain access or spread malware. It is typically used in the initial access phase and does not fit the context of confirming network reachability or collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain higher privileges or access to other accounts. It is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase and does not fit the context of confirming network reachability or collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade virtualized environments and sandboxes. It is relevant to ensuring that the malware can bypass network-based defenses, which fits the context of confirming Google was reachable and ensuring network defenses are bypassed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of confirming network reachability and ensuring network defenses are bypassed, the most plausible technique that occurred between these actions and the collection of detailed system information is **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**.

**Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
