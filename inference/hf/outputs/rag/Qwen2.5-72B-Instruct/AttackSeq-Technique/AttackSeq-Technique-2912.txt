### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after APT15 used tools like CSVDE and BCP to export data and bespoke tools to extract information from Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange.
   - The focus is on the sequence of actions after the data extraction.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails from a remote email server, which aligns with the extraction of information from Microsoft Exchange.
   - **T1213.002-Sharepoint:** This technique involves collecting data from SharePoint, which aligns with the extraction of information from Microsoft SharePoint.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves initial access through spearphishing with an attachment, which is not directly relevant to the data extraction and post-extraction activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves collecting data from various information repositories, which is a broader category that includes both SharePoint and Exchange. However, the question is asking about what happens after the data is extracted.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access or exfiltrate data, which is not directly related to the post-extraction activities described.
   - **C: T1074-Data Staged:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration by staging it in a specific location. This is a logical next step after data has been extracted from SharePoint and Exchange.
   - **D: T1558.005-Ccache Files:** This technique involves using Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) files, which is not directly related to the data extraction or post-extraction activities described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible next step after extracting data from SharePoint and Exchange would be to stage the data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1074-Data Staged**
