### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker reuses command and control (C2) infrastructure from other groups and separates spear-phishing infrastructure from malware C2 infrastructure.
   - The goal is to establish communication channels to maintain control over the victim environment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and resilience.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication methods if the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate network traffic to mask malicious activity. While it can be used to maintain communication, it is not specifically about establishing new communication channels.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate web pages. It is not directly related to establishing communication channels.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves tricking victims into providing sensitive information. It is more about gathering information rather than establishing communication channels.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server. This can be used to establish and maintain communication channels, especially when the attacker needs to bypass network security controls.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant techniques from the related TTPs are T1572, T1104, and T1008, all of which are about maintaining and establishing communication channels.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1090-Proxy** aligns best with the goal of establishing communication channels to maintain control over the victim environment. It is a common technique used to route traffic through an intermediary server, which can help in bypassing network security controls and maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy
