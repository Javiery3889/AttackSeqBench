### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs before executing PowerShell scripts to drop additional files.
   - The context is a Bandook campaign that uses URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.005-Link Target:** This technique involves creating or using links to target specific resources, which aligns with the use of URL shortening services.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into a web page or application. It does not align well with the sequence described, which involves URL shortening and PowerShell execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate. While it could be used after gaining access, it is not a likely precursor to executing PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to gain access. It is not directly related to the use of URL shortening or PowerShell execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584.005-Botnet:** This technique involves using a botnet to conduct attacks. It is not a likely precursor to the specific sequence described.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker uses a spearphishing link (T1566.002) to gain initial access, which then leads to the use of URL shortening services (T1608.005) to redirect to a controlled domain, and finally, the execution of PowerShell scripts (T1059.001) to drop additional files.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
