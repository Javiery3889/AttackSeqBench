### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors have successfully evaded defenses using techniques like Masquerading (T1036) and Subvert Trust Controls (T1484.002).
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to gather internal system information to further their objectives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1484.002-Trust Modification:** This technique involves modifying trust relationships to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear benign to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a remote service session to gain control. While this could be used to gather information, it is more focused on hijacking sessions rather than discovering internal system information.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. This is a common step in gathering internal system information to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **C: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves stealing the NTDS.dit file, which contains user account information. This is more specific to credential access and not general system information gathering.
   - **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network. While this is useful for gathering information, it is more focused on network discovery rather than internal system information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of gathering internal system information to further their objectives, the most plausible technique is **T1057-Process Discovery**. This technique allows threat actors to understand what processes are running on the system, which can provide valuable insights into the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
