### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Shuckworm:
     - Executes malicious VBS scripts.
     - Maintains persistence through scheduled tasks.
     - Downloads additional payloads from C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
   - These TTPs confirm that the malware uses scheduled tasks for persistence and execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves the adversary transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.
     - This aligns with the scenario where Shuckworm downloads additional payloads from C&C servers.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs and is used for persistence and execution, not for downloading additional payloads.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of network traffic.
     - It does not fit the scenario of downloading additional payloads.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from keychain storage.
     - It does not fit the scenario of downloading additional payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is that Shuckworm used **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** to download additional payloads from their C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
