### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the SLUB backdoor performs a discovery process by retrieving commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet and obtaining the username and computer name.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this discovery process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Discovery" and the technique is "T1033-System Owner/User Discovery."
   - This suggests that the backdoor is gathering information about the system owner or user.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1485-Data Destruction**
     - This technique involves destroying data on a system, which is not typically a discovery action. It is more likely to occur after the attacker has already gathered the necessary information and decided to cause damage.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While this could be part of the backdoor's operations, it is not directly related to the discovery process described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which aligns perfectly with the described action of obtaining the username and computer name.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This is a duplicate of Answer Choice B and has the same evaluation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description of the discovery process, the most plausible sequence is that the backdoor performed T1033-System Owner/User Discovery after retrieving commands and obtaining the username and computer name.

**Final Answer: C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
