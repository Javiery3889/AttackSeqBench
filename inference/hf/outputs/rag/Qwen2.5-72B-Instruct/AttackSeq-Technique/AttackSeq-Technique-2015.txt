### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where adversaries used BlackEnergy 3 plugins to conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions. They then enumerated all networked devices on the ICS network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique is used to capture network traffic to obtain credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and devices to understand the network topology.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves probing a network to identify active hosts, open ports, and services. While it is a discovery technique, it is more about initial reconnaissance rather than detailed enumeration of networked devices.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network. It is a broader discovery technique but does not specifically focus on detailed enumeration of networked devices.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance:** This technique involves running a virtual instance to hide activities or to create a new environment. It is not related to network discovery or enumeration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This technique involves identifying and accessing cloud accounts. It is not related to network discovery or enumeration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for the detailed enumeration of networked devices on the ICS network is **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. This technique aligns with the described action of identifying and enumerating all networked devices.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery

However, based on the detailed analysis, the most precise answer should be **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. Since this is not one of the provided choices, the closest match is **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**.
