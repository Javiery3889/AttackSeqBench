### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker has already established command and control (C2) through HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites.
   - The next step involves the attacker attempting to move between systems using a `net use` command after positive ping responses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves the attacker discovering remote systems on the network, which aligns with the positive ping responses.
   - **T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle:** This technique involves intercepting and manipulating network traffic, which is not directly relevant to the `net use` command.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement, which is relevant to the `net use` command.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions, which is not relevant to the `net use` command or the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to move laterally, which is relevant to the `net use` command. The `net use` command is often used to map network drives or establish connections to remote systems, which is a form of remote service.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which is not directly relevant to the `net use` command.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves hiding files or directories, which is not relevant to the `net use` command or the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1021-Remote Services**. The `net use` command is a common method for establishing remote connections and facilitating lateral movement, which aligns with the T1021 technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services**
