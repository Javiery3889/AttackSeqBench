### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary copied results from the discovery phase, which included file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes.
   - The final step in the sequence is exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from various sources.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114-Email Collection:**
     - This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's email client or server.
     - While this could be part of the collection phase, it is not directly related to the discovery of file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1080-Taint Shared Content:**
     - This technique involves modifying or tainting shared content to manipulate or influence the victim.
     - This does not align with the collection of data from the discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which aligns well with the discovery of remote system shares.
     - After discovering file and directory lists and remote system shares, the adversary would likely collect data from these shared drives.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system.
     - This is more related to the initial access or lateral movement phase, not the collection phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the adversary discovered file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes, they would collect data from network shared drives.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**.

Final Answer: C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive
