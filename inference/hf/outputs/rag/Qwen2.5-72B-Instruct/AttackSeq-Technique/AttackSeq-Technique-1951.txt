### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to maintain the malware's presence on the system after leveraging DLL side-loading for the execution of the PlugX RAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
   - These TTPs indicate that DLL side-loading is being used for both persistence and defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**
     - This technique involves modifying the Outlook Home Page to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the context of DLL side-loading.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
     - This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to capture credentials. It is more related to credential theft and not persistence.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. This is a common method for maintaining persistence on a system.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. It is not related to maintaining persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the question is about maintaining the malware's presence on the system after using DLL side-loading, the most plausible answer is the one that directly relates to persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most relevant technique for maintaining persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
