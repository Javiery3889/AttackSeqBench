### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by the Lazarus group to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
   - These TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing, specifically spear-phishing with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from files on a system. It is not typically used for preparing and targeting individuals before an attack.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, such as names, job titles, and contact information. This is crucial for preparing a targeted spear-phishing attack.
   - **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
     - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While it can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not as specific to targeting individuals as gathering identity information.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools to distribute malware. It is not relevant to the preparation phase of targeting specific individuals.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the need to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry, the most plausible technique is **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**.

**Final Answer: B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
