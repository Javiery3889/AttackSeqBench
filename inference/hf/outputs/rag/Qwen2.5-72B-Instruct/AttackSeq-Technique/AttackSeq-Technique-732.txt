### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to hide the location of the control server and secure communications after the main component has been executed and additional spy modules have been received.
   - The context is the 'Red October' campaign, which is known for its sophisticated and stealthy methods.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server to hide the true destination or to bypass security controls.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server, which can be used to hide the true destination.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication methods if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets:** This technique is related to credential access and does not directly address hiding the location of the control server or securing communications.
   - **B: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs):** This technique involves generating a large number of domain names to use as potential C&C servers, which can help in evading detection and hiding the true server location. However, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to secure communications, which is relevant to securing the communication channel but not specifically to hiding the location of the control server.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands, which is not directly related to hiding the location of the control server or securing communications.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant techniques from the related TTPs are T1090-Proxy and T1071.004-DNS, both of which are used to hide the location of the control server and secure communications.
   - T1090-Proxy is particularly relevant because it directly involves routing traffic through an intermediary server to hide the true destination.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1090-Proxy**
