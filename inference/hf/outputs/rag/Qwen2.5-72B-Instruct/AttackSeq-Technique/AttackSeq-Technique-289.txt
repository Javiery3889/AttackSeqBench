### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by the threat actor "Before Dropping Elephant" to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before gaining Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary ones are detected or fail. This is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While this could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not specifically focused on gathering information about high-profile entities.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim, such as names, titles, and roles, which is highly relevant to targeting high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
   - **D: T1074-Data Staged:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration, which is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique used to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before the spear-phishing attack is **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**.

**Final Answer: C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
