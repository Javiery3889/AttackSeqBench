### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by BRONZE PRESIDENT, specifically what technique likely occurred before they employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.
   - The focus is on the initial steps that would lead to the use of these tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves obtaining or developing tools to support operations. This is a crucial step before using tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to execute malicious code. This is a step that would occur after obtaining the tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a common initial access technique used to gain entry into a target network. While it is a plausible technique, it is not directly related to the development or obtaining of tools.
   - **B: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves stealing web cookies, which is more related to credential access and persistence rather than the initial development or obtaining of tools.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain access to a target. While it is a sophisticated method, it is not directly related to the development or obtaining of tools.
   - **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining or developing tools, which aligns directly with the related TTP T1588.002-Tool. It is a logical step before using tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of events, the most plausible answer is the one that involves obtaining or developing the tools before using them for execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
