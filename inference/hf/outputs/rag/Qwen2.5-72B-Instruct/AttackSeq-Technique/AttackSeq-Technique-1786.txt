### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already performed privilege escalation using Mimikatz for credential dumping.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to bypass application whitelisting and security software to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to evade defenses.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This is a repeat of the first TTP, emphasizing the importance of bypassing UAC.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**: This technique is related to bypassing UAC on Unix-like systems, which is not directly relevant to the Windows environment where Mimikatz is typically used.
   - **B: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves discovering system and application accounts, which is not directly related to bypassing application whitelisting or security software.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate processes to execute malicious code, which can be used to bypass application whitelisting and security software.
   - **D: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware, which is not directly related to bypassing application whitelisting or security software.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique to follow after privilege escalation and credential dumping, to bypass application whitelisting and security software, is **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**. This technique allows attackers to execute their malicious code by hijacking the execution flow of legitimate processes, which is a common method to evade detection and maintain stealth.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow
