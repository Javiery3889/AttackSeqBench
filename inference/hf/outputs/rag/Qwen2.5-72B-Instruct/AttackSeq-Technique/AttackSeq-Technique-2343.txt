### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a VBA macro is executed using `mshta.exe` to download a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure continuous execution of the malicious code every two hours.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VB) for execution, which aligns with the use of a VBA macro and VBScript in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
     - This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, such as making the data less useful or changing its meaning. It does not fit the context of ensuring continuous execution of malicious code.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While phishing might be used to initially deliver the VBA macro, it does not fit the context of ensuring continuous execution.
   - **C: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a Terminal Services process. It is not relevant to ensuring continuous execution of a script.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to execute a command or script at a specific time or interval. This fits the context of ensuring continuous execution of the malicious code every two hours.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the creation of a scheduled task to ensure continuous execution of the malicious code every two hours.

**Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
