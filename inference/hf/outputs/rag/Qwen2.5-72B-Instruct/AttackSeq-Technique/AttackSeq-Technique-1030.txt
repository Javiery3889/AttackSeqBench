### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server after using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automatic transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection. While this could be relevant in some exfiltration scenarios, it does not specifically describe the automatic uploading of documents to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using add-ins to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique directly aligns with the scenario described in the question. It involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control, which fits the context of using HTTP and HTTPS for both C2 and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to execute commands. It is not directly related to exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
