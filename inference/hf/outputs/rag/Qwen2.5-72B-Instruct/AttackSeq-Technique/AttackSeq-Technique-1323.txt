### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and a Windows service.
   - After achieving persistence, the malware searches hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns, including non-English filenames.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs focus on the **Persistence** tactic and the **T1053.005-Scheduled Task** technique.
   - This indicates that the initial steps of the attack involve setting up persistence mechanisms using scheduled tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard**
     - This technique involves using cloud service dashboards to manage and control infrastructure. It does not align with the described behavior of searching for files on hard drives and network drives.
   - **B: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
     - This technique involves listing processes to identify targets for process injection. It does not align with the described behavior of searching for files.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries searching for specific files and directories on the system. This aligns perfectly with the described behavior of searching hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to achieve persistence. While it is relevant to the initial steps of the attack, it does not align with the subsequent behavior of searching for files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the described behavior, is **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
