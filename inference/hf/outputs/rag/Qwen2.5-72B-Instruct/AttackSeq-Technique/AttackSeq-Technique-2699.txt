### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging (defense evasion) and then extracted credentials from the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell for execution, which can be used to run scripts and commands.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, such as from memory, credential stores, or other sources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using protocols other than the standard ones. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly follow the described sequence of bypassing logging and extracting credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:** This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate to services. While it is related to credential access, it is more specific to Kerberos and does not directly follow the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting:** This technique involves attacking the Kerberos Authentication Service (AS) to obtain user credentials. It is more specific to Kerberos and does not directly follow the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which aligns perfectly with the described sequence of extracting credentials after bypassing logging.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**.

**Final Answer: D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
