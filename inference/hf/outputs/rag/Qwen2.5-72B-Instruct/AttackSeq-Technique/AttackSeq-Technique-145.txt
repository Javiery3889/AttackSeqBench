### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the Phosphorus group exploited Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, they used scheduled tasks and Registry RunKeys for persistence.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was used to execute commands and download additional payloads via the PowerLess Backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain access to a compromised system. While it could be relevant in a broader context, it does not specifically address the execution of commands and downloading payloads.
   - **B: T1053.002-At:** This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks. While it is related to persistence, it does not directly address the execution of commands and downloading payloads.
   - **C: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves discovering system and domain accounts. It is not directly related to executing commands or downloading payloads.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts. This is the most relevant technique for executing commands and downloading additional payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter to execute commands and download additional payloads via the PowerLess Backdoor.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
