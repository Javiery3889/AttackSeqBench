### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the defense evasion technique used by Charming Kitten before they used hidden tracking images to monitor when targets opened phishing emails.
   - The focus is on the defense evasion strategy, which is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to gather information about the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing emails with links to gain initial access to the target's system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves making malicious files or processes appear benign to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique aligns with the defense evasion tactic. It involves making malicious files or processes appear benign, which is a common strategy to avoid detection by security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:**
     - This technique is more related to reconnaissance and gathering information about the target, not specifically to defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1003.006-DCSync:**
     - This technique is related to credential access and involves synchronizing with the Domain Controller to obtain credentials. It is not a defense evasion technique.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:**
     - This technique is also a defense evasion technique, but it involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute malicious activities. While it is a valid defense evasion technique, it is not as directly related to the context of making phishing emails appear benign.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible defense evasion technique used by Charming Kitten before using hidden tracking images is **T1036-Masquerading**.

**Final Answer: A: T1036-Masquerading**
