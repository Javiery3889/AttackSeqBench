### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a keylogger component is used to collect keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - The data is then stored in a specific directory in an encrypted format.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from various sources and staging it in a local directory before exfiltration.
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes and clipboard data to gather sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying active user accounts, which is not directly related to the collection and storage of keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate. However, the question specifies that the data is stored in an encrypted format, not necessarily archived.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to coincide with specific events. This is not directly related to the collection and storage of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This is the same as Answer Choice B and has the same evaluation.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the scenario described is **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**. This technique involves collecting data from various sources and staging it in a local directory, which aligns with the described action of storing the collected keystrokes and clipboard data in a specific directory.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**
