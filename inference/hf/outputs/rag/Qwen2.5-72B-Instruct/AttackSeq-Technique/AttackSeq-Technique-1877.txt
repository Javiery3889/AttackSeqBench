### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before FIN13 used external servers to deploy web shells for initial access.
   - The focus is on the reconnaissance phase, specifically understanding the victim's organizational structure and planning for infiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves using web shells to maintain persistence on a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's organization, such as network structure, employee details, and organizational hierarchy.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1006-Direct Volume Access:** This technique involves accessing and manipulating file systems directly. It is more relevant to post-compromise activities and does not fit the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique involves searching for publicly available information on the internet. While it is a form of reconnaissance, it is more specific to finding open websites and domains rather than understanding the organizational structure.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique directly aligns with the question's requirement to understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration. It is a broad and comprehensive reconnaissance technique.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. It is more relevant to post-compromise activities and does not fit the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN13 first gathered victim organization information (T1591) to understand the victim's structure and plan for infiltration, followed by using external servers to deploy web shells for initial access.

**Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
