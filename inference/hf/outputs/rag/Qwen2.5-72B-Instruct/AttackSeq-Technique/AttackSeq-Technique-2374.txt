### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware employed features to delete itself past a hardcoded date to evade detection.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware deletes itself.
     - This deletion is time-based (past a hardcoded date).
     - The purpose is to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the malware, which aligns with the malware deleting itself.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading detection by performing actions at specific times, which aligns with the malware deleting itself past a hardcoded date.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556-Modify Authentication Process:**
     - This technique involves changing the authentication process, which is not directly related to time-based evasion or file deletion.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which could be a precursor to time-based evasion but is not directly related to file deletion.
   - **C: T1480-Execution Guardrails:**
     - This technique involves setting conditions to ensure the malware only runs in a specific environment, which is not directly related to time-based evasion or file deletion.
   - **D: T1590.002-DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS for various purposes, which is not directly related to time-based evasion or file deletion.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware first discovers system information (T1082) to determine the current date and time. This information is then used to decide whether to delete itself (T1070.004) past a hardcoded date to evade detection (T1497.003).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
