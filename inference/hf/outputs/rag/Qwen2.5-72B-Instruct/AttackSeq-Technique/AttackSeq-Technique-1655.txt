### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability is exploited for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers customized Android backdoors to collect SMS messages and call information for command and control purposes.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the customization of the Android backdoors.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves tricking users into visiting a malicious website that exploits a vulnerability in their browser.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to prepare it for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1552.007-Container API:** This technique involves accessing sensitive information from container APIs. It is not directly related to the initial access or the collection of SMS messages and call information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting identity information from the victim. While this could be useful for further attacks, it is not directly related to the collection of SMS messages and call information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.012-Print Processors:** This technique involves modifying print processors to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to the initial access or the collection of SMS messages and call information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which can be used to collect sensitive information like SMS messages and call information. This is the most relevant technique to the collection of SMS messages and call information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used T1056-Input Capture to collect SMS messages and call information before customizing the Android backdoors for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
