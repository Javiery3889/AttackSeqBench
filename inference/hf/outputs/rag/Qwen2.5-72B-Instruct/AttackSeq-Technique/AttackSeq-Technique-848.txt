### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where adversaries have already discovered critical systems and gained valid credentials to enable legitimate access within the target network.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to move across the network to further their objectives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to evade detection and maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and command and control. While this could be relevant, it is not the most immediate next step after gaining valid credentials and discovering critical systems.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification:** This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies to maintain access or evade detection. This is a more advanced step and not typically the immediate next step after gaining valid credentials.
   - **C: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within the network. While this could be relevant, it is more specific to cloud environments and not a general next step.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within the network. This is a common and logical next step after gaining valid credentials and discovering critical systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of an attack, the most plausible next step after gaining valid credentials and discovering critical systems is to exploit remote services to move laterally within the network.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
