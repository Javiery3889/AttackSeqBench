### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated the OceanLotus Group's ability to maintain Command and Control (C2) communication after lateral movement with stolen credentials.
   - The context involves exfiltrating data via a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a communication channel used to control the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves tunneling one protocol inside another to bypass network security. While it can be used for C2, it is not specifically about maintaining access with stolen credentials.
   - **B: T1650-Acquire Access:** This technique involves gaining initial access to a system, which is not the focus of the question. The question is about maintaining access after lateral movement.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is a step that would be taken before lateral movement. It is not about maintaining C2 communication.
   - **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication. While it is related to C2, it does not specifically address maintaining access with stolen credentials.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining C2 communication after lateral movement with stolen credentials is **T1078-Valid Accounts**. This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a network, which aligns with the context of the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**

However, based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using **T1078-Valid Accounts** to maintain C2 communication after lateral movement with stolen credentials. Therefore, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1078-Valid Accounts** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant technique based on the context.)
