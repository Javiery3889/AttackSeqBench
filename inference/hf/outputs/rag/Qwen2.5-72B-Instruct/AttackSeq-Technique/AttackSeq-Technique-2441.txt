### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Mustang Panda fetched additional shellcode from a C2 IP address to execute on infected endpoints, specifically in the context of deploying the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from the C2 server to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to avoid detection. While this could be used for C2, it is not specifically about transferring tools or files.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute commands or scripts at specific times. This is more about persistence and execution rather than transferring tools.
   - **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves moving tools or files between systems within a network. This is more about lateral movement rather than initial tool transfer from a C2 server.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from the C2 server to the victim's system. This aligns well with the context of fetching additional shellcode and deploying the PlugX implant.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PlugX implant was deployed using T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer before fetching additional shellcode from the C2 IP address.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
