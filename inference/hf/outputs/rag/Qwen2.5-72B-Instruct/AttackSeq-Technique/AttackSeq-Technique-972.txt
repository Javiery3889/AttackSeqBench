### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by Naikon APT to enumerate network connections of the victim’s machine.
   - The sequence of actions includes:
     - Conducting reconnaissance to gather information about user accounts, software, and active processes.
     - Using fileless techniques to avoid detection.
     - Enumerating network connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Discovery
     - Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique is directly related to the discovery of network connections, which aligns with the question's requirement to enumerate network connections.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**
     - This technique involves impersonating protocols or services to avoid detection, which is not directly related to enumerating network connections.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**
     - This technique is about discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not relevant to enumerating network connections on a victim’s machine.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is not directly related to enumerating network connections.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Naikon APT used T1049-System Network Connections Discovery to enumerate network connections of the victim’s machine.

**Final Answer: A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
