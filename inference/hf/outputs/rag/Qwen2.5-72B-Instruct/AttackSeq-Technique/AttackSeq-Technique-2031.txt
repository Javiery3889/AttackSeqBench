### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Duke group securely communicates with a C&C server over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels.
   - After this communication, the group archives and transmits sensitive information using legitimate cloud services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different protocol than the one used for command and control. This does not fit the scenario where the data is transmitted using legitimate cloud services.
   - **B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of sensitive information using cloud services.
   - **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using web services, which aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services for data transmission.
   - **D: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using cloud accounts for various purposes, but it does not specifically mention exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS, the Duke group used legitimate cloud services to exfiltrate sensitive information. This aligns with the technique **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
