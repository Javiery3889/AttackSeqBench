### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where stolen data is processed, staged, and encrypted in the %TEMP% directory.
   - The next step is to initiate communications with a C2 server using specific UDP or TCP ports.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data in a local directory (e.g., %TEMP%) before exfiltration.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for standard network communications, which can include non-standard ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which aligns with the use of UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:**
     - This technique involves communication that is one-way, which is not specifically mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1037.005-Startup Items:**
     - This technique involves setting up persistence through startup items, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1518-Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering software on the system, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of non-standard ports for communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
