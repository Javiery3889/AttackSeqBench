### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through spear phishing emails containing malicious documents with scripts.
   - These scripts fetched additional payloads, which were then executed by batch files decoded from base64 text.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique specifically involves using spear phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication:** This technique involves using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to communicate between processes. It is not directly related to the execution of batch files or the decoding of base64 text.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms designed to control elevation of privileges. It is not directly related to the execution of batch files or the decoding of base64 text.
   - **C: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation:** This technique involves generating requests for multi-factor authentication. It is not relevant to the execution of batch files or the decoding of base64 text.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. This is directly relevant to the execution of batch files and the decoding of base64 text.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question, is that the batch files were executed using a command and scripting interpreter. This aligns with the technique T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
