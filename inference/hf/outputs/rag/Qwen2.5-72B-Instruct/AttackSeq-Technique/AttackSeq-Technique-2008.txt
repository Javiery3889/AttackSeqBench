### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the KopiLuwak backdoor has already established communication with compromised websites via HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2).
   - We need to determine the most likely next step in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication, which aligns with the initial step described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1537-Transfer Data to Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves transferring data to a cloud account, which is a form of exfiltration. However, it is not typically the immediate next step after establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the network configuration of the compromised system. While this can be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel. This is a logical next step after the C2 communication is established, as the attacker may want to exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **D: T1542.002-Component Firmware**
     - This technique involves modifying component firmware, which is not typically a next step in the immediate sequence after establishing C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence after establishing C2 communication via HTTP POST requests is exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
