### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the APT-TOCS evaded detection by executing malicious code in memory without any hard disk activity and running multi-beacon communication.
   - The key points are:
     - Evading detection
     - Executing malicious code in memory
     - Running multi-beacon communication

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by timing the execution of malicious activities to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into a running process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This is a broader category that includes various methods of injecting code into processes to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically related to evading detection or executing code in memory.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059.009-Cloud API:** This technique involves using cloud-based APIs to execute commands. It is not directly related to evading detection or executing code in memory.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. While it is a common initial attack vector, it does not directly relate to evading detection or executing code in memory.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes:** This technique involves manipulating file attributes to hide files. While it can be used for evasion, it is not specifically related to executing code in memory.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant techniques from the related TTPs are T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection and T1055-Process Injection. These techniques are directly related to evading detection by injecting code into memory.
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence would involve a technique that allows the attacker to inject code into memory before evading detection and running multi-beacon communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
