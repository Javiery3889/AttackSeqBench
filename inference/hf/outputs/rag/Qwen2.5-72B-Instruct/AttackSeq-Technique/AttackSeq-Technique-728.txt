### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the 'Red October' campaign established a foothold through executing exploits in malicious documents delivered via email.
   - The focus is on the technique used to achieve initial access before deploying the main malware component.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - This suggests that the initial access was achieved through a spearphishing attack that involved sending malicious attachments via email.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses, which is not directly related to initial access through email.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a broader category of phishing techniques, which includes spearphishing.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is the same as option B.
   - **D: T1087.002-Domain Account**
     - This technique involves gathering information about domain accounts, which is more related to the discovery phase rather than initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique for achieving initial access through a spearphishing attack with a malicious attachment is "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - Both options B and C are listed as "T1566-Phishing," which is the broader category that includes "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
