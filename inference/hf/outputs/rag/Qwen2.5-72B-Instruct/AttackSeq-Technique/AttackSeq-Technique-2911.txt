### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT15 evaded policy settings that disabled the command prompt by copying and patching `cmd.exe`.
   - This action was followed by the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562.002-Disable Windows Event Logging:** This technique involves impairing defenses by disabling event logging, which can help the attacker avoid detection.
   - **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using the command shell for execution, which is relevant to the use of `cmd.exe`.
   - **T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the registry to achieve persistence or other malicious goals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable:** This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table, which is not directly related to the described sequence of evading command prompt policies and installing a backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This is a broader category that includes T1562.002-Disable Windows Event Logging. While it is relevant, it is not the most specific technique that would follow the described actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:** This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not directly related to the described sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves the attacker using the modified `cmd.exe` to execute commands and then modifying the registry to achieve persistence for the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - **T1112-Modify Registry** is the most specific and relevant technique that would follow the described actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1112-Modify Registry**
