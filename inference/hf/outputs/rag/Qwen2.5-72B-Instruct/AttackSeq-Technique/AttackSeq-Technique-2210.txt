### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to gather email data from the victim's systems after leveraging credential access tools like Mimikatz and procdump.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data from the victim's systems.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs to transfer files. It is not related to email collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1606.001-Web Cookies:** This technique involves collecting web cookies, which is not related to email collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1114-Email Collection:** This technique directly involves collecting email data from the victim's systems, which aligns with the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the screen, which is not related to email collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves collecting email data after gaining credential access.

**Final Answer: C: T1114-Email Collection**
