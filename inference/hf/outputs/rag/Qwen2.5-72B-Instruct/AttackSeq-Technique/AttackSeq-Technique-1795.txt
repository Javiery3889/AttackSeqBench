### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group conducted lateral movement using harvested credentials and Windows built-in tools.
   - The key elements are "lateral movement," "harvested credentials," and "Windows built-in tools."

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a remote system to enable lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains. While this can be useful for planning lateral movement, it is not directly related to harvesting credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves identifying valid accounts on a system. This is a step that often precedes credential harvesting but is not as specific as the techniques listed in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about victim identities, which is useful for social engineering but not directly related to credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1110.001-Password Guessing:** This technique involves guessing passwords, which is a method of credential access but is not as reliable or common as credential dumping.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant techniques from the related TTPs are T1003.001-LSASS Memory and T1003-OS Credential Dumping. These techniques involve harvesting credentials, which is a crucial step before using those credentials for lateral movement.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1087-Account Discovery** (B) is the closest to the credential harvesting techniques mentioned in the related TTPs. It is a necessary step to identify which accounts to target for credential dumping.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1087-Account Discovery
