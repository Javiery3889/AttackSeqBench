### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the malware Gimmick evades detection and maintains a foothold by exploiting CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) restrictions.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during Gimmick's use of Google Drive for its operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.006-Web Services:** This technique involves using web services to support the adversary's operations, such as hosting malware, exfiltrating data, or communicating with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a victim's system by having them visit a malicious website or a website that has been compromised.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1491.001-Internal Defacement:** This technique involves altering or defacing the content of a website or application. This does not align with the use of Google Drive for operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques to obfuscate data. While this could be used in various stages of an attack, it does not specifically relate to the use of Google Drive.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1176-Browser Extensions:** This technique involves using browser extensions to gain persistence, privilege escalation, or to execute other malicious activities. This could be relevant if the malware is using a browser extension to interact with Google Drive, but it is not the most direct match.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. Given that Google Drive is a web service, this technique is the most relevant as it involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to interact with Google Drive.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of web protocols to communicate with Google Drive, which aligns with the technique T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
