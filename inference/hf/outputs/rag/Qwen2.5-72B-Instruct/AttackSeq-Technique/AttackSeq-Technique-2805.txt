### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Grandoreiro malware gains credential access by stealing credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur as it collects information such as usernames and other account-related details from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Credential Access" and the Technique is "T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers."
   - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the scenario of stealing credentials from Google Chrome.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and defenses. It does not align with the collection of account-related details.
   - **B: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery:** This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks and their configurations. It is not related to collecting account-related details.
   - **C: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves collecting account information, such as usernames and other account-related details, from the victim's system. This aligns well with the scenario described.
   - **D: T1070.010-Relocate Malware:** This technique involves moving malware to a different location on the system. It does not align with the collection of account-related details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining credential access by stealing credentials from web browsers, the next step is to collect account-related details from the victim's system.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **C: T1087-Account Discovery**.

Final Answer: **C: T1087-Account Discovery**
