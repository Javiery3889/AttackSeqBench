### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the Lazarus Group used malicious macros for initial access.
   - The goal is to gather information about the pharmaceutical company's network for further exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves executing a malicious file, which aligns with the use of malicious macros.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with an attachment, which is a common method for delivering malicious macros.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities:** This technique involves identifying and using vulnerabilities, which is a preparatory step but not directly related to the immediate next step after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. While it could be used for command and control (C2) communication, it is not specifically about gathering network information.
   - **B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the goal of equipping the attackers with knowledge about the network for further exploitation.
   - **C: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL:** This technique involves modifying the password filter DLL to capture credentials. While it is a useful technique for credential harvesting, it is not directly about gathering network information.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:** This technique involves searching open technical databases for information. While it can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not as directly relevant to gathering information about the victim's network after initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial access via malicious macros, the attackers would gather information about the victim's network to facilitate further exploitation.

**Final Answer: B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
