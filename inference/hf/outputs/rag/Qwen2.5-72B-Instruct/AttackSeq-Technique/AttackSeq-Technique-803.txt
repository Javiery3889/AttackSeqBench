### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a JavaScript file creates an executable (`d3reEW.exe`) to discover IP address information using the command `cmd /c ipconfig`.
   - The next step in the sequence involves enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Discovery** and the technique is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**.
   - This technique involves the adversary discovering the system's network configuration, which includes IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C&C server. This is a plausible next step after discovering network configuration.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. This is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. This is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering whether the system has an active internet connection. While this is part of the discovery process, it is not the next step in enabling HTTPS communication.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After discovering the system's network configuration (T1016), the next logical step to enable HTTPS communication with a C&C server would be to use an application layer protocol (T1071) to establish the connection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
