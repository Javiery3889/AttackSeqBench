### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious Flash file containing the 'show.swf' exploit is used to install a payload.
   - The payload is embedded in an animated GIF image to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the initial execution of the Flash file.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks:** This technique involves checking user activity to avoid detection, which is not directly relevant to the embedding of the payload.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding malicious code within other files to avoid detection, which directly aligns with the embedding of the payload in an animated GIF image.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a client application to execute code, which is relevant to the initial execution of the Flash file but not to the embedding of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1218.007-Msiexec:** This technique involves using the Windows Installer service to execute code, which is not relevant to the scenario described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552.006-Group Policy Preferences:** This technique involves using Group Policy Preferences to gather information, which is not relevant to the embedding of the payload.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection, which is a broader category that could include embedding payloads but is not as specific as T1027.009.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique to the scenario of embedding the payload in an animated GIF image to avoid detection is T1027.009-Embedded Payloads.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**

However, based on the specific context of embedding the payload in an animated GIF image, the most precise answer is:

**Final Answer: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most accurate based on the related TTPs and the question context.) 

Given the provided choices, the closest and most relevant answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
