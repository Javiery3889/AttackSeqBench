### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a file's time is modified to evade detection, followed by the installation of a secondary payload using a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves modifying file times to evade detection.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.
   - **T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which is not relevant to the described sequence of modifying file times and using a JavaScript-based exploit.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which aligns with the use of a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic, which is not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly relevant to the sequence of modifying file times and using a JavaScript-based exploit.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker exploited a vulnerability in a public-facing application (Internet Explorer 6) using a JavaScript-based exploit before installing the secondary payload. This aligns with the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
