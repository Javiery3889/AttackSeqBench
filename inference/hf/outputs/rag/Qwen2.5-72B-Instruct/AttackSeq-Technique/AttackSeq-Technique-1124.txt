### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware has been concealed using defense evasion techniques such as hiding files with attributes and using a sophisticated installer. The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with a command and control (C2) server at a specific IP address (160.20.147.254).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to specific ports to trigger the opening of a port for communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication to avoid detection by network security systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to avoid detection. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not align with the context of using non-standard ports.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to load malicious code. It is not related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1505.002-Transport Agent:** This technique involves using transport agents to modify or control the flow of network traffic. It is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication, which is explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. It aligns well with the context of establishing communication with a C2 server after defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of non-standard ports to establish communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
