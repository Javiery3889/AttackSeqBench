### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Derusbi first gathers system information about the victim's host for discovery.
   - After this, the question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur to establish communication with the command and control (C2) server via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information to understand the environment.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial step. It is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel, but it is not specific to the use of HTTP POST requests.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**
     - This technique involves injecting code into processes, which is not relevant to establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols, such as HTTP, to communicate with a C2 server. The specific sub-technique T1071.001-Web Protocols is mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the use of HTTP POST requests.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves using HTTP to communicate with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
