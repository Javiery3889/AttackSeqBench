### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about how Regin maintains communication with the C2 infrastructure after collecting data using advanced RAT features like capturing screenshots and monitoring network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication:** This technique involves duplicating network traffic to exfiltrate data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots to collect data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with the C2 server. This is a common method for maintaining communication and exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate data before exfiltration. While this can be used to maintain communication, it is more about the method of data encoding rather than the communication protocol itself.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1040-Network Sniffing:**
     - This technique involves monitoring and capturing network traffic. It is more about collecting data rather than maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting the SID history of a user to gain access to resources. It is not related to maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible answer is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** because it directly addresses how Regin maintains communication with the C2 infrastructure. After collecting data through screen capture and network monitoring, Regin would use standard application layer protocols to exfiltrate the data and maintain communication with the C2 server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
