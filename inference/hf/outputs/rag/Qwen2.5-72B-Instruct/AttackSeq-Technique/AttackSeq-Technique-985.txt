### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the InfoOS module gathered system information and the RemoteShell module listed installed applications and iPhone backups.
   - The focus is on the next step in the attack sequence after these discovery actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and other system details.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying installed software and applications on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. It is not directly related to the discovery of system information or software.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on the system. This is a logical next step after discovering system information and software, as the attacker might want to understand what processes are running to identify potential targets or to avoid detection.
   - **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input through the graphical user interface. This is more related to credential access and not directly to the discovery of system information or software.
   - **D: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic. While it can be part of the discovery process, it is more focused on network traffic rather than system and software information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most logical next step after gathering system information and listing installed applications and iPhone backups is to identify running processes. This helps the attacker understand the current state of the system and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
