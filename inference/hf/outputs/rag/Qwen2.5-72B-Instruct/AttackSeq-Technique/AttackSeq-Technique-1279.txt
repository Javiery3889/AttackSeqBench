### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Tropic Trooper exploited a Microsoft Office vulnerability to gain initial access.
   - They then downloaded and installed an MSI package.
   - The backdoor installer used BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1218.007-Msiexec:** This technique involves the use of the Windows Installer (msiexec) to execute malicious payloads. This aligns with the installation of the MSI package.
   - **T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves the use of Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs to download or execute files. This aligns with the use of BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link. While this could be part of the initial access, it does not align with the specific actions described in the question, such as using msiexec and BITSadmin.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While this could be part of the process, it is not the most specific technique for the described actions.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate programs. This does not align with the described actions of using msiexec and BITSadmin.
   - **D: T1558.001-Golden Ticket:** This technique involves creating and using Kerberos tickets. This is not relevant to the described actions.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant techniques are T1218.007-Msiexec and T1197-BITS Jobs.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`, which aligns with T1197-BITS Jobs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

However, based on the specific actions described, the most accurate answer should be T1197-BITS Jobs, but since it is not listed as an answer choice, the closest relevant technique is:

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

But for the most precise answer, it should be noted that T1197-BITS Jobs is the most relevant technique.
