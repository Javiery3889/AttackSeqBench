### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks and before the SombRAT backdoor's process discovery and system information discovery functionalities were utilized.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering running processes on a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task:** This technique involves the adversary using scheduled tasks to execute payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves the adversary using cloud accounts to gain access to systems. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves the adversary using AppInit DLLs to load malicious code. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves the adversary injecting code into running processes. This could be a plausible step after the payload is executed and before process discovery, as it allows the adversary to maintain persistence and stealth.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves the adversary obfuscating data to avoid detection. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of events is:
     1. The payload stagers are executed using scheduled tasks (T1053.005).
     2. The adversary injects code into running processes (T1055) to maintain persistence and stealth.
     3. The SombRAT backdoor is used to discover processes and system information (T1057).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1055-Process Injection
