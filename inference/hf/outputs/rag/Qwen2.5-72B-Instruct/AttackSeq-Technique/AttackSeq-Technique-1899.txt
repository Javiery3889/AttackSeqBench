### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after TeamTNT compromised the exposed Weave Scope service to gain initial access and led to the deployment and execution of the coin miner payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to execute commands or scripts.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1648-Serverless Execution:** This technique involves executing code in a serverless environment, which is not directly related to the context of deploying and executing a coin miner payload after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts, which is a common method for deploying and executing payloads.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.009-Proc Memory:** This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process, which is more related to persistence and evasion rather than the initial execution of a payload.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open services, which is more related to the initial reconnaissance phase rather than the execution of a payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, the attackers used a command and scripting interpreter to deploy and execute the coin miner payload.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
