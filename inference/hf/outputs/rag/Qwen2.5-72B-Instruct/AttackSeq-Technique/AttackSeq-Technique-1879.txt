### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor group FIN13.
   - They conducted reconnaissance by mapping victim networks and capturing credentials.
   - The next step is to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before they executed commands locally using JSPRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network services to understand the network topology.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves capturing credentials for later use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
     - While this could be a method for initial access, it does not align with the sequence described, which involves reconnaissance and credential capture.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL:**
     - This technique involves modifying a network provider DLL to capture credentials.
     - This is more aligned with credential capture but does not fit the sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1078.003-Local Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using local accounts to gain initial access.
     - Given that FIN13 has already captured credentials, using local accounts to execute commands locally is a logical next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network.
     - This is part of the reconnaissance phase, which has already been completed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before executing commands locally using JSPRAT is **T1078.003-Local Accounts**.

**Final Answer: C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
