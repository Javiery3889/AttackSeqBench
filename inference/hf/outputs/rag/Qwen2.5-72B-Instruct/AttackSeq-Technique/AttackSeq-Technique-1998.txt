### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an HTTP POST request is made to establish a connection with an external server (updaterweb[.]com).
   - The attacker then attempts to retrieve files from directories such as 'C:\Program Files' using `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`.
   - The final step mentioned is encoding collected system information for transmission.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the retrieval of files from directories.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which aligns with the use of `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using fallback channels for command and control, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves discovering running processes on the system. While this could be part of a broader attack, it is not directly related to the file and directory discovery or data collection described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system owner or user. This is not directly related to the file and directory discovery or data collection described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification:** This technique involves modifying group policies. This is not directly related to the file and directory discovery or data collection described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. This is relevant to the HTTP POST request mentioned in the question, but it does not directly precede the file and directory discovery or data collection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant technique that likely occurred before encoding collected system information for transmission is the discovery of files and directories on the system.
   - The use of `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW` aligns with the **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** technique.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
