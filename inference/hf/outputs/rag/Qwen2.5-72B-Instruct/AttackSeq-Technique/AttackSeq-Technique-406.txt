### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Gholee established communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests to /index.php.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is used to detect and avoid virtualized environments and sandboxes, which is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication. The specific sub-technique T1071.001-Web Protocols is mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the use of HTTP GET and POST requests.
   - **C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves the use of digital certificates, which is relevant to the use of an expired SSL certificate. However, it is more about the certificate itself rather than the communication protocol.
   - **D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media for communication, which is not relevant to the use of HTTP GET and POST requests over the web.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the use of HTTP GET and POST requests to /index.php is T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique is directly related to the communication method described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
