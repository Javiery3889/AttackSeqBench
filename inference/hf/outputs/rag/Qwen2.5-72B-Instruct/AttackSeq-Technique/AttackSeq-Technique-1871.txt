### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where APT28 uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique in Office products to fetch and execute a payload via PowerShell for initial access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange:** This technique involves using DDE to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands.
     - Given that the initial access was achieved using PowerShell, which is a command and scripting interpreter, it is highly likely that the next step would involve further use of PowerShell to execute additional commands or scripts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
     - This does not align well with the sequence described, as the initial access was achieved through a malicious document and PowerShell, not by exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking Security Support Provider (SSP) and Trust Provider interfaces.
     - This is a more advanced technique and does not logically follow the initial access via DDE and PowerShell.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using Component Object Model (COM) to execute commands or scripts.
     - While this could be a plausible follow-up, it is less likely than the continued use of PowerShell, which is already established in the initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique to occur after the initial access via DDE and PowerShell is the continued use of PowerShell for further command and scripting execution.

**Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
