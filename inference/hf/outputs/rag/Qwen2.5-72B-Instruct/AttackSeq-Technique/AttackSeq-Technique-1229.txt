### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Inception attackers used anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process to prevent clues from being left on disk or in the registry.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after the use of anti-forensics techniques.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves adversaries removing or altering indicators of their presence on a system to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**
     - This sub-technique is a specific method of indicator removal where adversaries delete files to remove evidence of their actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions to gain execution. It does not directly relate to removing indicators or anti-forensics.
   - **B: T1137-Office Application Startup**
     - This technique involves using Office application startup to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to removing indicators or anti-forensics.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique directly aligns with the scenario described, as it involves removing or altering indicators of the attacker's presence.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as code signing, to gain execution. It does not directly relate to removing indicators or anti-forensics.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used **T1070-Indicator Removal** after employing anti-forensics techniques.

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
