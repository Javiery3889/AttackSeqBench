### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where CozyDuke establishes persistence using techniques like manipulating registry keys, using Windows services, or employing COM-object hijacking.
   - After establishing persistence, it maintains communication with its C&C server through specified configuration details in HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to execute malicious code.
   - **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking COM objects to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1552.004-Private Keys**
     - This technique involves stealing private keys, which is not related to maintaining communication with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter) to communicate with a C&C server, which aligns with the question's description.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at boot or logon, which is related to persistence but not to maintaining communication with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to protect data, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
