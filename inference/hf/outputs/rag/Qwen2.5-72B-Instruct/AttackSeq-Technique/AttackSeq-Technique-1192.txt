### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where malicious payloads are downloaded via nefarious macros.
   - The focus is on how the RMS executable maintains contact with the threat actor's infrastructure after the initial download.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves concealing the infrastructure used by the threat actor, but it does not directly relate to maintaining contact with the infrastructure.
   - **B: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves using JavaScript to execute malicious code, but it does not specifically address maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
   - **C: T1219-Remote Access Software:** This technique involves using remote access software to maintain a persistent connection to the threat actor's infrastructure, which aligns well with the need to maintain contact.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, but it does not address maintaining contact with the infrastructure after the initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the initial download of malicious payloads via nefarious macros (T1204.002-Malicious File and T1059.005-Visual Basic).
   - After the initial download, the RMS executable would need to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
   - The technique that best fits this requirement is **T1219-Remote Access Software**, as it involves using remote access software to maintain a persistent connection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1219-Remote Access Software
