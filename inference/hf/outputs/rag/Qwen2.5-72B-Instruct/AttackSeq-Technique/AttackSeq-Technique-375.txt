### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - A dropper is executed to generate a path in the %TEMP% directory.
     - Process hollowing is performed on `msiexec.exe`.
     - The goal is to ensure that a malicious file (`ssonsvr.exe` or `srvcl32.dll`) loads during the next system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances**
     - This technique is related to network security appliances and does not fit the context of ensuring a file loads at system startup.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a program or script runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the goal of ensuring the malicious file loads during the next system startup.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating system services to achieve persistence. While it could be relevant, it is not as specific as T1547 for the described scenario.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
     - This technique is related to cloud credentials and does not fit the context of ensuring a file loads at system startup.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of ensuring a malicious file loads during the next system startup, is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
