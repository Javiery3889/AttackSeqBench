### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access through exploitation of external servers.
     - Leveraging consistent gateways like web shells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:**
     - This technique involves using web shells to maintain persistent access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services (like RDP, SSH) to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1596.004-CDNs:**
     - This technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host malicious content. It is not directly related to initial access or the exploitation of external servers.
   - **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to execute arbitrary code. It is more related to persistence and execution rather than initial access.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's network. It typically occurs after initial access has been established.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which is often done before or during the initial access phase to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker would gather information about the victim's network (T1590) before exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) to gain initial access and then use a web shell (T1505.003) to maintain persistent access.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the initial access is T1590-Gather Victim Network Information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
