### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where transaction data is intercepted using malicious scripts, sent to a collection server, and then funneled through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.
   - The focus is on identifying the technique that occurred before the exfiltration through the global network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled server.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, which aligns with the interception of transaction data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of intercepted transaction data.
   - **C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a scheduled transfer of data, which could be relevant but is not as specific to the exfiltration process described.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one intended for the data, which aligns well with the use of a global exfiltration network utilizing hijacked legitimate sites.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves intercepting transaction data, sending it to a collection server, and then exfiltrating it through a global network. The technique that most likely occurred before the final exfiltration through the global network is the exfiltration of data over an alternative protocol.
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** is the most plausible technique that fits this sequence, as it describes the method of exfiltrating data using a different protocol, which aligns with the use of hijacked legitimate sites.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
