### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique used to hide the location of the 'mothership' server during the 'Red October' campaign.
   - The main component established communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves naming or locating files, directories, or other system objects to appear legitimate.
   - **T1584.008-Network Devices**: This technique involves compromising network devices to gain access to the network.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. It is not directly related to hiding the location of a server.
   - **B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to dynamically resolve C&C server locations. This could be used to hide the location of the 'mothership' server.
   - **C: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server, which can help hide the true location of the C&C server.
   - **D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves modifying the Winlogon helper DLL to execute code at system startup. It is not directly related to hiding the location of a server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** and **C: T1090-Proxy** are the most relevant techniques for hiding the location of the 'mothership' server.
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** is particularly relevant because it dynamically resolves C&C server locations, which can be used to hide the true location of the 'mothership' server.
   - **T1090-Proxy** is also a strong candidate, but it is more about routing traffic through an intermediary server rather than dynamically resolving the server location.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver
