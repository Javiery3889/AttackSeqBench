### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlackSoul has established communication with a C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
   - The focus is on the technique used to transfer data over the C2 channel after the communication is established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves transferring data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication, which is not directly relevant to the question since the communication is already established using a standard protocol (RESTful Strapi).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket:** This technique involves obtaining and using Kerberos golden tickets to maintain long-term access to a network. It is not related to data exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves using a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not the same as the C2 protocol. This does not align with the scenario where the data is transferred over the established C2 channel.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated methods to exfiltrate data, but it does not specify the channel used for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration, but it does not describe the method of transferring the data over the C2 channel.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique based on the related TTPs and the scenario described is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This technique directly aligns with the transfer of data over the established C2 channel using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** (Correction: The correct answer should be **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**, but since it is not listed as an option, the closest match is **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**. However, the most accurate answer based on the related TTPs is **T1041**.)

**Note:** The correct answer should be **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** if it were an option. Since it is not, the closest match is **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**, but it is not the most accurate.
