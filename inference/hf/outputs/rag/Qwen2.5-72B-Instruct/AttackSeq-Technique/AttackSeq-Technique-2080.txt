### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with Initial Access through Drive-by Compromise, where users are redirected via malvertising or compromised websites.
   - The next step involves executing an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves the adversary gaining access to a system by tricking users into clicking a link or visiting a compromised website.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to download and run malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile:** This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute arbitrary code when PowerShell is launched. While this can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct method for executing an obfuscated script immediately after a drive-by compromise.
   - **B: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves scheduling tasks using cron jobs, which is more relevant to persistence and scheduled execution rather than immediate execution of a script.
   - **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities:** This technique involves acquiring tools or capabilities to support an attack, but it does not directly relate to the execution of a script.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting languages to execute commands and scripts. The sub-technique T1059.001-PowerShell specifically involves using PowerShell, which aligns with the described scenario of executing an obfuscated PowerShell script.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using PowerShell to execute the obfuscated script immediately after the drive-by compromise.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
