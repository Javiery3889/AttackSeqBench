### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the HTTPChannel module enables continuous communication with the C&C server, and then data (screenshots, passwords, and files) is encrypted with RC4 and sent in a POST request.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to encrypt data for command and control communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automated methods for exfiltrating data. However, the question specifically mentions that the data is encrypted and sent in a POST request, which is more aligned with T1041.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique fits well with the sequence described. After the C&C communication is established, the data is exfiltrated over the same channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves intercepting paths due to unquoted service paths, which is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which could be part of the data exfiltration but is not the step that occurs between establishing C&C communication and encrypting the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the C&C communication is established, the data is exfiltrated over the same channel. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
