### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has discovered MSSQL Server processes using the Inner-Loader component.
   - The focus is on bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth against logging mechanisms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This technique involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique also involves modifying the authentication process to gain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1548.001-Setuid and Setgid**: This technique involves setting the setuid and setgid bits on files to change the user or group ID of a process. This is more related to privilege escalation and does not directly address bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not specifically address modifying authentication processes.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain unauthorized access or credentials. This aligns well with the scenario of bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1127.001-MSBuild**: This technique involves using MSBuild to execute arbitrary code. It is more related to code execution and does not directly address authentication or stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1556-Modify Authentication Process**.

**Final Answer: C: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
