### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlueBravo's malware gathers system information and then establishes bidirectional communication with C2 servers using HTTPS protocol encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) for communication with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using standard encoding methods (like Base64) to obfuscate or encode data before transmission.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to route C2 traffic. While it can be used for communication, it does not specifically address the use of HTTPS and encoding.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This is a broader category that includes various application layer protocols, including web protocols. However, it is not specific enough to cover the use of HTTPS and encoding.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs:** This technique involves modifying the AppCert DLLs to execute malicious code. It is not related to C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. It is not related to C2 communication.

4. **Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most relevant techniques from the related TTPs are T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1132.001 (Standard Encoding).
   - T1071.001 specifically mentions the use of web protocols like HTTPS, which aligns with the question's description of using HTTPS for C2 communication.
   - T1132.001 mentions the use of standard encoding methods like Base64, which aligns with the question's description of using Base64 encoding.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

However, to be more precise, the most specific and relevant technique is T1071.001-Web Protocols. Since T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a broader category that includes T1071.001, the most accurate answer is:

Final Answer: T1071.001-Web Protocols (if it were an option, but since it's not, the closest is B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol)
