### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a command-and-control (C2) connection is established, and then additional modules are injected into device memory and periodic malware updates are performed to maintain the botnet.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which is not directly relevant to the C2 connection and module injection described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over the infected device, which aligns with the C2 connection and periodic updates.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into network traffic, which could be relevant to the injection of additional modules into device memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique involves smuggling malicious content within HTML, which is not directly related to the C2 connection and module injection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services, which is not directly related to the C2 connection and module injection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into network traffic, which aligns with the injection of additional modules into device memory.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules to maintain persistence and functionality, which is relevant to the injection of additional modules and periodic updates.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the injection of additional modules into device memory and periodic malware updates, which aligns with the technique T1129-Shared Modules.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
