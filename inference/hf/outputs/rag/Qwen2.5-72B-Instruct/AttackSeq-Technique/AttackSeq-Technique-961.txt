### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a batch script is used to deploy an RMS client via a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX).
   - The focus is on maintaining the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves modifying registry run keys or the startup folder to ensure that the malicious software runs at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence by executing code at system boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system by having them visit a malicious website. This does not fit the context of modifying system startup configurations.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broad category that includes various methods to achieve persistence. It aligns with the goal of maintaining the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves exploiting unquoted service paths to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to modifying system startup configurations.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files. While it could be part of the initial infection, it does not fit the context of maintaining persistence by modifying system startup configurations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of maintaining the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations, is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
