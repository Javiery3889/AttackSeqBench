### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.
   - The sequence includes gathering information on network and host configurations, targeting user accounts, and then using WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - We need to identify the technique that supports targeting user accounts within victim networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves using web shells to maintain persistence and execute commands on the web server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the user or owner of a system, which is crucial for targeting user accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains, which is useful for understanding the network topology but not directly for targeting user accounts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves modifying authentication modules, which is more related to persistence and privilege escalation rather than discovering user accounts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is useful for gathering sensitive information but not specifically for targeting user accounts.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves identifying user accounts and their properties, which is directly relevant to targeting user accounts within victim networks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique for targeting user accounts is **T1087-Account Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery**
