### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the SBDH malware has already executed and downloaded a backdoor and a data stealer.
   - The next step is to ensure that the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited on the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is relevant to the initial infection but not to the persistence mechanism we are looking for.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1137-Office Application Startup:**
     - This technique involves modifying Office application settings to run malicious code when an Office application (like Word) is started. This aligns well with the requirement to run the malware whenever a Word document is opened or edited.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems. It is not related to ensuring malware runs when a Word document is opened.
   - **C: T1559.001-Component Object Model:**
     - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about ensuring malware runs when a Word document is opened.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves automatically collecting data from the system. It is not related to ensuring malware runs when a Word document is opened.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique to ensure the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited is **T1137-Office Application Startup**.

**Final Answer: A: T1137-Office Application Startup**
