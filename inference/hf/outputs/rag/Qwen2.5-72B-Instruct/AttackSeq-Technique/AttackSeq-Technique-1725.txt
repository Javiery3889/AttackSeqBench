### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' were used for lateral movement and mapping the network.
   - The focus is on the establishment of communication channels to maintain persistence within compromised networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves using a web shell to maintain persistence. A web shell is a script that provides a web-based interface for attackers to execute commands on the server.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to maintain access to a network.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a compromised system. While this could be a part of the attack, it does not directly relate to maintaining persistence or establishing communication channels.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol, often to bypass network security measures. This could be used to maintain communication channels, but it is not the most direct match for the given context.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves collecting and analyzing log files to gather information. This is not directly related to maintaining persistence or establishing communication channels.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. This could be used to maintain communication channels, but it is not the most direct match for the given context.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining persistence and establishing communication channels is **T1505.003-Web Shell**. A web shell provides a persistent backdoor that allows attackers to maintain access and communicate with the compromised system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1505.003-Web Shell**
