### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred as part of the Defense Evasion tactic after an AMSI bypass using a DLL in PowerShell and before establishing command and control through njRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1565-Data Manipulation:** This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, which is not directly related to the context of AMSI bypass or command and control.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or other elements to avoid detection, which is relevant to defense evasion.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection, which is also relevant to defense evasion.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not directly related to the context of AMSI bypass or command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that an AMSI bypass method using a DLL in PowerShell was used. This aligns with **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**.
   - After bypassing AMSI, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to hide the malicious activity to avoid detection. This aligns with **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities** could also be a plausible step, but it is less likely to be the immediate next step after an AMSI bypass and before establishing command and control.
   - **T1565-Data Manipulation** and **T1566-Phishing** are not directly relevant to the context of the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts
