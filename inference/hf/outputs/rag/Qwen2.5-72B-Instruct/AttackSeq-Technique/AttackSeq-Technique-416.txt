### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the malware uses scheduled tasks to maintain persistence and then communicates with its C2 server using HTTP requests and a covert mechanism.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for communication with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is not related to C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for communication, which aligns with the use of HTTP requests to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves tunneling one protocol inside another to evade detection, which could be a covert mechanism but is not as directly relevant as T1071 in this context.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of HTTP requests and a covert mechanism for C2 communication, is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
