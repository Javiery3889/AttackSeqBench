### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Dragonfly conducted reconnaissance using various methods (spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits) to gather information.
   - After reconnaissance, they gained initial access to energy companies using spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending emails to victims to trick them into performing an action, such as clicking a link or opening an attachment.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique involves sending emails with links that lead to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This sub-technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information from victims. This aligns with the reconnaissance phase described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This is the same as Answer Choice A.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise. This does not fit the sequence described, as it typically occurs after gaining access and establishing a foothold.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate:** This technique involves installing a root certificate to enable man-in-the-middle attacks. This is not relevant to the reconnaissance or initial access phases described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Dragonfly conducted **Phishing for Information (T1598)** after reconnaissance and before gaining initial access using spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.

**Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
