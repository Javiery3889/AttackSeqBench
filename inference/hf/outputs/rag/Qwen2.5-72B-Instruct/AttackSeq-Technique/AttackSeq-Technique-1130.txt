### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method using an exploit in MS Office documents (CVE-2014-1761) to gain entry into a system.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to have been used to bypass standard detection methods after gaining initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like MS Office) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment that, when opened, exploits a vulnerability to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain remote access to a system. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not typically used to bypass detection methods.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves altering the appearance of files or information to avoid detection by security tools. This is a common method used by malware to bypass standard detection methods.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying a container to run malicious code. While it can be used to isolate and run malware, it is not typically used to bypass detection methods.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it is related to the initial access method, it does not address the question of bypassing detection methods after gaining access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible technique to bypass standard detection methods after gaining initial access through an exploit is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
