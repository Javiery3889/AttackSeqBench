### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Grandoreiro collected information about its victims, such as computer name, username, operating system version, and bitness.
   - The collection of this information is part of the **Discovery** tactic, specifically the **T1082-System Information Discovery** technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the **Discovery** tactic and the **T1082-System Information Discovery** technique are relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute code. It is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a command and control server. This is a plausible next step after collecting system information, as the attacker would need to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate next step after collecting system information.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After collecting system information, the most logical next step for an attacker would be to exfiltrate that information to a command and control server. This is typically done using application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
