### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Korplug malware has already gathered system information and network details such as uptime, Windows version, and CPU clock rate.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to access and collect data from shared resources within the target's network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering the system time, which is not directly related to accessing shared resources.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary gathering system information, which aligns with the initial steps described in the question (gathering system information and network details).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1555.002-Securityd Memory:** This technique involves stealing credentials from the memory of the `securityd` process, which is not relevant to accessing shared resources.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs and describes the initial step of gathering system information, not the next step of accessing shared resources.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves the adversary collecting data from network shared drives, which aligns with the next step of accessing and collecting data from shared resources.
   - **D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which is not directly related to accessing shared resources.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is that after gathering system information, the next step is to access and collect data from shared resources within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
