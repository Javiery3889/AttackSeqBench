### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved lateral movement by exploiting vulnerabilities like MS08-067 and MS10-061.
   - After lateral movement, the attacker needs to send data and receive commands or updates from predefined URLs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems.
   - **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1608.002 - Upload Tool:** This technique involves uploading a tool to a remote system. While this could be part of the lateral movement, it doesn't directly address sending data or receiving commands from URLs.
   - **B: T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain elevated privileges or bypass security mechanisms. It is not directly related to sending data or receiving commands from URLs.
   - **C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with remote systems. This is a strong candidate because it directly addresses sending data and receiving commands over the network.
   - **D: T1001.003 - Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to avoid detection. While it can be used to mask communication, it doesn't directly address the need to send data and receive commands from URLs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using standard application layer protocols (T1071) to send data and receive commands or updates from predefined URLs. This aligns well with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
