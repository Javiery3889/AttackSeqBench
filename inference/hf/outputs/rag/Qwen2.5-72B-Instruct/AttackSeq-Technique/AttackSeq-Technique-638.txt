### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Moafee and DragonOK groups used custom-built backdoors and RATs to maintain access to victim networks.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads using a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by performing actions at specific times or intervals.
   - **T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system environment to determine if it is a suitable target for the attack or to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
     - This technique involves modifying or replacing legitimate host software binaries to include malicious functionality. While this could be used to maintain access, it does not directly relate to the 'CPU core check' for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content. This is typically used for initial access, not for maintaining access or evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a broader category of phishing techniques, which includes spearphishing. Like B, it is used for initial access and not for maintaining access or evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
     - This technique involves developing or acquiring new tools, techniques, or capabilities. This could be relevant to the development of custom-built backdoors and RATs, but it does not directly relate to the 'CPU core check' for evasion.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The 'CPU core check' for evasion is a form of system check, which aligns with **T1497.001-System Checks**.
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the execution of the payloads, and the most plausible sequence would involve checking the system environment (T1497.001) before executing the payloads to ensure the environment is suitable and to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1497.001-System Checks** (Answer Choice D is not the correct choice, but the most relevant technique is T1497.001, which is not listed in the answer choices. However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest is D, but it is not the most accurate.) 

Given the options, the closest and most relevant answer is:
Final Answer: **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities** (though it is not the most accurate, it is the closest in the context of the question).
