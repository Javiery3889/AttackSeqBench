### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aurora malware:
     - Achieved persistence by installing itself as a service under random names and modifying registry keys.
     - Modified the file-time of the dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to achieve persistence. This aligns with the malware installing itself as a service under random names and modifying registry keys.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp:**
     - This technique involves modifying the file system timestamps (creation, modification, access) to make the files appear as if they were created or modified at different times, often to match legitimate system files. This aligns with the malware modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts:**
     - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network traffic to avoid detection. While it is related to evasion, it does not specifically mention modifying file timestamps.
   - **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to execute it in the context of that process. It is not related to modifying file timestamps.
   - **C: T1569-System Services:**
     - This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence. While it aligns with the initial part of the question, it does not cover the file-time modification.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect or understand. It is not specifically related to modifying file timestamps.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the one that involves modifying file timestamps to evade detection. This aligns with the technique T1070.006-Timestomp.

**Final Answer: B: T1070.006-Timestomp**
