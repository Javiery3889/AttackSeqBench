### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after APT33 conducted reconnaissance using private VPN exit nodes but before they issued commands to bots through their private VPN network.
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Reconnaissance using private VPN exit nodes.
     2. (Unknown technique we need to identify).
     3. Issuing commands to bots through the private VPN network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., SSH, RDP) to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves maintaining access to a network by using external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process using an asynchronous procedure call (APC). This is typically used for process injection and is more relevant to the execution phase rather than the initial access or reconnaissance phase.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering remote systems and their network topology. This is a logical step after reconnaissance and before issuing commands to bots, as it helps the attacker understand the network structure.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. This is more relevant to the execution phase to avoid detection by security tools.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network. While it is a common initial access technique, it does not fit the sequence described in the question, which already mentions reconnaissance using private VPN exit nodes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred after reconnaissance and before issuing commands to bots is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**. This technique helps the attacker understand the network topology, which is essential before issuing commands to bots.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
