### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before FastPOS uploaded stolen information to a C&C server using GET commands.
   - The focus is on the sequence of events leading up to the exfiltration of data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C&C server over a command and control channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical methods (e.g., USB drives). This does not fit the context of FastPOS using GET commands to exfiltrate data.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes. While this is a common technique for collecting data, it does not directly precede the exfiltration step described in the question.
   - **C: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32 utility to execute code. This is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C&C channel, which aligns with the description of FastPOS using GET commands to upload stolen information.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of events likely involves:
     1. **Collection of Data:** FastPOS collects and stages the stolen data (e.g., keystrokes and RAM scraper data) on the local system.
     2. **Exfiltration of Data:** FastPOS then exfiltrates the staged data to a C&C server using GET commands.

   - The technique that most likely occurred before the exfiltration is **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred before the exfiltration using GET commands, which is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
