### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Milum Trojan transmitted compressed and encrypted JSON data via HTTP POST requests for C2 communication.
   - The key points are:
     - The Trojan is transmitting data.
     - The data is compressed and encrypted.
     - The data is sent via HTTP POST requests.
     - The focus is on the C2 (Command and Control) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it before transmission, which can include compression and encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. It is not directly related to the C2 communication described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.001-Web Protocols:**
     - This technique is directly related to the use of HTTP POST requests for C2 communication, which is mentioned in the question. However, it does not address the encoding of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves compromising third-party infrastructure to support C2 operations. It is not directly related to the encoding or transmission of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1132-Data Encoding:**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it before transmission, which aligns with the description of compressing and encrypting JSON data before sending it via HTTP POST requests.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the data was encoded (compressed and encrypted) before it was transmitted via HTTP POST requests for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the transmission is **T1132-Data Encoding**.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
