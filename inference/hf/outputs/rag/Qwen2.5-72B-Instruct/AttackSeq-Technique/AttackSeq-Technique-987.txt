### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by XAgent.
   - Specifically, it asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before XAgent gathered details about file and directory structures on the infected system.
   - The context is that XAgent has already obtained credentials from Firefox browser profiles.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique describes how an adversary can obtain credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the initial action of XAgent obtaining credentials from Firefox.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves an adversary gathering information about file and directory structures on the infected system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it could be part of a broader attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of obtaining credentials and then discovering file and directory structures.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a broader category and could include file and directory discovery. However, it is not as specific as T1083.
   - **C: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion**: This technique involves using mutual exclusion (mutex) to prevent multiple instances of the malware from running. It is not directly related to the sequence of obtaining credentials and discovering file and directory structures.
   - **D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique directly involves gathering information about file and directory structures on the infected system, which is the next logical step after obtaining credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is that T1083-File and Directory Discovery occurred after XAgent obtained credentials from Firefox browser profiles.

**Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
