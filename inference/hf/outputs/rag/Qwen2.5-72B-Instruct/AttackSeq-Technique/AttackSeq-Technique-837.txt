### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where WinDealer processes and encrypts data before exfiltration.
   - It then asks about the technique used to maintain communication with the C2 server using specific ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the application layer, such as raw sockets or custom protocols, to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using ports that are not commonly associated with standard services. The question mentions specific non-standard ports (UDP 6999 and TCP 55556), which aligns with this technique.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect the data in transit. While the question mentions encryption (AES), this technique is more about the communication channel itself being encrypted, not the specific ports used.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves discovering software installed on the system, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves using digital certificates, which is not mentioned in the question and is not relevant to the communication ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is **T1571-Non-Standard Port**. This technique directly addresses the use of non-standard ports for communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
