### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Trickbot gains initial access to a victim's system through spam emails containing a Microsoft Word document with an enabled macro.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique describes the use of spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique describes the execution of a malicious file, such as a Word document with an enabled macro, to execute code on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and executing a malicious file.
   - **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile:** This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute arbitrary code. This is a more advanced technique that might be used later in the attack lifecycle.
   - **C: T1609-Container Administration Command:** This technique involves the use of commands to manage containers. This is not typically a next step after initial access and is more relevant to specific environments where containers are used.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the transfer of additional tools or malware to the victim's system. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and executing a malicious file.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - After gaining initial access through a spearphishing attachment and executing a malicious file, the next logical step is to execute commands or scripts to further the attack. This aligns with **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.
   - While **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** is also a plausible next step, it typically follows the execution of commands and scripts to set up the environment for tool transfer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
