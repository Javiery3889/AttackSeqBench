### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance, leverages compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB, and then performs lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network.
   - The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the lateral movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to access and control remote systems, often through administrative shares.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This technique involves gathering information about cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the described lateral movement over SMB.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting identity information from the victim, which is more related to reconnaissance rather than lateral movement.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services:** This is a broader category that includes various methods of remote access, including SMB/Windows Admin Shares.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for remote access, which is not relevant to the described SMB-based lateral movement.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique to the described lateral movement over SMB is **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**. This technique directly aligns with the use of compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB and perform lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services

However, for even more precision, the most specific technique is **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**. Since this is not an answer choice, the closest and most appropriate answer is **C: T1021-Remote Services**.
