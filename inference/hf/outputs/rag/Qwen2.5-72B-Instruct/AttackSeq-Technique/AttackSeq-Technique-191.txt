### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where files are collected from the local system and application directories and then exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - The focus is on the exfiltration technique used after the collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial part of the question where files are collected.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could include using Tor and SSH.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection, which is not directly related to exfiltration but could be part of the overall attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automated exfiltration, which is a broad term and could include various methods of exfiltration. However, it does not specifically mention the use of a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This is a duplicate of Answer Choice A and does not provide additional information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the location of the system, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood:** This technique involves exhausting the operating system resources, which is a form of denial of service (DoS) and is not related to exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible answer is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** because it specifically involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which can include using Tor and SSH connections.

**Final Answer: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
