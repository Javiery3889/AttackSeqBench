### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information as part of reconnaissance. The next step involves leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service:** This technique involves using a service to send spearphishing messages to targets.
   - **T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials from various sources.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing messages with links to malicious websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059.002-AppleScript**
     - This technique involves using AppleScript to execute arbitrary code. It does not fit the context of reconnaissance or credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**
     - This technique involves creating and using Kerberos service tickets. It is more relevant to post-compromise activities and does not fit the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is part of reconnaissance but does not directly relate to stealing personal contact information or harvesting credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**
     - This technique involves creating fake web credentials, which aligns with the use of HTTPS landing pages to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information (reconnaissance), followed by forging web credentials to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails (credential harvesting).

**Final Answer: D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**
