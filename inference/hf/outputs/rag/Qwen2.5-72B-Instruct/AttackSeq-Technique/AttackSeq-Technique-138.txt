### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after lateral movement and before HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.
   - Lateral movement is already established, and the next step is communication with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate further attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall:** This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of lateral movement followed by HTTP GET requests.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application. This is typically an initial access technique and does not fit the sequence of events after lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. The specific sub-technique T1071.001-Web Protocols is directly related to using HTTP for C2 communication, which fits the sequence of events after lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels for communication. While this could be used for C2, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit as well as T1071.001.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after lateral movement, the attackers used HTTP GET requests to communicate with compromised systems. The technique that best fits this sequence is T1071.001-Web Protocols.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
