### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the adversary has already staged and encrypted sensitive data from mailboxes and network shares for exfiltration.
   - The adversary has used C2 encapsulated in HTTPS for smaller data transfers.
   - We need to determine the next step in the exfiltration process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique is part of the Collection tactic and involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is part of the Exfiltration tactic and involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2).
   - **T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique is also part of the Exfiltration tactic and involves exfiltrating data over an asymmetric encrypted protocol that is not the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1011-Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a different network medium, which is not specified in the question. It is less specific and does not align well with the context of using HTTPS for smaller data transfers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is part of the Discovery tactic and involves gathering system information. It does not fit the context of exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which could be a plausible next step after using C2 over HTTPS for smaller data transfers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: This technique is part of the Collection tactic and involves searching for victim-owned websites. It does not fit the context of exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after staging and encrypting data and using C2 over HTTPS for smaller data transfers is to exfiltrate the data over a web service.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
