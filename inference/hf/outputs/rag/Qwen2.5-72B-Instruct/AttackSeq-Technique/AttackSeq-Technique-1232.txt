### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Inception attackers use POWERSHOWER to set up persistence by writing a script to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a registry run key.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves collecting system details on the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique is used for persistence by adding a registry key to ensure the script runs at startup.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence at boot or logon, including registry run keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not relevant to collecting system details on an already infected machine.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software, which aligns with the next step of collecting system details.
   - **C: T1652-Device Driver Discovery**: This technique involves identifying device drivers on the system, which is not directly related to collecting general system details.
   - **D: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to achieve persistence, which is not relevant to collecting system details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is to collect system information to understand the environment better and plan further actions.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
