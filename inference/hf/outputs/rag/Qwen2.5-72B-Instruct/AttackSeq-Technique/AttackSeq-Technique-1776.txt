### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where phishing emails are used to achieve initial access.
   - The next step involves the Sayad malware ensuring it embeds all required malicious components without downloading additional content.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**
   - **Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing emails with links to achieve initial access to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1588.004-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malware, which is not directly related to embedding all required components without downloading additional content.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. This could be relevant if the malware is obfuscating its components to ensure they are not detected.
   - **C: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves enumerating logs to gather information, which is not directly related to embedding all required components.
   - **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
     - This technique involves staging capabilities, which means preparing and organizing the necessary components for the attack. This is directly related to ensuring that the malware embeds all required components without downloading additional content.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Sayad malware would stage its capabilities to ensure it embeds all required components without downloading additional content.

**Final Answer: D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
