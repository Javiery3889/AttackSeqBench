### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Welcome Chat app exfiltrated various types of data (SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recorded calls, and GPS data) from the victim device.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the exfiltration of data from the victim device.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for sending stolen data back to the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications, which is relevant to the exfiltration of SMS messages and call logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the location of the system, which is not directly related to exfiltration. It is more about gathering information about the system's location.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is not directly related to exfiltration. It is more about manipulating security controls.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate, which could be used for exfiltration but is not as specific as T1041.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves tunneling protocols to hide communications, which could be used for exfiltration but is not as specific as T1041.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of exfiltrating data from the victim device, is the use of a C2 channel to send the data back to the attacker. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most specific and relevant technique for exfiltration over a C2 channel is T1041. Therefore, the correct final answer should be:

**Final Answer: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
