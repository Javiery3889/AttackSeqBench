### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises, resulting in the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code on the target system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
   - These TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing, specifically spear-phishing with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
     - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for lateral movement or remote command execution. It is not directly related to the initial execution of malware on the target system.
   - **B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
     - This technique involves leveraging trusted relationships between systems or organizations to gain access. It is not directly related to the execution of malware on the target system.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
     - This technique involves configuring system features to execute code when certain events occur. This could be used to maintain persistence or ensure that the malware (Poison Ivy) runs automatically after the initial access.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs and is the initial access method. The question is asking about what happens after the initial access, so this is not the correct answer.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing, the attacker would use **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** to ensure that the Poison Ivy server code is executed on the target system.

**Final Answer: C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
