### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Babar's dropper reduces forensic artifacts by executing a command line through spawning a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from disk.
   - The key action here is the deletion of the dropper binary, which is a form of defense evasion to reduce forensic evidence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic:** Defense Evasion
     - **Technique:** T1070.004-File Deletion
   - This indicates that the primary technique in question is the deletion of files to evade detection and forensic analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1555.001-Keychain**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from keychain storage, which is not related to file deletion or defense evasion.
   - **B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up a mechanism to execute code when a specific event occurs, which is not directly related to file deletion.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection, which is a broader category that could include file deletion but is not specific enough.
   - **D: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**
     - This technique involves smuggling malicious content within HTML files, which is not related to file deletion or defense evasion.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique to the described action of deleting the dropper binary is **T1070.004-File Deletion**. This technique is part of the Defense Evasion tactic and directly involves the deletion of files to reduce forensic artifacts.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts

However, based on the specific action described (deleting the dropper binary), the most precise answer should be **T1070.004-File Deletion**. Since this is not one of the provided choices, the closest and most relevant answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
