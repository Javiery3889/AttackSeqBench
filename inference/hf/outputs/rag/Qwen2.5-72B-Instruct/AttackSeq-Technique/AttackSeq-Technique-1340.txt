### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses anti-analysis techniques (custom packer and virtual machine) and then downloads second stage shellcode from a specified URL for further control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is used to detect and avoid virtualized environments and sandboxes, which are often used for malware analysis.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves downloading and executing additional tools or payloads from a remote system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol, often to bypass network security controls. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a common technique in defense evasion, it does not fit the specific sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate content to manipulate or control the target. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves downloading and executing additional tools or payloads from a remote system. This fits the sequence of actions described in the question, where the attacker downloads second stage shellcode from a specified URL.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
