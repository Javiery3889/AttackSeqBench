### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor "Blind Eagle."
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
     - Achieving persistence with a VBScript placed in the Startup folder.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:**
     - This technique involves achieving persistence by placing a script in the Startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1559.001-Component Object Model:**
     - This technique involves using COM to execute commands or scripts. It could be used to execute PowerShell commands, but it is not a common step between executing PowerShell and achieving persistence.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. It is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell or achieving persistence.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules:**
     - This technique involves using shared modules to load and execute code. It is not a common step between executing PowerShell and achieving persistence.
   - **D: T1218.007-Msiexec:**
     - This technique involves using the Windows Installer (msiexec) to execute code. It could be used to execute additional scripts or commands, which might be a plausible step between executing PowerShell and achieving persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence would involve using a method to execute additional code or scripts after the initial PowerShell execution and before placing the VBScript in the Startup folder.
   - **T1218.007-Msiexec** fits this context well, as it can be used to execute additional scripts or commands, which could be a logical step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1218.007-Msiexec
