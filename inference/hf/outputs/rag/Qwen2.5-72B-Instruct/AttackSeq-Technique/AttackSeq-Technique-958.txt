### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through exploiting Google Chrome, followed by privilege escalation using specific vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before PuzzleMaker used the Stager module to contact the C&C server for further payload delivery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application (in this case, Google Chrome) to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in the operating system (in this case, the Windows kernel) to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment. This is typically done after initial access and privilege escalation.
   - **B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the attack sequence. It is used to gain higher privileges after initial access.
   - **C: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code. This is typically used for persistence and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **D: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in the target system. This is typically done before the initial access to identify potential entry points.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Initial access through exploiting Google Chrome (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
     2. Privilege escalation using vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation).
     3. Using the Stager module to contact the C&C server for further payload delivery.
   - Before contacting the C&C server, the attacker would likely need to transfer additional tools or payloads to the compromised system. This aligns with the technique T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
