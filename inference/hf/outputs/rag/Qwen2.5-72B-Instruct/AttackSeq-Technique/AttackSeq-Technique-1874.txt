### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) to evade detection and communicate with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves using web services to establish bidirectional communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from files, which is not relevant to the communication with C2 servers using web services.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, but it does not specifically address the communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1001.002-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other files or data streams, which is not directly related to using web services for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services (like Pastebin or Google+) to communicate with C2 servers, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
