### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Emissary Trojan:
     - It achieved persistence by writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll`.
     - It installed as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain'.
     - It communicated with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.003-Windows Service (Persistence):** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to execute malicious code.
   - **T1505.004-IIS Components (Persistence):** This technique involves using IIS components to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. While it is a form of persistence, the question specifically mentions the use of a Windows service, which is more accurately described by T1543.003.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with C2 servers. This aligns with the part of the question where the Trojan communicates with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting client-side applications to execute code. This does not fit the context of the question, which is about persistence and C2 communication.
   - **D: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted. While this could be relevant in a broader context, the question specifically mentions the use of HTTP, which is a primary communication method, not a fallback.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of HTTP for C2 communication, which is covered by T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
