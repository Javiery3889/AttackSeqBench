### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique used to gain entry to systems via an altered Polish Financial Supervision Authority website.
   - The malware then manipulates service names and installs DLLs, but this is a subsequent step and not the focus of the question.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique fits the scenario where the Polish Financial Supervision Authority website was altered. It suggests that a vulnerability in the website's application was exploited to gain initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:**
     - This technique is not related to initial access but rather to discovering network connections after gaining access, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller:**
     - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller, which is not relevant to the scenario of a compromised website.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access, which is not relevant to the scenario of a compromised website.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

**Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
