### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the GroundPeony threat group.
   - The sequence starts with spear-phishing emails containing obfuscated URLs to deliver malicious payloads.
   - The sequence ends with the use of DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations to evade defense mechanisms.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique is used to execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves altering the appearance of code or data to make it harder to analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil:** This technique involves using the .NET Framework utility InstallUtil to execute arbitrary code. It is often used for initial access or execution but does not fit well between spear-phishing and DLL side-loading.
   - **B: T1053.002-At:** This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. It is used for persistence and execution but does not align well with the context of evading defenses.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. It is used for command and control but does not fit well between spear-phishing and DLL side-loading.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules (e.g., DLLs) to execute code. It is closely related to DLL side-loading and can be used to load malicious code into a legitimate process, which aligns well with the context of evading defenses.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the initial spear-phishing and delivery of the payload, the attacker would use shared modules (T1129) to load the malicious code into a legitimate process. This step would then be followed by DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations to further evade defenses.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
