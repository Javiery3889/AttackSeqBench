### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where data are staged for exfiltration by scanning for files with specific extensions and creating a file containing paths of all files to retrieve.
   - After this, the data are hex-encoded and encrypted for transmission to a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels when the primary C2 channel is unavailable. This aligns with the mention of a fallback C&C server in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is not relevant to the described sequence of data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication:** This technique involves modifying multi-factor authentication to gain access, which is not relevant to the data exfiltration process.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions that the data are transmitted to a fallback C&C server, which aligns with the use of fallback channels (T1008).
   - The other answer choices do not fit the context of the described sequence of actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels
