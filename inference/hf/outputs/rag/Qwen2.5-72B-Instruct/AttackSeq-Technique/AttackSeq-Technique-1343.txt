### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique used by the attackers before they executed the backdoor using DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application.
   - The focus is on gaining initial access to the victim's network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
   - These TTPs are related to the execution phase of the attack, specifically how the attackers maintained persistence and evaded detection by using DLL side-loading and COM hijacking.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. It is more relevant to the command and control phase, not the initial access phase.
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick victims into providing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their systems. This could be a plausible initial access method.
   - **C: T1187-Forced Authentication**
     - This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a service or system, often by intercepting or manipulating authentication requests. It is less likely to be the initial access method in this context.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. This is a common method for initial access and aligns well with the context of the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice** and **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** are the most plausible initial access methods.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is more commonly used in initial access scenarios, especially in targeted attacks like those involving ShadowPad.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
