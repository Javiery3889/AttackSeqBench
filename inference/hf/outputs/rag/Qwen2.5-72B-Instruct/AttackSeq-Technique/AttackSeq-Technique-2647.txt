### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has established command and control (C2) using FTP and HTTP, encrypted data with AES, and then exfiltrated data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file was present.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
   - **T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using USB drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 channel using asymmetric encryption. However, the question specifies that the data was exfiltrated using removable drives, not over a network protocol.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the screen, which is not related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is not related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical media, such as USB drives, which aligns with the description in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**.

**Final Answer: D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
