### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the GreyEnergy malware:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Deploying selected modules to selected targets and partially encrypting these modules using AES-256.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Using internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to the external C&C server on the internet for Lateral Movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using internal proxies to route C2 traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which is not directly related to the described sequence of deploying modules and using internal proxies.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.002-Hidden Users**
     - This technique involves creating hidden users to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which aligns with the described action of partially encrypting modules using AES-256.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584.008-Network Devices**
     - This technique involves targeting network devices, which is not directly related to the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is:
     - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (specifically T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File) occurred after the deployment of selected modules and before using internal C&C proxies.

### Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
