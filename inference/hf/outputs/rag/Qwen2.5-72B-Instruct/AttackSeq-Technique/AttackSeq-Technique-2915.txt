### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker gains domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz for privilege escalation and then steals a VPN certificate for remote network access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the theft of the VPN certificate.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys:** This technique involves stealing private keys, which can be used to authenticate or decrypt data.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access and escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078-Valid Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access and escalate privileges. Given that the attacker already gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, this technique is relevant but not the most specific to the context of stealing a VPN certificate.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1003.007-Proc Filesystem:**
     - This technique involves credential dumping from the process file system, which is not directly related to the theft of a VPN certificate.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1600-Weaken Encryption:**
     - This technique involves weakening encryption to gain access, which is not directly related to the theft of a VPN certificate.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is directly related to the theft of a VPN certificate for remote network access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used valid accounts (T1078) to gain domain administrator credentials and then stole a VPN certificate (T1649) for remote network access.

**Final Answer: D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
