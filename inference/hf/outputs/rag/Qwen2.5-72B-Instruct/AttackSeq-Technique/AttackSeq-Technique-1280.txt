### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Tropic Trooper, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence involves the execution of an MSI package to drop and configure files, followed by the use of a malicious loader to perform DLL hijacking and inject a DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process by loading a dynamic-link library (DLL).
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL, causing the system to load the malicious DLL instead.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using a command shell to execute commands. While it could be used to execute the MSI package, it is not directly related to the DLL hijacking and injection described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. It is not relevant to the sequence of actions described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, or other artifacts to avoid detection. While it could be used to hide the malicious DLL, it is not a necessary step before the DLL hijacking and injection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves loading a shared module (DLL) into a process. This is closely related to the DLL hijacking and injection described in the question. Specifically, the malicious loader would use this technique to load the malicious DLL into `dllhost.exe`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malicious loader used the **T1129-Shared Modules** technique to load the malicious DLL into `dllhost.exe` after the MSI package was executed to drop and configure files.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
