### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus Group:
     - Initial access: Spear-phishing campaign with macro-embedded documents masquerading as job opportunities.
     - Persistence: Dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.
   - We need to identify the technique that likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link:** This technique is used for initial access, which aligns with the spear-phishing campaign described in the question.
   - **T1547.009 - Shortcut Modification:** This technique is used for persistence, which aligns with the dropping of a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.011 - Extra Window Memory Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the memory of another process. It is typically used for process manipulation and evasion, not for the transition from initial access to persistence.
   - **B: T1134.001 - Token Impersonation/Theft:** This technique involves stealing and using access tokens to gain higher privileges. While it can be used after initial access, it is not directly related to the transition to persistence by dropping a LNK file.
   - **C: T1057 - Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. It is often used to gather information about the environment but is not directly related to the transition to persistence.
   - **D: T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a program or system to execute malicious code. This can include modifying shortcuts, which aligns with the dropping of a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. Initial access via spear-phishing with macro-embedded documents.
     2. **Hijack Execution Flow** by modifying shortcuts to ensure persistence.
     3. Dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder for persistence.
   - **T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow** is the technique that fits best between the initial access and the persistence mechanism described.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow
