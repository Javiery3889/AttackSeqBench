### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after SideCopy used malicious LNK files and before deploying various RATs and plugins.
   - The sequence of events is: 
     1. Malicious LNK files were used.
     2. Some technique occurred.
     3. Various RATs and plugins (including file enumerators and credential-stealers) were deployed.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves executing a malicious file, which aligns with the use of malicious LNK files.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system, which is a common step before deploying file enumerators and credential-stealers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a supply chain to deliver malware. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious files or programs to avoid detection. While it could be relevant, it is not the most likely step between using malicious LNK files and deploying RATs.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using network traffic to signal or control malware. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. While it could be a method to deliver the initial malicious LNK files, it is not the most likely step between using malicious LNK files and deploying RATs.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. Malicious LNK files are used to execute the initial payload.
     2. The attacker then discovers files and directories on the system to understand the environment and identify valuable data.
     3. Based on the discovered information, the attacker deploys various RATs and plugins.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1036-Masquerading**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most appropriate answer based on the sequence and the related TTPs is:

Final Answer: **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** (which is not one of the provided answer choices, but the closest match in the context of the question is **B: T1036-Masquerading**). 

Given the choices, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: **B: T1036-Masquerading**
