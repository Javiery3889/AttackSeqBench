### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Suckfly group:
     - They used the Nidiran backdoor and hacktools signed with stolen digital certificates to infect internal hosts.
     - They then scanned the internal network for open ports to expand their foothold.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Discovery**
     - **Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
   - This technique involves identifying network services and their versions, which is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering cloud services, which is not directly related to the internal network scanning described in the question.
   - **B: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not relevant to the network discovery and scanning described in the question.
   - **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which could be a plausible step but is not directly related to network discovery.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels for communication, which is not directly related to network discovery and scanning.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique that fits between the infection of internal hosts and the scanning of the internal network for open ports is **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. This technique aligns with the discovery phase and is directly related to identifying network services, which is a necessary step before scanning for open ports.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**

However, based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most appropriate answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1046-Network Service Discovery** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant technique based on the context.) 

Given the provided choices, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
