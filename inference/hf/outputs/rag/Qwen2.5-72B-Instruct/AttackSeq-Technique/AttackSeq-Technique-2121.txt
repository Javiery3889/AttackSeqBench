### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where malicious payloads like SodaMaster are executed using DESLoader through DLL side-loading.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves maintaining a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves the Persistence tactic and the specific technique T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading.
   - DLL side-loading is a technique used to execute malicious code by loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials:**
     - This technique involves adding additional credentials to cloud services, which is not directly related to maintaining a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at regular intervals. This aligns well with the requirement to execute legitimate executable files every 15 minutes to maintain persistence.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which is more related to defense evasion rather than maintaining a foothold.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account:**
     - This technique involves creating new accounts, which is not directly related to the execution of legitimate executable files at regular intervals.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using T1053-Scheduled Task/Job to maintain a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

**Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
