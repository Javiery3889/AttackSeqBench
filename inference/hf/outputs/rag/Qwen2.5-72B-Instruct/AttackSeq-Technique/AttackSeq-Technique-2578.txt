### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Obfuscation of a VBA-Macro with thematically chosen variable names.
     - Dropping a file from a specified URL.
     - Establishing communication with the URL's domain to execute 'nanagrams.exe'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBA) for execution, which aligns with the obfuscation of the VBA-Macro mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a remote system. This aligns with the step of establishing communication with the URL's domain to execute 'nanagrams.exe'.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into performing actions, such as clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment. While phishing could be the initial vector for delivering the VBA-Macro, it does not directly align with the step of establishing communication with the URL's domain.
   - **C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails. This does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **D: T1650-Acquire Access**
     - This technique involves gaining access to a system, which is a broader category and does not specifically align with the step of establishing communication with the URL's domain.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of an application layer protocol to establish communication with the URL's domain to execute 'nanagrams.exe'.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
