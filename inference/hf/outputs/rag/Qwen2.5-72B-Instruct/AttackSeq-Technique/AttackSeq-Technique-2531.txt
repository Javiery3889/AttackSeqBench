### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the LURK malware connecting to a command-and-control (C2) server and using a backup domain for communication.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial access via socially engineered emails.
     - Connection to a C2 server.
     - Use of a backup domain for communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique involves using a service (e.g., social media, email) to send spearphishing messages.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending a link in a spearphishing message to entice the victim to click and trigger the malware.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using backup communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1561-Disk Wipe**
     - Disk wiping is a destructive action that typically occurs after an attacker has achieved their objectives, not before gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection**
     - Content injection involves modifying or adding content to a website or application, which is not directly related to gaining initial access via phishing.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon, which is typically done after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing, specifically spearphishing via service (T1566.003) or spearphishing link (T1566.002), is a common method for gaining initial access to a target system. This aligns with the question's mention of socially engineered emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves gaining initial access via phishing.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
