### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before GreyEnergy used PsExec or WinExe for lateral movement.
   - The initial access was gained through compromised public-facing web services or spearphishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using legitimate remote services such as RDP, SSH, or VNC to access a system. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not typically a prerequisite for using PsExec or WinExe.
   - **B: T1557.004-Evil Twin:** This technique involves creating a rogue wireless access point to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not typically used in the context of gaining initial access through public-facing web services or spearphishing.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. It is a common prerequisite for using tools like PsExec or WinExe for lateral movement, as these tools often require valid credentials to execute commands on remote systems.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This is the same as choice C.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial access was gained through compromised public-facing web services or spearphishing emails, the next logical step before using PsExec or WinExe for lateral movement would be to obtain valid credentials.
   - Valid accounts (T1078) are necessary to authenticate and execute commands on remote systems using tools like PsExec or WinExe.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts
