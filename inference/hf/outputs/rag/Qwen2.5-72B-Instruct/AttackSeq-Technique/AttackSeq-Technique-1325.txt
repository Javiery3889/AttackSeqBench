### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke has conducted discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives, including non-English filenames.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to gather information from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which is part of the Discovery tactic. This technique involves adversaries searching for specific files and directories on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code at a specified time. It is typically used for persistence or execution, not for gathering information immediately after discovery.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which is a method of gathering information but is not typically the next logical step after file and directory discovery.
   - **C: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating kernel modules and extensions, which is more related to persistence and privilege escalation, not information gathering.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is a method of gathering information. After discovering specific files and directories, an attacker might want to capture the screen to gather more context or additional information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after file and directory discovery would be to gather more information from the victim's system, which aligns with screen capture.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
