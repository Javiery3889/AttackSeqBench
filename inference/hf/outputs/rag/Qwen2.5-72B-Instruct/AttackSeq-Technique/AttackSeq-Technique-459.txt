### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where CEIDPageLock uses a dropped driver to evade detection by endpoint security products. After evading detection, the driver connects to one of two hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1547.008-LSASS Driver (Persistence):** This technique involves loading a driver into the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to maintain persistence.
   - **T1036-Masquerading (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1216.002-SyncAppvPublishingServer**
     - This technique involves using a legitimate application virtualization service to deploy and execute malicious code. It does not fit the context of connecting to a C&C server to download a configuration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature**
     - This technique involves using an invalid or untrusted code signature to masquerade malicious code. While it could be part of the evasion process, it does not directly relate to the C&C communication described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server. This fits the context of the driver connecting to a C&C domain to download a configuration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not relevant to the C&C communication described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique aligns with the driver connecting to a C&C domain to download the homepage configuration.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
