### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Tropic Trooper, including the use of DLL hijacking to load a malicious DLL (wab32res.dll) via sidebar.exe, the creation of a hidden directory, and the injection of the backdoor DLL into the legitimate process dllhost.exe for Defense Evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoor DLL was injected into dllhost.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location that is searched before the legitimate DLL, causing the system to load the malicious DLL instead.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate application by placing the malicious DLL in the same directory as the legitimate application.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a running process to execute code in the context of that process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of loading and injecting the DLL.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. This is not relevant to the DLL hijacking and injection sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which aligns with the described action of injecting the backdoor DLL into dllhost.exe.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute code. While this could be used to facilitate the attack, it is not the most direct technique for the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack described is that the backdoor DLL was injected into the legitimate process dllhost.exe using **T1055-Process Injection**.

**Final Answer: C: T1055-Process Injection**
