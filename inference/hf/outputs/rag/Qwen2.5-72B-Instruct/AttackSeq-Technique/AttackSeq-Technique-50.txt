### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before a PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers and used methods like `DownloadString` and `DownloadData` to request and download payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This indicates that the PowerShell script is being used to execute commands.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary transferring tools or other files from a remote system to the victim network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it can be used in C2 communications, it is not typically a prerequisite for downloading payloads.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used to gain initial access, it is not directly related to the downloading of payloads.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files from a remote system to the victim network. This aligns well with the scenario where a PowerShell script is used to download payloads from C2 servers.
   - **D: T1027.003-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. While it can be used to obfuscate C2 communications, it is not typically a prerequisite for downloading payloads.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerShell script first used **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** to download the payloads from the C2 servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
