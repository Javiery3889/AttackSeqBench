### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Octopus malware uses the FormCreate() function to achieve persistence by copying a network module to the startup directory as Java.exe.
   - The key points are:
     - **Persistence**: The malware is trying to ensure it runs automatically when the system starts.
     - **Startup Directory**: The malware copies a file to the startup directory to achieve this.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. It is not related to achieving persistence or copying files to the startup directory.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
     - Pass the Ticket is a technique used to authenticate to a service or system using a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or service ticket. It is not related to achieving persistence or copying files to the startup directory.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves various methods to achieve persistence by ensuring that a program runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns with the described behavior of copying a file to the startup directory.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
     - This technique is specific to Linux and involves creating autostart entries in the XDG (Cross-Desktop Group) configuration. It is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
