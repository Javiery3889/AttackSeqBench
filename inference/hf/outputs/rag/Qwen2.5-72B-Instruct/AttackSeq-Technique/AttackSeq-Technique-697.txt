### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the discovery phase after the cybercriminals downloaded remote administration tools during the execution phase.
   - The focus is on the discovery phase, where the attackers are exploring the financial systems of the targeted organization.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or commands.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying installed software and applications on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1201-Password Policy Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the password policies of the target organization. While this can be useful, it is not the primary focus of exploring financial systems.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves concealing the presence of malicious activities. This is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase rather than the discovery phase.
   - **C: T1027.008-Stripped Payloads:** This technique involves removing metadata or other identifying information from a payload. This is more relevant to the initial stages of an attack rather than the discovery phase.
   - **D: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves identifying user and service accounts on the system. This is highly relevant to the discovery phase, especially when exploring financial systems, as understanding the accounts can provide access to sensitive information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the attackers discovering accounts on the system to gain access to financial systems.

**Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery**
