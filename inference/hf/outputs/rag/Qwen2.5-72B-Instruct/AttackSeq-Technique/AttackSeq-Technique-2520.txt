### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where BlueDelta exploited Roundcube vulnerabilities to perform discovery activities on system and network information.
   - After this, the attackers secured sensitive victim credentials, specifically the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique is part of the Credential Access tactic and involves dumping credentials from the operating system. However, the specific sub-technique T1003.008 is mentioned in the related TTPs, which is directly related to the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files. This technique would occur after the discovery activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique is part of the Discovery tactic and involves discovering the network configuration of the system. This fits well with the initial discovery activities described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.014-Active Setup**: This technique is part of the Persistence tactic and involves setting up persistence mechanisms. This does not fit the context of the discovery and credential dumping sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1187-Forced Authentication**: This technique is part of the Credential Access tactic and involves forcing authentication to gain access to a system. This does not fit the context of the discovery and credential dumping sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers performed system network configuration discovery (T1016) after exploiting the Roundcube vulnerabilities and before securing the sensitive victim credentials.

**Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
