### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by the OceanLotus Group to expand within the network after harvesting credentials and before using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - The key points are:
     - Harvesting credentials from compromised machines.
     - Utilizing Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks for further network infection.
     - The technique in question should facilitate the expansion within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
     - This technique involves poisoning the LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) to capture and relay authentication requests, which can be used to harvest credentials.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials (hashes) to authenticate and move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:**
     - This technique is also listed under Defense Evasion, indicating that it can be used to evade detection while moving laterally.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1546.008-Accessibility Features:**
     - This technique involves modifying accessibility features to maintain persistence. It does not directly facilitate network expansion or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to evade detection. It does not directly facilitate network expansion or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials (such as hashes) to authenticate and move laterally within the network. This aligns well with the context of the question, as it is a key step in expanding within the network after harvesting credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions to gain unauthorized access. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not as directly relevant to the context of using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is facilitated by **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**. This technique is crucial for using stolen credentials to move laterally within the network, which is a key step in the attack sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
