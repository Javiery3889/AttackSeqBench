### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Regin, specifically what technique likely occurred after it gathered information on processes and memory utilization and monitored network traffic for IIS web servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery (Discovery):** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery (Discovery):** This technique involves gathering information about running processes on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy (Command and Control):** This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with the command and control server. While this is a common technique, it is typically used for maintaining communication rather than immediately after gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1112-Modify Registry (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves modifying the registry to change system behavior or hide malicious activities. This could be used to evade detection, but it is not directly related to the sequence of gathering system information and monitoring network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture (Collection):** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or credentials. This is a collection technique and could be used after gathering system information, but it is not the most likely next step in the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery (Discovery):** This technique involves discovering network connections and open ports on the system. This is a logical next step after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and monitoring network traffic, as it helps the attacker understand the network environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible next step after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and monitoring network traffic for IIS web servers is to discover system network connections.

**Final Answer: D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
