### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after a malicious Word document with a macro was executed, leading to the creation and running of "vba_macro.exe".

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into opening a malicious file, such as a Word document, which can then execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBA) to execute code, which is often used in macros within Office documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the deletion of data, which is not typically the immediate next step after a macro execution. It is more likely to occur later in the attack lifecycle.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**: This technique involves using the command-line interface of network devices, which is not relevant to the execution of a macro in a Word document.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**: This technique involves accessing cloud instance metadata, which is not related to the execution of a macro in a Word document.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into executing a file, which aligns with the initial step of the user opening the malicious Word document. However, the question asks about what happens after the macro is executed, not the initial user action.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context, the most plausible sequence is that after the user opens the malicious Word document and the macro is executed, the next step is the execution of the "vba_macro.exe" file. This aligns with the use of Visual Basic (VBA) to execute code, which is described by T1059.005.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
