### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Gamaredon discovered interesting files (Office documents) on a system for future exfiltration.
   - The next step in the sequence is that their malware scanned all drives and removable media for sensitive files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a broader collection activity. However, it does not specifically fit the context of discovering files for future exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT:** This technique involves using scripting languages to execute commands. It does not fit the context of discovering files or preparing for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing data using a custom method, which is typically done after data has been collected and before exfiltration. It does not fit the context of the discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. It is a low-level technique that could be used for various purposes, including file discovery, but it is not as specific as T1083.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after discovering interesting files, the malware would need to identify and locate other files and directories on the system before scanning all drives and removable media.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** fits this context perfectly, as it involves identifying file and directory paths, which is a necessary step before scanning all drives and removable media.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
