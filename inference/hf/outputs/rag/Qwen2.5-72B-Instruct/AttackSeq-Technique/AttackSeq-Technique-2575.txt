### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated the adversary's entry into the target system before the obfuscated JavaScript payload executed by the VBA-Macro functions started communicating with an external IP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves the use of Visual Basic (VBA) for execution, which is consistent with the VBA-Macro functions mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a common initial access technique where adversaries trick users into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links. This can lead to the execution of VBA macros in documents.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a trusted third-party to gain access to the target system. While possible, it is less likely in the context of a VBA macro execution.
   - **C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to execute malicious code. It is more relevant to post-exploitation activities rather than initial access.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it is relevant to the obfuscated JavaScript payload, it does not facilitate the initial entry into the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary used phishing to gain initial access, which then led to the execution of the VBA macro and the obfuscated JavaScript payload.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
