### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where T9000 malware has collected sensitive data and needs to communicate with its C2 server using encrypted traffic while navigating through environments with web proxies.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy:** This sub-technique involves the use of an external proxy server to route traffic, which can help in bypassing network restrictions or evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique is directly related to the use of proxies to route traffic, which is mentioned in the question as a way to navigate through environments with web proxies.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1555.001-Keychain**
     - This technique involves the theft of credentials from keychain storage, which is not relevant to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves the automated collection of data, which is not directly related to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1001.001-Junk Data**
     - This technique involves the addition of junk data to obfuscate the true content of the data, which is not directly related to the communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **T1090-Proxy**. This technique aligns with the need to communicate with a C2 server using encrypted traffic while navigating through environments with web proxies.

**Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy**
