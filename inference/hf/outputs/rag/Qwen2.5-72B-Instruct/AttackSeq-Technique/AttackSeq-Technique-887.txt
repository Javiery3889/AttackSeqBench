### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses malicious URLs to harvest email credentials or deliver exploit documents for initial access.
   - The focus is on the delivery of GAMEFISH malware onto targeted machines.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves scheduling tasks using cron jobs, which is more related to persistence and execution rather than initial access or exploitation.
   - **B: T1588.003-Code Signing Certificates:** This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malware, which is more related to defense evasion and not directly to initial access or exploitation.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access, which is more related to initial access but not specifically to spearphishing or malicious URLs.
   - **D: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting client-side applications (e.g., web browsers, email clients) to execute malicious code, which aligns well with the use of malicious URLs and spearphishing links to deliver exploit documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**. This technique directly aligns with the use of malicious URLs and spearphishing links to deliver exploit documents and gain initial access to the target system.

**Final Answer: D: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
