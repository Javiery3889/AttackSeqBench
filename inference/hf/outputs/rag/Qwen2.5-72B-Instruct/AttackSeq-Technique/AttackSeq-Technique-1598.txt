### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FastPOS has already infiltrated the system through methods like links to a compromised site or direct file transfer via VNC.
   - The focus is on the technique that likely occurred before the RAM scraper transmitted stolen credit card information to the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include sensitive information like credit card data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While this could be a method of initial access, it is not relevant to the immediate transmission of stolen credit card information.
   - **B: T1552.007-Container API:** This technique involves accessing sensitive information from container APIs. It is not directly related to the collection or transmission of credit card data.
   - **C: T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. While it can be used to collect credit card data, it is not the most likely technique in the context of a RAM scraper.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which can include keystrokes, clipboard data, and other forms of input. This is a broader category that includes keylogging and other methods of capturing user input.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique in the context of a RAM scraper is **T1056-Input Capture**. A RAM scraper typically captures data directly from memory, which can include user input and other sensitive information. This technique aligns with the immediate transmission of stolen credit card information to the attacker.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
