### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities are used for initial access.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the use of wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation practices to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable by the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**
     - This technique involves modifying cloud compute configurations, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence involving back door Trojans, zero-day vulnerabilities, and de-obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence involving back door Trojans, zero-day vulnerabilities, and de-obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data, which is not directly related to the described attack sequence involving back door Trojans, zero-day vulnerabilities, and de-obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection, which aligns well with the described attack sequence. The use of wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation practices to avoid detection is a form of obfuscation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**.

**Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
