### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during Longhorn's external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection after setting up communication with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for C&C communication.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**
     - This technique involves storing data in memory or other non-persistent locations to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to external communication or maintaining operational security during C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This technique involves scheduling data exfiltration or C&C communication at specific times to avoid detection. While it can help in maintaining operational security, it does not directly address the use of a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This is a duplicate of Answer Choice B and can be disregarded.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of C&C communications. Given that the question mentions a custom cryptographic protocol, this technique is the most relevant as it directly addresses the use of encryption to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of an encrypted channel to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
