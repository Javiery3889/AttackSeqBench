### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor BRONZE PRESIDENT to minimize detection. Specifically, the actions include deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of an attack.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:** This technique involves actions to prevent or hinder system recovery, such as deleting volume shadow copies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing:** This technique involves modifying or spoofing process arguments to hide malicious activity. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not directly align with the described actions of deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the described actions of minimizing detection by deleting files and terminating processes.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information. It is not related to the described actions of minimizing detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. The sub-technique T1070.004-File Deletion is specifically mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the described actions of deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is T1070-Indicator Removal, specifically T1070.004-File Deletion.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
