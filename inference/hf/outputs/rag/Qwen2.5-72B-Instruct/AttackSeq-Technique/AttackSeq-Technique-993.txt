### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was achieved through a phishing email, a VBS script was used to drop a JavaScript backdoor, and then an obfuscated script was executed to load a DLL file in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable by the malware.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves the execution of JavaScript code to perform various malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. It does not fit the context of deobfuscating and loading a DLL in memory.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**
     - This technique involves hiding email rules to maintain persistence or evade detection. It does not fit the context of deobfuscating and loading a DLL in memory.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules (like DLLs) to execute code. While it is related to loading a DLL, it does not specifically address the deobfuscation and execution of the script.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. It is not directly related to deobfuscating and loading a DLL in memory.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** because it directly involves loading a malicious DLL in memory, which aligns with the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules

However, upon re-evaluation, the most precise and contextually appropriate answer is:

Final Answer: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading

This technique is the most accurate representation of the described attack sequence, where a DLL file is loaded in memory after the execution of an obfuscated script.
