### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the Lazarus Group used tools like `SMBMap` and system commands (`net user`, `tasklist.exe`) for discovery within the network.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique enabled the group to move laterally by leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to access and control remote systems.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the owner and user of a system, which is useful for further exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management:** This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote access. While it is a valid lateral movement technique, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials or tokens to authenticate. This aligns with the use of compromised privileged accounts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1098-Account Manipulation:** This technique involves modifying or creating accounts to maintain access. While it is related to privilege escalation, it is not directly about lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1137.001-Office Template Macros:** This technique involves using macros in Office templates to execute code. It is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using compromised privileged accounts to move laterally, which aligns with the technique **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**.

**Final Answer: B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
