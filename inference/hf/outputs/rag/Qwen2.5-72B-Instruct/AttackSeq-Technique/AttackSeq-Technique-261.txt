### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Hellsing APT group achieved Command and Control by connecting their backdoor to a command server at philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com.
   - The focus is on the technique that granted them Initial Access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering the internet connection status of the victim's system. This is useful for understanding the network environment but does not directly grant initial access.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves the adversary transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment. This is typically used after initial access has been gained to set up further command and control infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique is used after initial access has been gained to transfer tools or files. It does not grant initial access.
   - **B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking the dynamic linker to execute malicious code. While it can be used to maintain persistence or execute code, it is not typically used for initial access.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to trick victims into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. Phishing is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This is the same as choice C.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that would have occurred before the Hellsing APT group achieved Command and Control is **T1566-Phishing**. Phishing is a common method for gaining initial access to a system, which would then allow the group to set up their backdoor and connect to the command server.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
