### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the BlackEnergy 3 malware gained initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
   - The initial access was achieved through exploitation, which is a common method for gaining entry into a system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Microsoft Office) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job:** This technique involves scheduling a task or job in a container orchestration system, which is not typically a next step after gaining initial access through exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves concealing the attacker's infrastructure, which is a post-compromise technique but not immediately following initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file, which is often used in conjunction with spearphishing. Given that the initial access was through exploitation, this is a plausible next step if the user needs to execute the payload.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique involves evading debuggers, which is a post-compromise technique to avoid detection but not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through exploitation, the next step would be to ensure the user executes the payload. This aligns with the T1204-User Execution technique, which is often used in conjunction with spearphishing to ensure the user opens the malicious attachment.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution
