### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group has gained access to other devices within the FEIB network using hardcoded credentials and established connections to SMB shares.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after this initial access and connection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**
   - **Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to access and control remote systems, which aligns with the scenario of establishing connections to SMB shares.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate further actions. This could be a plausible next step after gaining access and establishing connections.
   - **B: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking an existing remote service session, which is less likely to be the immediate next step after establishing SMB connections.
   - **C: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
     - This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which is not directly related to the context of lateral movement and SMB connections.
   - **D: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication, which is not directly related to the immediate next step after establishing SMB connections.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the Lazarus group has already gained access and established connections to SMB shares, the most logical next step would be to transfer tools or files to the remote systems to facilitate further lateral movement or other malicious activities.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** aligns best with the described scenario and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
