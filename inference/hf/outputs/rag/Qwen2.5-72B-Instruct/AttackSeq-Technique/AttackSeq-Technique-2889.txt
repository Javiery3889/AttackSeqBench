### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts. The next step in the sequence is to establish communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Command and Control" and the technique is "T1071.001-Web Protocols."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route network traffic. While it can be used for command and control, it is not specifically about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves disrupting network availability. It is not related to establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. The sub-technique T1071.001-Web Protocols specifically mentions using HTTP and HTTPS, which aligns with the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly calling system APIs. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves using HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communication, which is T1071.001-Web Protocols.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
