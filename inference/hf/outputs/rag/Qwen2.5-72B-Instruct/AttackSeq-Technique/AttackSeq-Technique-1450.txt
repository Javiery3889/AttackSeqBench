### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where FoggyWeb configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic legitimate AD FS URIs and retrieves sensitive AD FS data.
   - The next step in the sequence is to exfiltrate this data back to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C2 server using the same channel that was used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using network traffic to signal or communicate with other systems. It is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium:** This technique involves physically removing data from a network, which is not relevant to the described scenario of exfiltration over a network.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate. While it could be used for exfiltration, it is not as specific as T1041.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control, which aligns perfectly with the described scenario.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that after FoggyWeb retrieves sensitive AD FS data, it exfiltrates this data back to the C2 server using the same channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
