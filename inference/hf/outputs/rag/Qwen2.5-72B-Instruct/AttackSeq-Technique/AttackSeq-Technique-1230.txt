### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where POWERSHOWER collected system information and transmitted it to the C2 server.
   - After this, it entered a communications loop by utilizing a proxy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic to the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automatically collecting data from the system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This is a broader technique that includes using a proxy to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic. While it is a form of proxy, it is more complex and not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy:** This is a general technique for using a proxy to communicate with the C2 server. It aligns with the related TTP T1090-Proxy.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input from the graphical user interface. It is not related to the communication loop or proxy usage.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access. It is not related to the communication loop or proxy usage.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **B: T1090-Proxy**. This technique aligns with the use of a proxy to communicate with the C2 server after collecting and transmitting system information.

Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy
