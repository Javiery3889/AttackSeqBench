### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where SideCopy used njRAT malware with specific victim IDs and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after the exfiltration of these databases.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using USB devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens or codes. It is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or credentials. It is not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves using automated methods to exfiltrate data. This is directly related to the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, which aligns with the exfiltration tactics.
   - The related TTPs (T1041 and T1052.001) both involve exfiltration, but the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred after the exfiltration.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the most plausible answer because it directly relates to the automated process of exfiltrating data, which is consistent with the use of njRAT malware and GoLang-based file recon plugins.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
