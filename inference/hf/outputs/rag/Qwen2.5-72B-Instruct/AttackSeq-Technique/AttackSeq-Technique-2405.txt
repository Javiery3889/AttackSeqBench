### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitates periodic communication with the C2 server to receive tasks and obtain a unique identifier after data collection and staging.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a schedule for data exfiltration, which aligns with periodic communication.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves using the C2 channel to exfiltrate data, which is relevant to communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information, which is not directly related to communication with the C2 server but is useful for obtaining a unique identifier.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a prerequisite but not the communication method.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication, which is a plausible method for periodic communication with the C2 server.
   - **C: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services, which is not directly related to periodic communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** (Answer Choice B) is the most plausible technique for facilitating periodic communication with the C2 server. It aligns with the need to use standard protocols for communication, which is a common method for C2 communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
