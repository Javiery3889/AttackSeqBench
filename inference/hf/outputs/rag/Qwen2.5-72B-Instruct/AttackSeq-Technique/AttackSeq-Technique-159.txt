### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have performed account discovery to identify local accounts on compromised systems. The next step in the attack sequence is to move laterally within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account:** This technique involves identifying local accounts on a system, which aligns with the initial step of account discovery.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts to gain initial access to a system, which is relevant but not the next step in the sequence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.005-VNC:** This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not the most common or direct method after discovering local accounts.
   - **B: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves using port knocking to open ports on a firewall. It is not typically used for lateral movement within a network.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials (such as those discovered during account discovery) to move laterally within the network. This is a common and logical next step after identifying local accounts.
   - **D: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading or disabling security controls. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it is not the most likely next step after account discovery for lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible answer is **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**. This technique directly follows the discovery of local accounts and is a common method for lateral movement within a network.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
