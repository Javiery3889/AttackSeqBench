### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Gholee malware avoided detection through mechanisms to hide from debuggers and employed obfuscation techniques.
   - The key points are:
     - Avoiding detection from debuggers (T1622-Debugger Evasion).
     - Employing obfuscation techniques (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique involves the malware checking for the presence of debuggers to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves the malware using various methods to obfuscate its code or data to make analysis more difficult.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**
     - This technique involves shutting down or rebooting the system, which is not directly related to avoiding detection or obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves the malware disguising itself as a legitimate file or process, which can help in avoiding detection but is not directly related to debugger evasion or obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
     - This technique involves the malware changing its code to avoid detection by signature-based defenses, which is a form of obfuscation. This aligns well with the obfuscation techniques mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the malware using standard application layer protocols to communicate, which is not directly related to avoiding detection or obfuscation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first employed polymorphic code (T1027.014-Polymorphic Code) to obfuscate its code, which would then be followed by debugger evasion (T1622-Debugger Evasion) and further obfuscation (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information).

**Final Answer: C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
