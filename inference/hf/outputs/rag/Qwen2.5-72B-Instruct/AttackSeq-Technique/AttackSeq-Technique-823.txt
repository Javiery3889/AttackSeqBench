### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FIN4:
     - Organized targeted individuals using campaign codes.
     - Transmitted this information to C2 servers along with stolen credentials.
     - Captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing within an organization to move laterally.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, such as VBA macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token:**
     - This technique involves stealing access tokens from applications, which is not directly related to capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which is a plausible method for capturing credentials but does not specifically mention spearphishing.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to capture emails, which is not directly related to capturing credentials through spearphishing.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to capturing credentials through spearphishing.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros is **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**. This technique specifically mentions using malicious attachments, which aligns with the use of VBA macros in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture

However, based on the context and the specific mention of VBA macros in the question, the most precise answer should be:

Final Answer: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

But since T1566.001 is not one of the provided answer choices, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
