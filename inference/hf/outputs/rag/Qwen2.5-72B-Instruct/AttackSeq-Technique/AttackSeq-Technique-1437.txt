### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before ProjectM actors developed a toolset including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs for their campaigns.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1588.002-Tool:** This technique involves acquiring or developing tools to support operations.
   - **T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring domains to support operations.
   - **T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves acquiring or developing malware to support operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities:**
     - This technique involves identifying and collecting information on vulnerabilities to be exploited. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs after the initial resource development phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure such as domains, servers, and other resources to support the attack. This is a foundational step in the resource development phase and often precedes the development of toolsets.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.009-Resource Forking:**
     - This technique involves using resource forking to hide data or code. This is more of an operational technique used during the execution phase rather than the resource development phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. This typically occurs after the resource development phase and the development of toolsets.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that ProjectM actors first acquired the necessary infrastructure (domains, servers, etc.) before developing their toolset. This aligns with the resource development phase and the related TTPs provided.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure
