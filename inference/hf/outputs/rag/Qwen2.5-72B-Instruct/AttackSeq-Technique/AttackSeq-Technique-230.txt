### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the installation of backdoors as services and before the backdoors connected to command and control servers to receive commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain command and control (C2) over a compromised system.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not directly related to the sequence of installing backdoors and connecting to C2 servers.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process, which could be used to maintain persistence or evade detection but is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications, which is a logical step to take after setting up the backdoor and before connecting to the C2 server to ensure the communication is secure.
   - **D: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:** This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate to services, which is more related to initial access or lateral movement rather than the communication with C2 servers.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the backdoors are installed, the attacker would set up an encrypted channel to ensure secure communication with the C2 server before actually connecting to it. This aligns with the related TTPs, particularly T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which suggests the use of multiple stages of communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
