### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where files are collected and staged in the %TEMP% directory as ".a" files.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before WinDealer communicated with C2 servers using encrypted channels.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. However, the question asks what happened before the communication with C2 servers, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
     - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. While it is a method of communication, it does not fit the context of data staging and preparation before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. Similar to B, it is a method of communication but does not fit the context of data staging and preparation.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**
     - This technique involves limiting the size of data transfers to avoid detection. This could be a plausible step before exfiltration, but it is not as directly related to the data staging and preparation described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the data is collected and staged locally (T1074.001-Local Data Staging), the next step would be to prepare the data for exfiltration, which could involve compressing or archiving the data (T1560-Archive Collected Data).
   - However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred before communication with C2 servers. The most logical step before exfiltration over a C2 channel would be to prepare the data for transfer, which is best represented by T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits
