### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after victims were redirected to compromised websites where scripts or HTML smuggling techniques were employed for malware delivery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary compromising a website and causing a victim's system to automatically execute malicious code when the victim visits the site.
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique involves using HTML to smuggle malicious content through a network, often bypassing security measures.
   - **T1608.004-Drive-by Target:** This technique involves targeting specific individuals or groups by compromising websites they are likely to visit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is a post-compromise activity and not directly related to the initial access or delivery of malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves sending fraudulent communications to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While it can be used for initial access, it is not the most likely technique to follow a drive-by compromise.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which is a post-compromise activity and not directly related to the initial access or delivery of malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending targeted emails with malicious links to specific individuals. While it can be used for initial access, it is not the most likely technique to follow a drive-by compromise.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is that after the victims were redirected to compromised websites (T1189-Drive-by Compromise), the malware was delivered using HTML smuggling techniques (T1027.006-HTML Smuggling).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: **B: T1566-Phishing**

But given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:

Final Answer: **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling** (which is not an answer choice, but the closest related technique is **B: T1566-Phishing**).

Given the options, the most appropriate answer is:

Final Answer: **B: T1566-Phishing**
