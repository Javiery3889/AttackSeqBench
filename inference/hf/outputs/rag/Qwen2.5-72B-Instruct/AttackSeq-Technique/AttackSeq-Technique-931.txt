### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     - The Explosive Trojan used keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
     - After gaining access, the attackers employed a Command and Control (C2) framework involving multi-tiered servers.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
   - These TTPs confirm that keylogging was used to collect administrator passwords, which aligns with the first part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. It is not typically used after gaining credentials and before setting up a C2 framework.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a plausible step after gaining credentials and before setting up a multi-tiered C2 framework.
   - **C: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**
     - This technique involves spoofing the parent process ID to evade detection. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not a typical step between gaining credentials and setting up a C2 framework.
   - **D: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to access and control systems. This is a plausible step after gaining credentials and before setting up a C2 framework, as it allows the attackers to move laterally and establish control over the network.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** and **D: T1021-Remote Services** are both plausible, but **D: T1021-Remote Services** is more likely to occur immediately after gaining credentials. This is because remote services are often used to establish initial control and move laterally within the network, which is a necessary step before setting up a more complex C2 framework.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1021-Remote Services
