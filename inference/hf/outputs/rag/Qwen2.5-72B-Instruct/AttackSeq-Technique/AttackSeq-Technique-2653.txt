### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Dridex uses heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to communicate data such as the computer name and botnet ID number with its true Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with C2 servers. Given that the question mentions encrypted POST requests, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1622-Debugger Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading debuggers, which is not directly related to communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data, which is related to data obfuscation but not specifically to the communication method.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:**
     - This technique involves determining the physical location of the target, which is not relevant to the communication with C2 servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique aligns with the use of encrypted POST requests to communicate with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
