### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred after an obfuscated VBS script executed using `wscript.exe` and ensured detection was evaded by deleting itself post-execution.
   - Key points:
     - The script executed using `wscript.exe`.
     - The script deleted itself after execution to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of an attack.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities:** This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with malicious content.
     - It does not align with the context of file deletion post-execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves compromising hybrid identity services.
     - It does not align with the context of file deletion post-execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**
     - This technique involves re-opening applications to maintain persistence.
     - It does not align with the context of file deletion post-execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection.
     - It aligns with the context of file deletion post-execution, as deleting the script file is a way to hide artifacts and evade detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
