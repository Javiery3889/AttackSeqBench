### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the exploitation of the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability to execute the 'OSEA54d.tmp' file in the Initial Access phase.
   - The key points are:
     - Exploitation of CVE-2018-0798.
     - Execution of 'OSEA54d.tmp' file.
     - Initial Access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves an adversary exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique involves an adversary exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher-level permissions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code at a later time. This is typically used for persistence or execution, but it is not directly related to the initial exploitation and execution of a file.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools:**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to introduce malicious code. This is not directly related to the initial exploitation and execution of a file.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. This is a plausible choice because it aligns with the exploitation of CVE-2018-0798, which is a vulnerability in a client application.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering and enumerating containers and resources. This is not directly related to the initial exploitation and execution of a file.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the exploitation of the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability to execute the 'OSEA54d.tmp' file in the Initial Access phase is followed by the exploitation of a public-facing application.

**Final Answer: C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
