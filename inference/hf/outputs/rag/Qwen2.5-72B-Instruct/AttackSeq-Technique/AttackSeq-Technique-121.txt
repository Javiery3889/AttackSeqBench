### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the threat actor, Agrius, used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled them to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Lateral Movement" and the technique is "T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol."
   - This suggests that the threat actor used RDP for lateral movement within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not relevant to remote exploitation or lateral movement.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications, which is not directly related to remote exploitation.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. This is a plausible choice because it aligns with the idea of remote exploitation.
   - **D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using SMB or Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, which is not the same as RDP.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for remote exploitation within the context of using RDP for lateral movement is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**. This technique covers the exploitation of vulnerabilities in remote services, which is consistent with the scenario described.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
