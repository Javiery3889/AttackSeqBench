### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where ShadowTech RAT is deployed via a malicious executable during Initial Access.
   - After deployment, the malware ensures persistence by adding a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL:** This technique involves modifying the `Winlogon` key to load a malicious DLL at logon.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a registry key or a file to the startup folder to ensure the malware runs at logon.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes various methods to achieve persistence at boot or logon, including the above techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring additional tools or malware to the victim's system. While this could be part of the initial access, it does not directly relate to ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers:** This technique is specific to Linux systems and involves scheduling tasks using systemd timers. It is not relevant to the Windows registry key mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broad category that includes adding registry keys to ensure persistence at logon. The specific technique mentioned in the question (adding a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`) falls under this category.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves adding malicious add-ins to applications like Office. It is not relevant to the registry key mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware ensures persistence by adding a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`, which falls under the broader category of T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
