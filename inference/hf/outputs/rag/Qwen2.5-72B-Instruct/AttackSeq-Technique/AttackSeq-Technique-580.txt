### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Exploiting a vulnerability in SharePoint to install the AntSword webshell.
     - Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - Assessing the content of the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:**
     - This technique involves using tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system. This is a logical next step after gaining access and dumping credentials, as the attackers would want to understand the file structure and identify valuable data.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into processes to evade detection or gain elevated privileges. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after assessing the content of the system.
   - **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account:**
     - This technique involves accessing cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the context of assessing the content of a compromised on-premises system.
   - **D: T1036.006-Space after Filename:**
     - This technique involves using a space after a filename to hide files or executables. This is a method of obfuscation and not directly related to assessing the content of the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining access and dumping credentials would be to discover files and directories to assess the content of the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
