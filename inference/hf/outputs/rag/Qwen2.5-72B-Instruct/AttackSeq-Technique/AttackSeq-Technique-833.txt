### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WinDealer:
     - Encoded its configuration files using XOR for defense evasion.
     - Discovered network configuration and SNS application details on the victim's PC.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
   - This indicates that the encoding of configuration files is part of the defense evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts. It is often used for initial access or to run additional tools.
     - **Relevance:** It could be used to execute the encoding process, but it is not a necessary step between encoding and discovery.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions that are typically done through higher-level tools or commands.
     - **Relevance:** It could be used to interact with the system to discover network configuration and SNS application details, but it is not a necessary step between encoding and discovery.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves renaming or masquerading files, directories, or services to make them appear legitimate.
     - **Relevance:** This could be used to hide the encoded configuration files or the discovery tools, making it a plausible step between encoding and discovery.
   - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for secure communication.
     - **Relevance:** This is not relevant to the encoding of configuration files or the discovery of network configuration and SNS application details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that occurred between encoding the configuration files and discovering network configuration and SNS application details is **T1036-Masquerading**. This technique helps in hiding the encoded files and tools used for discovery, aligning with the defense evasion tactic.

**Final Answer: C: T1036-Masquerading**
