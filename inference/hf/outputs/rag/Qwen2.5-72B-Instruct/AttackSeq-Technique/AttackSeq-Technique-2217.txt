### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where tools have been transferred and network tunnels have been established for lateral movement.
   - The next step is to ensure secure communication with compromised systems and mimic normal traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic through an intermediary server to obfuscate the origin of the traffic and make it appear more legitimate.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools and other files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel. While this is a valid technique, it is more about data exfiltration rather than ensuring secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1137.005-Outlook Rules:** This technique involves using Outlook rules to automatically forward emails to a remote server. This is more specific to email-based exfiltration and does not align with the need for secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms:** This technique involves using algorithms to generate a large number of domain names to use as C2 servers. While this can help in evading detection, it does not directly ensure secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using proxies to route traffic through an intermediary server. The specific sub-technique T1090.002-External Proxy is mentioned in the related TTPs, which aligns with the need to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the need to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic, the most plausible answer is **T1090-Proxy**.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
