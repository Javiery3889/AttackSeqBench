### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary used discovery commands (like PsLogList) to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log and before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves adversaries using commands to gather information from log files, which aligns with the use of PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves adversaries using automated methods to collect data from the system, which could be a step between log enumeration and data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs:** This technique involves adversaries clearing log files to cover their tracks, which could be a step after log enumeration but before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals, which does not fit the context of log enumeration and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a logical step after log enumeration and before exfiltration. It aligns well with the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1218.014-MMC:** This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute malicious code, which does not fit the context of log enumeration and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is the final step in the sequence described, not the step between log enumeration and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the adversary collected data from the local system (T1005) after using discovery commands to extract log contents and before exfiltrating the data.

**Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System**
