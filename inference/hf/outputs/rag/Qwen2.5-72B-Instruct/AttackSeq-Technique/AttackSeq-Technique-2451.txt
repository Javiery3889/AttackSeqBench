### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after DRAGONFISH performed system information collection, retrieved installed software, and proxy details as part of its reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1592.002-Software:** This technique involves collecting information about installed software on a system.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves discovering software installed on a system, which can include both legitimate and malicious software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly interacting with the operating system's API to perform actions. It is not typically a follow-up to reconnaissance activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting information about running processes on a system. This is a logical next step after collecting system information and software details, as it helps the attacker understand what processes are active and potentially vulnerable.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1069.002-Domain Groups**
     - This technique involves enumerating domain groups and their members. While this is a useful technique for further reconnaissance, it is more specific to network and domain-level information and less likely to follow immediately after system and software discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. This is more related to command and control (C2) activities and is not a direct follow-up to reconnaissance and discovery activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible next step after collecting system information and software details would be to discover running processes on the system.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
