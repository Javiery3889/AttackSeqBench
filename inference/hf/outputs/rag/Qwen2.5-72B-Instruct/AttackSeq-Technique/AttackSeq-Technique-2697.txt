### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Elfin ensures persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.
   - It also mentions that PowerShell commands are used to bypass logging on the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
   - Both TTPs refer to the same technique, T1053.005, which is "Scheduled Task."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for information about the target, which is not relevant to the persistence or execution of a scheduled task.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at boot or logon, which is a form of persistence but not specifically related to scheduled tasks.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to execute code at specific times, which aligns perfectly with the described scenario of creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which is not relevant to the described scenario of creating a scheduled task.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
