### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that the Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next during the Collection phase to support the group's objective.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which can be useful for collecting visual information but is not typically a direct follow-up to system information discovery.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which can be useful for collecting sensitive information like credentials. This is a plausible next step after discovering system information.
   - **C: T1564.002-Hidden Users:** This technique involves creating hidden users, which is more related to persistence and evasion rather than collection.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes, which is useful for understanding the system's current state but is more related to the Discovery phase rather than the Collection phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information, the next logical step in the Collection phase would be to capture user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information like credentials.
   - **T1056-Input Capture** aligns best with the objective of collecting data after the initial discovery phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
