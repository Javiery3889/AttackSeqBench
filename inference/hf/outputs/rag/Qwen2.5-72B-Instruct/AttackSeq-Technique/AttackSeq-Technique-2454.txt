### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with phishing emails leading to the download of a ZIP file containing a malicious executable.
   - The malicious executable, when run, extracts an HTA script to the %temp% directory and executes it using mshta.exe.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which is consistent with the initial phishing email and the download of the ZIP file.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.005-Mshta:** This technique involves using the mshta.exe utility to execute scripts, which aligns with the execution of the HTA script from the %temp% directory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job:** This technique involves scheduling a task using container orchestration tools, which is not relevant to the described scenario.
   - **B: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using system binaries to proxy execution of malicious code, which is partially relevant but not specific to the use of mshta.exe.
   - **C: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file, which is relevant to the initial phishing email and the download of the ZIP file.
   - **D: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code, which is not relevant to the described scenario.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The initial step of the attack involves the user being tricked into downloading and running a malicious file, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
   - The subsequent step involves the use of mshta.exe to execute the HTA script, which aligns with T1218.005-Mshta.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:

**Final Answer: B: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution**

However, to be more precise, the sequence involves both T1204.002-Malicious File and T1218.005-Mshta. Since the question specifically asks about the execution of the HTA script using mshta.exe, the most relevant answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution**
