### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the WinDealer malware:
     - Execution of the malware.
     - Configuration by reading a configuration file.
     - Loading a DLL module.
     - Discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the discovery of system and network information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique is used to gather information about the network configuration of the infected system.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route network traffic. It is not directly related to the initial configuration and loading of the malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to detect and avoid virtualized environments and sandboxes. While it could be relevant, it is not directly related to the initial configuration and loading of the malware.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves disguising malicious files and processes to appear legitimate. While it could be used to hide the malware, it is not directly related to the initial configuration and loading of the malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying installed software on the system. While it is a discovery technique, it is not the most likely to occur immediately before the discovery of system and network configuration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the initial configuration and loading of the malware is **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**. This technique is used to load a malicious DLL, which is a crucial step in the malware's execution and configuration process.
   - After the DLL is loaded, the malware would then proceed to discover information about the infected PC and network configuration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1036-Masquerading

However, upon re-evaluation, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the related TTPs and the question is:

Final Answer: **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant based on the given context. If we must choose from the provided options, the closest is C: T1036-Masquerading, but it is not the most accurate.)
