### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the SombRAT backdoor utilized protocol tunneling over DNS/HTTP for communication with C2 servers.
   - The tools mentioned (pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for proxying) suggest that the backdoor is using proxies to facilitate communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network defenses and maintain command and control (C2) communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy:**
     - This technique is directly related to the use of proxies, which is mentioned in the question (pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for proxying).
     - It is a logical step that would occur before protocol tunneling, as the proxy setup is necessary to route the traffic through the tunnel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system.
     - While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the setup of the proxy or the tunneling.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the compromised system.
     - This could be a preliminary step, but it is not directly related to the setup of the proxy or the tunneling.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information.
     - This is not directly related to the setup of the proxy or the tunneling.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the proxy setup (T1090-Proxy) occurred before the protocol tunneling (T1572-Protocol Tunneling).

**Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy**
