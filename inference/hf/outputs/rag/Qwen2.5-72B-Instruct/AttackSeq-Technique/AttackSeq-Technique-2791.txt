### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to transmit collected data (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) from an iOS device to the operators.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the malware collecting device information.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware, which is not directly relevant to transmitting data to operators.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) to communicate with a remote system. This is a plausible method for transmitting collected data.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect the confidentiality of data in transit. While this is a common method for secure communication, it is not the primary technique for transmitting data.
   - **C: T1557.004-Evil Twin:** This technique involves creating a fake wireless access point to intercept data. This is not relevant to transmitting data from an already infected device.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files. This is not relevant to the transmission of collected data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for transmitting collected data to the operators is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is commonly used by malware to send data back to a command and control server using standard protocols.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
