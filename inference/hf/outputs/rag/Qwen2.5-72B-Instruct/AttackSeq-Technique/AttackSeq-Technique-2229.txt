### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after deploying scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner for network discovery, we need to determine the next ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate Earth Lusca's movement within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Discovery" and the technique is "T1046-Network Service Discovery."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying network services and their versions, which is a logical next step after using a scanning tool like HUC Port Banner Scanner. This aligns well with the context of network discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**
     - This technique involves using ptrace system calls to manipulate processes, which is more related to process manipulation and not network discovery.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves tricking internal users to gain access or information, which is not directly related to network discovery or movement within the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access, which could be a subsequent step after discovering network services but is not the immediate next step in the discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after deploying scanning tools for network discovery, the next step would be to perform network service discovery.

**Final Answer: A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
