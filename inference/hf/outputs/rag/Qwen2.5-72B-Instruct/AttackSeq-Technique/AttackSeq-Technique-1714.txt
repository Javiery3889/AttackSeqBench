### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda used spearphished '.lnk' files to deliver payloads like Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX.
   - The focus is on the technique used to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can be a document, executable, or script.
   - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the download and execution of a malicious file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or modifying the appearance of files or processes to make them appear legitimate. While this can be used to hide malicious activity, it does not directly address the initial deception of users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070.006-Timestomp:** This technique involves modifying the timestamps of files to hide their creation or modification times. This is more about obfuscation and does not directly relate to the initial user deception.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1647-Plist File Modification:** This technique involves modifying property list (plist) files on macOS to change the behavior of applications. This is specific to macOS and does not directly relate to the initial user deception in a Windows environment.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. This aligns well with the scenario of using spearphished '.lnk' files to deceive users.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1566-Phishing**.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
