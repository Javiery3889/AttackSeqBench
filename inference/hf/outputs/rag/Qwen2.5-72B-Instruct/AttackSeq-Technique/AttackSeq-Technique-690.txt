### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack involving the Pierogi backdoor.
   - The backdoor achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.
   - After achieving persistence, it collected information about the infected machine, such as the computer name and antivirus details.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves creating or modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code when a user interacts with the shortcut.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a program to the registry run keys or startup folder to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1587.004-Exploits:** This technique involves using exploits to gain initial access or escalate privileges. It is not typically used between achieving persistence and collecting information.
   - **B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging:** This technique involves preventing the logging of command history, which is more relevant to post-exploitation activities to avoid detection.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves disabling or avoiding security tools and defenses. This could be relevant if the backdoor needed to ensure it could operate without being detected or blocked.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, which is typically used for initial access, not between achieving persistence and collecting information.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the context, the most plausible technique that would occur after achieving persistence and before collecting information is **T1562-Impair Defenses**. This is because the backdoor would likely want to ensure that it can operate without being detected or blocked by security tools before collecting sensitive information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses
