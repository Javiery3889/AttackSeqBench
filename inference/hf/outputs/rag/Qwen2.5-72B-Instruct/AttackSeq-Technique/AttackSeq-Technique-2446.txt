### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Elise malware:
     - **Obfuscation techniques for data exfiltration to the C2 server using base64-encoded cookie values.**
     - **Heavy anti-virtual-machine features.**
     - **Spoofing of queries to non-existing domains.**
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:**
     - This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques (like base64) to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:**
     - This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect or understand.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - This technique involves making files or information harder to discover or analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1218.014-MMC**
     - This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute arbitrary code. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070.004-File Deletion**
     - This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks. While it could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly follow the described sequence of obfuscation and anti-VM features.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the registry to gather information. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade virtualization and sandbox environments. This aligns well with the described "heavy anti-virtual-machine features."

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the described actions, is the use of virtualization/sandbox evasion techniques after the obfuscation and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
