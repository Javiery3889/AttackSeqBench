### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the malware gathers system information and sends it to a C&C server.
   - The communication is established using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the browser, which is relevant to the question as the beacon mimics a Firefox browser.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1136.003-Cloud Account:** This technique involves creating a cloud account, which is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server using a beacon.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port, which is not relevant to the described communication method.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to evade defenses, which is not relevant to the communication method.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server, which aligns with the described use of a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
