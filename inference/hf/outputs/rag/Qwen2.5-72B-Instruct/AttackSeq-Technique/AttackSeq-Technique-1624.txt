### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll` during data collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a schedule for data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel with the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence or execute commands. It does not directly relate to secure communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication. While it can be used for secure communication, it is not specifically about encryption.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect the confidentiality of data in transit. This is directly relevant to secure communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1218.014-MMC:** This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute malicious code. It does not relate to secure communication with C&C servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**. This technique ensures that the communication between the backdoor component and the C&C server is secure and protected from eavesdropping.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
