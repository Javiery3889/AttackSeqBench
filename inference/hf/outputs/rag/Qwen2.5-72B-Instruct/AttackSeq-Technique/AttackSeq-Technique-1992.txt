### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy established C2 communication with `updaterweb[.]com` by sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request.
   - The key points are:
     - SkinnyBoy established C2 communication.
     - The communication involved sending exfiltrated data.
     - The data was sent in a structured POST request.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
   - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature.
     - While data obfuscation can be used to make exfiltration less detectable, it is not a necessary step before establishing C2 communication. It can occur at various stages of the attack.
   - **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
     - This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
     - This is more related to network manipulation and not directly to the exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
     - This is a plausible technique that would be used to establish C2 communication, especially when sending data in a structured POST request.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying the system owner or primary user.
     - This is typically used earlier in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the target, not directly related to the exfiltration process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that occurred before SkinnyBoy established C2 communication with `updaterweb[.]com` by sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
