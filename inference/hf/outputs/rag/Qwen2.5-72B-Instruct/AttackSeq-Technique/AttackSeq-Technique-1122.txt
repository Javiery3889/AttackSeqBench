### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an APT group uses DLL side-loading for defense evasion. This involves loading malicious DLLs through renamed clean loaders.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the execution phase, allowing the APT group to execute malicious code via legitimate Windows executables.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, which is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic. This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process by placing it in a location where the process will load it.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204.002-Malicious File**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is not relevant to the execution of code via legitimate Windows executables.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves loading shared modules (DLLs) into a process. This is closely related to DLL side-loading, as it involves the use of DLLs to execute malicious code.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which is not directly related to the execution of code via legitimate Windows executables.
   - **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not relevant to the execution of code via legitimate Windows executables.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible answer is **B: T1129-Shared Modules**. This technique aligns with the use of DLL side-loading to execute malicious code via legitimate Windows executables.

**Final Answer: B: T1129-Shared Modules**
