### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to gain initial access to the victim system before the malware executed its backdoor by rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of the malware.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering files and directories on the victim system, which is typically a post-compromise activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution:** This technique involves executing commands indirectly, often through scripts or other mechanisms. While it can be used in the execution phase, it is not typically the initial access method.
   - **B: T1560.001-Archive via Utility:** This technique involves compressing data, which is not relevant to gaining initial access.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious content, which is a common method for gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain access, which is also a common method for initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible initial access method is **Phishing (T1566)**. Phishing is a common technique used to trick users into opening malicious files, which aligns with the T1204.002-Malicious File technique mentioned in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing
