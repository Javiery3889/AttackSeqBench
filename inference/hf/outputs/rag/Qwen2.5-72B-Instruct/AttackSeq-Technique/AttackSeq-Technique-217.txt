### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is achieved through a weaponized link that directs the user to a .wsc file.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attacker utilized redirections and fileless implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate files or directories to avoid detection.
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL, causing the system to load the malicious DLL instead.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This is a broader technique that includes various methods of making malicious files or processes appear legitimate to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**
     - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to gain control over a network. It is not directly related to the initial access or the evasion techniques described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to hinder investigation. While it is a defense evasion technique, it is not typically used immediately after initial access and before fileless implementations.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting languages to execute commands. It is a common technique used after initial access to perform further actions, but it does not directly relate to the evasion techniques described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code or perform actions. It can be used in fileless attacks to evade detection, which aligns with the described use of fileless implementations of legitimate tools.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker used a technique to masquerade or match legitimate names or locations to evade detection before utilizing fileless implementations of legitimate tools.
   - The most appropriate answer choice that aligns with this sequence is **T1036-Masquerading**.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most appropriate answer that aligns with the evasion techniques described is:

**Final Answer: D: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
