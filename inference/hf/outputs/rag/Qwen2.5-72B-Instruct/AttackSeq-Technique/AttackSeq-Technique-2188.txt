### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used HTTP-based communication with RC4 encryption for command and control (C2).
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves transferring data from the infected machines to the attacker's C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like RC4) to encrypt C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves hiding files or directories to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to data exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository, which is not the same as exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels for C2 communications, which is already mentioned in the question (RC4 encryption). It does not specifically address data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique directly aligns with the scenario described in the question. It involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications, which is the logical next step after establishing the C2 channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
