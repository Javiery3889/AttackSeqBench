### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where encoded blobs are used to evade detection through PowerShell command line scripts, which then download additional malware.
   - The file-stealer module of Dropping Elephant is collecting specific file types for exfiltration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the file-stealer module began its operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is used to make the content of files or information unreadable to defenders, which aligns with the use of encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment, which aligns with downloading additional malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While phishing can be an initial entry point, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **B: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. This is more related to credential theft and not directly to the sequence of downloading additional malware and exfiltrating files.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from various password stores. Similar to B, this is more related to credential theft and not directly to the sequence described.
   - **D: T1495-Firmware Corruption**: This technique involves corrupting firmware to maintain persistence or cause damage. This is not directly related to the sequence of downloading additional malware and exfiltrating files.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves using encoded blobs to evade detection, which aligns with T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.
   - After evading detection, the malware downloads additional tools, which aligns with T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
   - The file-stealer module then begins collecting specific file types for exfiltration.
   - The most likely technique that occurred before the file-stealer module began its operation is the transfer of the file-stealer module itself, which is covered by T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

### Final Answer: B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
