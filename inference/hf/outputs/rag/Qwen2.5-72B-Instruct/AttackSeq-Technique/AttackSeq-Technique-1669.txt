### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the SocGholish framework is used to initiate the attack via compromised legitimate websites.
   - The next step in the sequence is the deployment of the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a legitimate website to deliver malicious content to victims when they visit the site.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves the transfer of additional tools or payloads to the compromised system for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts:**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain initial access. However, the question already states that the attack is initiated via a drive-by compromise, so this is less likely.
   - **B: T1106-Native API:**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the system. While it could be used during the attack, it is not typically a step that occurs before deploying a payload.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. However, the question specifically mentions a drive-by compromise, not phishing.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking:**
     - This technique involves using resource forking to hide data or code. While it could be used to obfuscate the payload, it is not a typical step before deploying a payload in a drive-by compromise scenario.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the drive-by compromise (T1189), the attackers would transfer the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload to the compromised system (T1105).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API

However, upon re-evaluation, the most logical sequence based on the related TTPs and the question is:

Final Answer: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

This is because the drive-by compromise (T1189) would be followed by the transfer of the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload (T1105) to the compromised system.
