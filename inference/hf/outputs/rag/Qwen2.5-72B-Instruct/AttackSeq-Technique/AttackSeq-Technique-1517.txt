### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     - A malspam campaign leveraged an HTA file containing encoded commands to exploit CVE-2017-8579.
     - After this, ComboJack malware ensured persistence by setting a registry key.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying code signing policies to allow the execution of unsigned or malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves setting registry keys or startup folder entries to ensure that malware runs at system startup.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This is a broader category that includes T1547.001 and other methods to ensure malware runs at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. Given that the HTA file contained encoded commands, this is a plausible step between the initial exploitation and setting the registry key for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, processes, or other artifacts to evade detection. While it could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely step immediately after exploiting CVE-2017-8579 and before setting the registry key.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using symmetric encryption. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker used a command and scripting interpreter (T1059) to execute the encoded commands in the HTA file, which would then lead to setting the registry key for persistence.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
