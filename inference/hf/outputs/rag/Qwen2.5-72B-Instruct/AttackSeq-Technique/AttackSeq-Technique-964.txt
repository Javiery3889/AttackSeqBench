### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled the download and installation of malicious software (Trojan.JS.Nodster.A and Trojan.Win32.Novter.A) before the Command and Control (C&C) phase involving communications to various C&C server IPs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing (A):** This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. It is not directly related to the download and installation of malware.
   - **T1204-User Execution (B):** This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which could lead to the download and installation of malware. This is a plausible candidate.
   - **T1559.003-XPC Services (C):** This technique involves using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to execute commands. It is not directly related to the initial download and installation of malware.
   - **T1654-Log Enumeration (D):** This technique involves collecting and analyzing log files. It is not directly related to the download and installation of malware.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique that enabled the download and installation of the malicious software is **T1204-User Execution**. This technique aligns with the scenario where a user is tricked into executing a malicious file, which then downloads and installs additional malware.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1204-User Execution
