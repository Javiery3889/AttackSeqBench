### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that APT28 has escalated privileges using CVE-2014-4076.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves extracting passwords from logged-in users.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain higher-level privileges.
   - **T1078 - Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to perform actions within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573 - Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications. It is not directly related to extracting passwords from logged-in users.
   - **B: T1558.004 - AS-REP Roasting:** This technique involves attacking the Kerberos Authentication Service (AS) to obtain and crack AS-REP responses. While it is related to credential theft, it is more specific to Kerberos and not directly to extracting passwords from logged-in users.
   - **C: T1622 - Debugger Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by debuggers. It is not related to extracting passwords from logged-in users.
   - **D: T1003 - OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which can include passwords, hashes, and other authentication information. This is directly related to extracting passwords from logged-in users.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after privilege escalation, APT28 would use OS Credential Dumping to extract passwords from logged-in users.

**Final Answer: D: T1003 - OS Credential Dumping**
