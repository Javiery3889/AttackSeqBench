### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Smooth Operator malware collects system details, including OS version, hostname, and account-related data, and specifically mentions extracting domain and account name values from the 3CX file `config.json`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is relevant to the exfiltration part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information, which is relevant to the collection of system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools, which is not directly related to the collection of system details or the extraction of data from a configuration file.
   - **B: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of network traffic, which is not directly related to the collection of system details or the extraction of data from a configuration file.
   - **C: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data from a remote email server, which is not directly related to the collection of system details or the extraction of data from a configuration file.
   - **D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which is directly related to the extraction of domain and account name values from the `config.json` file.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the extraction of data from a configuration repository, which aligns with the technique T1602.

**Final Answer: D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
