### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Bisonal malware evades defenses by using an RC4 cipher to encrypt its C2 address strings and hardcoded values for the initial HTTP POST connection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or information, which aligns with the use of the RC4 cipher to encrypt C2 address strings.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to protect command and control (C2) communications, which aligns with the use of the RC4 cipher for the initial HTTP POST connection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. While this could be relevant, it does not specifically follow the encryption of C2 address strings.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. This is not relevant to the post-evasion phase described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH for remote access. This is not relevant to the post-evasion phase described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic. This is a plausible next step after encrypting the C2 address strings to further obfuscate the communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that after the malware evades defenses using encryption, it would use protocol tunneling to further obfuscate the C2 communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
