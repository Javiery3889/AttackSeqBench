### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Infamous Chisel malware:
     - Enumerating multiple directories.
     - Performing IP scanning for system discovery.
     - Scraping files containing sensitive data.
     - Deploying tcpdump to sniff network interfaces.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before these actions, specifically involving scraping files and deploying tcpdump.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique aligns with the deployment of tcpdump to sniff network interfaces.
     - However, it does not directly address the scraping of files containing sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system.
     - It is not directly related to scraping files or network sniffing.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
     - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to discover systems.
     - It is related to IP scanning but not to scraping files or network sniffing.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1555.001-Keychain**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from keychain storage.
     - It is not related to scraping files or network sniffing.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves the deployment of tcpdump for network sniffing, which aligns with T1040-Network Sniffing.
   - While T1083-File and Directory Discovery is also relevant for scraping files, the question specifically asks for the technique that involves both scraping files and deploying tcpdump.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1040-Network Sniffing
