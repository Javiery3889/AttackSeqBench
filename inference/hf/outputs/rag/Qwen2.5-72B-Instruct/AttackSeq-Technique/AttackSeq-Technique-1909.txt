### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by APT10 to compromise targets before deploying malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT.
   - The focus is on the initial access phase, specifically through spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique is related to stealing web session cookies, which is typically used for maintaining access or exfiltrating data, not for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique is related to exfiltrating data using alternative protocols, which is not relevant to the initial access phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is a broad category of phishing attacks, which includes various methods to trick victims into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
     - This technique is a specific type of phishing that involves using a service (like email or social media) to deliver a spear phishing message. However, it is not the most specific match for the described scenario.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique for the described scenario is **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**. This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, which aligns perfectly with the initial access method used by APT10 to compromise targets.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: **C: T1566-Phishing**

However, if we consider the most specific match, the answer would be:
Final Answer: **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** (if it were an option). Since it is not, the closest and most relevant answer is **C: T1566-Phishing**.
