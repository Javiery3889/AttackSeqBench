### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by threat actors:
     - Using the AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools.
     - Dumping credentials using Mimikatz.
     - Using the Impacket tool `atexec` to run commands on other systems in the network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after using `atexec`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**
   - **Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
     - This technique involves dumping credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which is consistent with using Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying active user accounts and their roles. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence described after using `atexec`.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using Server Message Block (SMB) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within the network. This is a plausible next step after using `atexec` to run commands on other systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence described after using `atexec`.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1137-Office Application Startup**
     - This technique involves using Office applications to execute code at startup. This is not relevant to the sequence described after using `atexec`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after using `atexec` to run commands on other systems in the network is to use SMB/Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
