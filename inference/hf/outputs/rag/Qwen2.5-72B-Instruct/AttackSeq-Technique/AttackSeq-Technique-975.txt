### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the BE2 group executed malicious plugins for data destruction and backup communication over HTTPS.
   - The next step in the sequence is to identify the technique used to collect detailed information on the host system, including BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Discovery" and the technique is "T1082-System Information Discovery."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not relevant to collecting detailed information about the host system.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting detailed information about the host system, including BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS, which aligns perfectly with the question.
   - **T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft:** This technique involves stealing or impersonating tokens, which is not related to collecting detailed system information.
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data, which has already been mentioned in the question as part of the initial actions (executing 'dstr.dll').

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves collecting detailed information about the host system.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
