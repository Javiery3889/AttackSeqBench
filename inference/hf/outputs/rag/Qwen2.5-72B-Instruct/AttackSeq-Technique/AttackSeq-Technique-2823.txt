### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Hacking Team's spyware gained initial access by disguising an executable file as a PDF document and delivered via a spearphishing email.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after the initial access was gained.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access tactic was achieved using the technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment (in this case, a disguised executable file).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - This technique involves making a file or program appear legitimate or benign to avoid detection. This could be relevant if the spyware continued to masquerade after gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This is the initial technique used to gain access, not what happens after access is gained.
   - **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to execute it. This could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access to ensure the spyware runs undetected.
   - **D: T1647-Plist File Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying plist files on macOS to persist or change system behavior. This is less likely to be the immediate next step after gaining initial access, especially in a cross-platform context.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the initial access was gained through a spearphishing email with a disguised executable, the next logical step would be to ensure the spyware runs undetected. Process hollowing (T1055.012) is a common technique used to achieve this by injecting the malicious code into a legitimate process.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
