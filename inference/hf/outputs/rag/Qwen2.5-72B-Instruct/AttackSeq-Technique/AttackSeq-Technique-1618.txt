### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a first-stage dropper (`runrun.exe`) downloads and executes a second stage component to contact the C&C server.
   - After this, tools like a password dumper, privilege escalation tool, and proxy tool are deployed.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the deployment of these tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `rundll32.exe` utility to load and execute arbitrary code, often to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control communications. While it is important for maintaining stealth, it is not directly related to the transfer of tools.
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to execute arbitrary code. It is more related to persistence and execution rather than the transfer of tools.
   - **T1059.004-Unix Shell:** This technique involves using Unix shell commands to execute arbitrary code. It is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.
   - **T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL:** This technique involves using the `netsh` command to load a helper DLL, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used for persistence and execution, it is not directly related to the transfer of tools.

   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique is the most relevant to the question. It describes the process of transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment, which is exactly what happens before the deployment of tools like a password dumper, privilege escalation tool, and proxy tool.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the transfer of tools before their deployment.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
