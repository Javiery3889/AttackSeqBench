### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Remote Access Tool (RAT) is used to gather system and network information and encrypt Command and Control (C2) traffic in an HTTP request.
   - The Comfoo C2 server is acting as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to manipulate or influence the behavior of a system. It does not fit the scenario of a C2 server acting as a relay.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. Given that the Comfoo C2 server is acting as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console, this technique fits the scenario perfectly.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for C2 communication to avoid detection. While it could be relevant in some scenarios, it does not specifically describe the relay function of the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or screen captures. It does not fit the scenario of a C2 server acting as a relay.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy**.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
