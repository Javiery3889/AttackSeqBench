### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial step where `CertUtil.exe` is executed, disguised as `GoogleUpdate.exe` to evade detection.
   - The next step involves maintaining persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system or application files to avoid detection.
   - **T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying tasks or services to appear legitimate to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it can be used for evasion, it does not directly relate to maintaining persistence through repeated executions.
   - **B: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves placing a web shell on a web server to maintain access. It is more about maintaining access to a web server rather than repeated execution of a payload.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at specific times or intervals. This aligns well with maintaining persistence through repeated executions.
   - **D: T1583.007-Serverless:** This technique involves using serverless architectures to execute code. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence through repeated executions of a payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of maintaining persistence through repeated executions, the most plausible answer is **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.

### Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
