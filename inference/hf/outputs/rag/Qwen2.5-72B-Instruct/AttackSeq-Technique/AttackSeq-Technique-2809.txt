### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Grandoreiro establishes persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Grandoreiro hooked APIs and registered a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to elevate privileges.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification:** This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code when the shortcut is opened.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a program to the Windows Registry or startup folder to ensure it runs at system startup.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (Persistence):** This is the same as the previous technique but specifically for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging:** This technique involves creating a malicious process that appears to be a legitimate process. While this can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms that control elevation to gain higher privileges. This is a plausible candidate because it aligns with the goal of elevating privileges.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves discovering software on the system, which is not directly related to the sequence of establishing persistence and elevating privileges.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL:** This technique involves using the `netsh` command to register a helper DLL, which can be used for persistence and privilege escalation. However, it is not as directly related to the sequence described as T1548.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred before Grandoreiro hooked APIs and registered a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to elevate privileges is **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**.

Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
