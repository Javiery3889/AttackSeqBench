### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the BlueDelta group:
     - Exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube.
     - Performed discovery activities to gather system and network data.
     - Collected emails by implementing filters in the managesieve plugin for automatic forwarding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1114.001 - Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting emails from local email clients or servers.
   - **T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up rules to automatically forward emails to an attacker-controlled account.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information:**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as usernames, passwords, and personal details. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described, which focuses on system and network data and email collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow:**
     - This technique involves altering the execution flow of a program to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described, which focuses on discovery and email collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the victim's system. While it could be used in the context of the attack, it is not the most specific technique that fits the sequence of actions described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1596.001 - DNS/Passive DNS:**
     - This technique involves using DNS or passive DNS to gather information about the victim's network. It is more closely related to the discovery activities mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - **Discovery activities (T1596.001 - DNS/Passive DNS)**
     - **Email collection (T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule)**
   - The discovery activities (T1596.001) would likely occur after the initial exploitation and before the email collection to gather necessary information to set up the email forwarding rules.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS
