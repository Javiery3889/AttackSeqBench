### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Iron group:
     - Deployed a backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
     - The installer checked for VM execution.
     - Dropped a backdoor DLL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to gain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:**
     - This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:**
     - This technique is listed again, emphasizing its importance in the context.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. While it can be used for persistence, it does not directly align with the described sequence of dropping a backdoor DLL.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying a container, which is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves manipulating system services, which could be used for persistence but is not directly related to the described sequence of dropping a backdoor DLL.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection, which aligns well with the context of dropping a backdoor DLL and ensuring it remains undetected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique is crucial for ensuring that the backdoor DLL remains hidden and undetected, which is a common follow-up action after deploying a backdoor.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
