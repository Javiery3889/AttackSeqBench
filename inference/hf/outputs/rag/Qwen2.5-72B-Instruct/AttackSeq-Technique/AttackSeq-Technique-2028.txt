### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Duke group using Seaduke malware.
   - The actions include retrieving detailed bot/system information and securely deleting the malware from the system using a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1070.004-File Deletion, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the malware and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1218.013-Mavinject**
     - Mavinject is a technique used to load and execute arbitrary code by injecting it into a legitimate process. This does not align with the described action of securely deleting the malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - Protocol Tunneling involves encapsulating one protocol within another to evade detection. This is not related to the deletion of files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - Data Obfuscation involves altering data to make it less understandable. While this can be used to evade detection, it does not directly relate to the deletion of files.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information. This is not related to the deletion of files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is T1070.004-File Deletion, as it directly aligns with the self-delete function 'seppuku' used to securely delete the malware from the system.

**Final Answer: C: T1070.004-File Deletion**
