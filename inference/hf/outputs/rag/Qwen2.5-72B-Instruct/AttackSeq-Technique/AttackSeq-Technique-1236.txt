### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before WinDealer began execution by locating and decoding an embedded DLL file within its resources.
   - This implies that the technique in question is related to the preparation or setup phase before the actual execution of the DLL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Persistence and Defense Evasion):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, often by manipulating the search order or by placing the malicious DLL in a specific directory.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Defense Evasion):** This technique involves the process of decoding or deobfuscating data to reveal the actual content, such as a DLL or other executable code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using legitimate remote services to gain access to a system. It is not directly related to the preparation or execution of a DLL.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves loading a shared module (DLL) into a process. While it is related to DLLs, it does not specifically address the decoding or preparation of the DLL.
   - **C: T1053.006-Systemd Timers:** This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. It is not related to the preparation or execution of a DLL.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-standard protocols to communicate. It is not related to the preparation or execution of a DLL.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique is **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**. This technique directly addresses the process of decoding or deobfuscating the embedded DLL file before it can be executed.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol

**Correction:**
Upon re-evaluation, the correct answer should be:
Final Answer: B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
