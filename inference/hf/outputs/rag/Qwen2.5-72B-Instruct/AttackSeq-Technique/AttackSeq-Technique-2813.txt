### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Hi-Zor RAT:
     - Establishes persistence by creating a copy of itself with a '.dat' extension.
     - Modifies the registry run key using 'regsvr32.exe'.
     - Uses string-stacking and double XOR encoding to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves making files or information more difficult to understand or detect, which aligns with the use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves modifying the registry run keys to ensure the malware runs at system startup, which aligns with the persistence mechanism described.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique is the same as the one mentioned for privilege escalation, reinforcing the persistence mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which is not directly related to the described obfuscation techniques.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
     - This technique involves communication between processes, which is not directly related to the described obfuscation techniques.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves making files or information more difficult to understand or detect, which aligns with the use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal**
     - This technique involves bypassing network address translation, which is not directly related to the described obfuscation techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is the one that involves obfuscation to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
