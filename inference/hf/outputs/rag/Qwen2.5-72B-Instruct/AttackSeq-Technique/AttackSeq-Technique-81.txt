### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where OnionDog penetrates network isolation using USB worms, similar to the Stuxnet approach. After successfully penetrating the network, the Trojan releases and downloads additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware across network segments.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique is also about using removable media to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves adversaries transferring tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. This aligns well with the scenario where the Trojan releases and downloads additional malware.
   - **B: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription:** This technique involves adversaries using WMI event subscriptions to execute code. This does not fit the scenario of downloading additional malware.
   - **C: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves adversaries using methods to bridge network boundaries, but it does not specifically address the downloading of additional malware.
   - **D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication:** This technique involves adversaries using one-way communication channels, which is not relevant to the scenario of downloading additional malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**. This technique directly aligns with the scenario where the Trojan releases and downloads additional malware after penetrating the network using USB worms.

**Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
