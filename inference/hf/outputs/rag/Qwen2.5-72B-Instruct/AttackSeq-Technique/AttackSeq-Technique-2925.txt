### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT41:
     - Used rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence.
     - Added stealth by executing before the operating system initializes.
     - Before accessing credentials within the compromised systems with keyloggers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
     - This technique involves using messaging applications to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. It does not align with the described sequence of using rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence and stealth.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to coincide with specific events. While it could be used for stealth, it does not specifically relate to the use of bootkits or pre-OS execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to run malicious code. It does not align with the described sequence of using rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence and stealth.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
     - This technique involves executing code before the operating system initializes, which aligns perfectly with the described use of rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence and stealth. The related TTPs also confirm the use of bootkits for both defense evasion and persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1542-Pre-OS Boot**.

**Final Answer: D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
