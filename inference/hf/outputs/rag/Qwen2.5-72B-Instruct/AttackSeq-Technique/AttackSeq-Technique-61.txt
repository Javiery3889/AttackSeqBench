### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the successful execution of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware, specifically focusing on evading detection and loading the malware without alerting defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.009-Break Process Trees:** This technique involves manipulating process trees to hide the relationship between malicious and legitimate processes, making it harder for security tools to detect the malicious activity.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to load malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending malicious files via email to trick users into opening them. While this is a common initial infection vector, it does not directly relate to evading detection after the malware is loaded.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While it is related to execution, it does not specifically address evasion.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which can help evade detection by security tools. This is a strong candidate for evasion after the malware is loaded.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate processes to execute malicious code. While it can be used for evasion, it is more about subverting the normal execution flow rather than directly loading malware.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading** is the most plausible technique for evading detection and loading the malware without alerting defenses. Reflective code loading allows the malware to be loaded directly into memory, bypassing many file-based detection mechanisms.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading
