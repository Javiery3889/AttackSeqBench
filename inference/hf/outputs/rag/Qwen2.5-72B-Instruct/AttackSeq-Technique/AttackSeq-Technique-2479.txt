### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to maintain access to victim systems after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager and before using reflective code loading to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique is used to load and execute code in memory without writing it to disk, which helps in evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to download and run malicious payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While it is useful for evading network-based detection, it does not directly help in maintaining access to the victim system.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at specific intervals. This can be used to maintain persistence on the victim system, ensuring that the attacker can regain access even if the initial foothold is lost.
   - **C: T1136-Create Account:** This technique involves creating new user accounts on the victim system. While it can be used to maintain access, it is more about gaining new credentials rather than ensuring continuous access.
   - **D: T1098.005-Device Registration:** This technique involves registering a device with a service to gain access to resources. It is not typically used for maintaining access to a victim system in the context of a typical attack sequence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible technique for maintaining access to the victim system, given the context of using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager and then using reflective code loading to evade defenses, is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**. This technique ensures that the malicious code is executed periodically, allowing the attacker to maintain a persistent presence on the system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
