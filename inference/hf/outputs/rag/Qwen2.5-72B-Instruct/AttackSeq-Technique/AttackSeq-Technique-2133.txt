### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a heavily obfuscated script ('install.vbs') is executed, followed by another script ('stopedge.bat') that deletes other files ('versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs').

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to remove traces of the attacker's activities.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:** This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the deletion of files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the deletion of files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands, which aligns with the execution of 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat'.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' by 'stopedge.bat'.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The execution of 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' involves the use of scripts to perform actions, which aligns with T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
   - The deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' by 'stopedge.bat' aligns with T1070.004-File Deletion, which is a sub-technique of T1070-Indicator Removal.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
