### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the Duke group gained initial access using 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails but before they leveraged Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Duke group used the technique T1550.003 (Pass the Ticket) for lateral movement and defense evasion.
   - This suggests that the sequence of events includes gaining initial access, followed by some intermediate steps, and then using pass-the-ticket for credential access.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading:**
     - Masquerading involves making a file or program appear legitimate or benign to avoid detection. This could be a plausible step after gaining initial access to hide the presence of the malware.
   - **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:**
     - Exfiltration over web service involves sending data to an external web service. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has already gained access and is ready to steal data.
   - **C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager:**
     - AppDomainManager is a specific sub-technique under T1574 (Hijack Execution Flow) that involves manipulating the .NET AppDomainManager to execute arbitrary code. This is a sophisticated technique that might be used for persistence or defense evasion but is less likely to be a direct step before pass-the-ticket.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:**
     - Hide Artifacts involves concealing the presence of the malware or its activities. This is a common step after gaining initial access to avoid detection and maintain a foothold in the network.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the context, the most logical sequence would be:
     1. Gain initial access using 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails.
     2. Hide artifacts to avoid detection.
     3. Use pass-the-ticket for credential access and lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
