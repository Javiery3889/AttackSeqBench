### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where BlackSoul has already communicated with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and hosted its infrastructure on Cloudflare Workers Service.
   - We need to determine the most likely next step in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.007-Serverless:** This technique involves using serverless architectures (like Cloudflare Workers) to host infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication. Given that the C2 communication is already established using web protocols, this is a plausible next step.
   - **B: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL:** This technique involves modifying the Netsh helper DLL to achieve persistence. This is less likely to be the next step immediately after setting up C2 communication and infrastructure.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. Since the question implies that the C2 communication and infrastructure are already set up, this is not a likely next step.
   - **D: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository. While this is a form of exfiltration, it is less common and specific compared to exfiltration over the C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is exfiltration over the C2 channel, as it directly follows the establishment of C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
