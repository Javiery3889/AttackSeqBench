### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary delivers a malicious email with a Word attachment that exploits an embedded .LNK object to gain initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence involves storing a .LNK file in the Startup directory to ensure persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which is consistent with the initial access via a Word attachment.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves setting up persistence by placing a file in the Startup directory, which aligns with the persistence mechanism described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the initial execution or persistence mechanisms described.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. This is a plausible step between initial access and persistence, as the adversary might use a command-line interface to place the .LNK file in the Startup directory.
   - **C: T1059.002-AppleScript:** This technique is specific to macOS and involves using AppleScript to execute commands. Since the question does not specify a macOS environment, this is less likely to be relevant.
   - **D: T1592.002-Software:** This technique involves using legitimate software to maintain persistence. While this could be relevant, it is less specific to the described sequence of placing a .LNK file in the Startup directory.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through the malicious Word attachment, the adversary would use a command-line interface or script to place the .LNK file in the Startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - Therefore, the technique **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** is the most likely to occur before the persistence mechanism.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
