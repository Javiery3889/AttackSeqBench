### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     - Initial access via a watering hole attack exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
     - Privilege escalation using CVE-2015-1701.
   - We need to identify the technique that likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique describes how attackers use a watering hole attack to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:**
     - This technique describes how attackers exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1648-Serverless Execution:**
     - This technique involves executing code without the need for a traditional server. It is not typically used between gaining initial access and privilege escalation.
   - **B: T1562-Impair Defenses:**
     - This technique involves degrading or disabling security controls. While it can occur after gaining initial access, it is not a necessary step before privilege escalation.
   - **C: T1098-Account Manipulation:**
     - This technique involves modifying or creating accounts to maintain access. It is more likely to occur after privilege escalation.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. It is a common step after gaining initial access and before privilege escalation, as attackers often use command-line tools to explore the system and prepare for further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred between gaining initial access and privilege escalation is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
