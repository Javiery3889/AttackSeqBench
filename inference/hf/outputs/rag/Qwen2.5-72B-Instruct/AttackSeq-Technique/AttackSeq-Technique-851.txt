### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that facilitates keeping control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages, specifically after data collection and before data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves staging data in a remote location before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1218.015-Electron Applications:** This technique involves using Electron applications for persistence or execution. It does not directly relate to maintaining control through multiple communication stages.
   - **B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique is directly related to maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages, which aligns with the question.
   - **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing bidirectional communication, which is a part of maintaining control but does not specifically address multiple stages.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access, but it does not directly relate to maintaining control through multiple communication stages.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**.

Final Answer: B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
