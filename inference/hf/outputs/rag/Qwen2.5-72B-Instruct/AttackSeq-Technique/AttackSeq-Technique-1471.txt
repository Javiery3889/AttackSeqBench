### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker performs discovery by retrieving a gist snippet from GitHub to parse commands and gather system information.
   - The next step involves using the SLUB backdoor to collect data from the victim's system.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after the discovery phase and the use of the SLUB backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the victim's system.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This technique involves hooking into API functions to capture credentials. While this could be a part of a broader attack, it is not directly related to the collection of data after discovery.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning network protocols to capture and relay authentication requests. This is more related to network manipulation and not directly to data collection after discovery.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading or disabling security mechanisms. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to the collection of data after discovery.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the victim's screen. This is a plausible next step after discovery, as the attacker might want to gather visual information from the victim's system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After performing discovery and using the SLUB backdoor, the most logical next step would be to collect data from the victim's system.
   - Screen capture (T1113) is a common technique used to gather visual information, which can provide valuable insights into the victim's activities and environment.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture
