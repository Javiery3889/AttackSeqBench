### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used before initial access was achieved via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros.
   - The initial access technique mentioned is T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending emails with links to malicious websites.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments, such as Word documents with embedded macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1565-Data Manipulation:** This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, which is not relevant to the gathering of information about potential victims.
   - **T1596.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves using digital certificates, which is not related to the gathering of information about potential victims.
   - **T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information about potential victims, which aligns with the context of the question.
   - **T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:** This technique involves searching open technical databases for information, which could be relevant but is less specific to the context of phishing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first used T1598 (Phishing for Information) to gather information about potential victims before sending the spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
