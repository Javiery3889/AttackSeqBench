### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Agrius used wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD for destructive actions.
   - After these actions, Agrius used the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP for further coordination.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for communication with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data on a system, which aligns with the use of wipers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm:** This technique involves using legitimate Windows binaries to execute code. It is not directly related to communication with C2 servers or data destruction.
   - **B: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood:** This technique involves overwhelming services to cause denial of service. It is not related to communication with C2 servers or data destruction.
   - **C: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, which is a form of data destruction. However, the question already mentions the use of wipers, which are more directly destructive.
   - **D: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to access and control systems. It is not directly related to communication with C2 servers over HTTP.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique based on the context of the question is **T1071.001-Web Protocols**. This technique aligns with the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP for further coordination.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **D: T1021-Remote Services**

However, based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most accurate answer should be:

Final Answer: **T1071.001-Web Protocols** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant based on the context.)
