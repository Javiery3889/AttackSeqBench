### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained via spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker achieves persistence using an ActiveSetup registry key.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. This is a plausible choice because after gaining initial access and achieving persistence, the attacker would need to establish a communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves abusing mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is already used in the initial access phase (spear phishing emails). It is not relevant to the communication phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it could be used to obfuscate communication, it is not the most direct or common method for initial communication with the attacker's infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique for communicating with the attacker's infrastructure after gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
