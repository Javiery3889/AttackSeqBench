### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Emissary Panda, starting with exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to achieve initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers.
   - The next step involves gathering credentials using tools like Mimikatz to facilitate lateral movement.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the credential gathering.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique describes how the initial access was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application (SharePoint server in this case).
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique describes the use of tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials from the LSASS memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. This does not fit the context of gathering credentials.
   - **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to gathering credentials.
   - **C: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network configuration. This is a logical step before gathering credentials, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as usernames, email addresses, and other personal information. While this can be useful, it is not as directly related to the immediate step before credential gathering as T1592.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible technique that occurred before the actors gathered credentials using tools like Mimikatz is **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**. This step helps the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets for credential gathering.

**Final Answer: C: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
