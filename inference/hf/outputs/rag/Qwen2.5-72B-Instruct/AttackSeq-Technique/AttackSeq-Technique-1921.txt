### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - Specifically, it asks what technique likely occurred after APT10 used systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement.
   - The final step in the sequence is staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives and compressing them in locations like the Recycle Bin.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting and staging data on the local system before exfiltration. This aligns with the final step mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM):** This technique is used for lateral movement, which is mentioned in the question as a step that has already occurred. Therefore, it is not a plausible next step.
   - **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump):** This technique involves collecting data using SNMP, which is a network management protocol. It is not directly related to the staging and compression of data for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and archiving data, which aligns with the final step of staging data for exfiltration. This is a plausible next step after lateral movement.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending malicious emails to gain initial access. It is not relevant to the sequence described in the question, which is focused on post-lateral movement activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that after APT10 used systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement, they would then archive and compress the collected data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
