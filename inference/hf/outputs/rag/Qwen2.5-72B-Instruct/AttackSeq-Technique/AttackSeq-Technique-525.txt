### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware:
     - Uses anti-analysis techniques like sandbox detection.
     - Sets a registry key for persistence.
     - Establishes secure communications with a C2 server.
     - Adds an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves obfuscating data to make it harder to detect or analyze.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic, which is not directly related to establishing secure communications with a C2 server or adding obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**
     - This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol for remote access, which is not related to secure communications or obfuscation.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server, which aligns with the description of establishing secure communications and adding an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is mentioned in the question but not the primary focus of the secure communication and obfuscation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
