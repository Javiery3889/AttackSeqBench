### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Whitefly) has already used tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials and facilitate credential access.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to move laterally through the network using the harvested credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user and service accounts to maintain access and blend in with normal activity.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique is also about using legitimate accounts, but it is more focused on the initial access phase.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** This technique involves poisoning network protocols to capture and relay authentication requests, which can be used to gain access to additional systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.005-VNC:** This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to remotely control a system. While this can be used for lateral movement, it is not the most common or direct method after harvesting credentials.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is typically used in the credential access phase, not for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternate authentication methods, such as Kerberos tickets or NTLM hashes, to authenticate to systems. This is a common method for lateral movement after harvesting credentials.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves tricking internal users into providing access or credentials, which is more relevant to the initial access phase rather than lateral movement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after harvesting credentials, the attacker would use alternate authentication material to move laterally through the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
