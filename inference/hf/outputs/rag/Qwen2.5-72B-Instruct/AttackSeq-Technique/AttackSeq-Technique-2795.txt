### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to collect geo-location data from an iOS device after the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Tactic: Defense Evasion):** This technique involves making the malicious app appear legitimate to avoid detection.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System (Tactic: Collection):** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which can include various types of data such as files, system information, and user data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection during exfiltration. It is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves modifying or replacing authentication modules to gain access. It is not related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves collecting location data from the system, which is directly related to the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is the technique that directly involves collecting location data from the system.

**Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery**
