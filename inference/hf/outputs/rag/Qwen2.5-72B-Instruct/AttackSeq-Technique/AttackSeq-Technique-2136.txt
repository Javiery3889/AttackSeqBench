### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the execution of scripts (like 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs') that scheduled tasks or managed file deletions for Persistence, but before collecting system information for Exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic scripts to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This is a repetition of the first TTP, emphasizing the use of scheduled tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute code. Given that the scripts 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' are used to schedule tasks, this technique is highly relevant.
   - **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to the scheduling of tasks or file deletions.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. This could be relevant if the attacker needs to know what files to delete or manage, but it is not the most immediate next step after scheduling tasks.
   - **D: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves enumerating and reading log files. This is typically done to avoid detection and is not directly related to the scheduling of tasks or file deletions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The scripts 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' are used to schedule tasks, which aligns with T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.
   - After scheduling tasks, the next logical step would be to discover files and directories (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) to manage file deletions or other persistence mechanisms.
   - However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred after scheduling tasks but before collecting system information for exfiltration. The most plausible sequence is that the attacker would first ensure the persistence mechanism is in place (T1053-Scheduled Task/Job) and then proceed to discover files and directories (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
