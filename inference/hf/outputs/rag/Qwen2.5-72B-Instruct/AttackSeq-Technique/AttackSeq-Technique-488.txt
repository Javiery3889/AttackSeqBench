### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before the lightSpy malware used legitimate Apple developer certificates to execute payload.dylib and maintain stealth while exploiting CVE-2019-8605 for root privileges.
   - The key points are:
     - Use of legitimate Apple developer certificates.
     - Execution of payload.dylib.
     - Exploiting CVE-2019-8605 for root privileges.
     - Maintaining stealth.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate code signing certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear more trustworthy and evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking the System Integrity Protection (SIP) and trust providers to bypass security mechanisms. While it could be used for maintaining stealth, it is not directly related to the initial use of legitimate Apple developer certificates.
   - **B: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification:**
     - This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions on Windows systems. It is not relevant to the context of using Apple developer certificates or exploiting CVE-2019-8605.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website or link. While it could be used for initial access, it does not directly relate to the use of legitimate Apple developer certificates.
   - **D: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate system binaries to execute malicious code. It is a common method for maintaining stealth and evading detection, but it does not directly relate to the use of legitimate Apple developer certificates.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the use of legitimate Apple developer certificates is **T1553.002-Code Signing**. This technique is directly related to the use of legitimate certificates to sign malicious code, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1553.002-Code Signing**
