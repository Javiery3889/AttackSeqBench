### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater exploited CVE-2017-0199 through decoy documents to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, MuddyWater initiated communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code for the second stage of attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code on the victim's system.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the compromised system.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to victims when they visit the site.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves establishing bidirectional communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is a common technique, it does not specifically address the transfer of malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. This is not relevant to the second stage of the attack described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system. This aligns well with the scenario where MuddyWater initiates communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:**
     - This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection. This is not relevant to the transfer of malicious code in the second stage of the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**. This technique directly addresses the transfer of malicious code from the compromised servers to the victim's system, which is a key part of the second stage of the attack described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
