### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the NewPass agent has established communication with a command-and-control (C2) server using stealthy POST requests and encryption.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in this sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication, which aligns with the use of POST requests and encryption mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel. Given that the communication is already established, it is plausible that the next step could be to exfiltrate data.
   - **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which is similar to T1041 but more specific to web services. However, the question does not specify the use of a web service beyond the C2 communication.
   - **C: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**
     - This technique involves modifying the load command of a Mach-O binary to load a malicious library. This is not directly related to the C2 communication or data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using an encrypted channel for C2 communication. However, the question already states that the communication is using encryption, so this technique is not the next step but rather part of the initial setup.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible next step after establishing a stealthy and encrypted C2 channel is to exfiltrate data over that channel.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
