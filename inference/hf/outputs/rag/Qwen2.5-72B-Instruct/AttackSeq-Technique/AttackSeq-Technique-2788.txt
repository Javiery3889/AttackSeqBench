### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely preceded the deployment of malicious JavaScript code into the MiMi chat application's installers for Defense Evasion.
   - The focus is on how Iron Tiger compromised MiMi's servers and injected backdoors during the application build process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging:** This technique involves creating a new process in the context of an existing one to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript:** This technique involves executing JavaScript code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party software supply chain to deliver malicious code. This fits well with the scenario of deploying malicious code into the application's installers.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. While it could be relevant, it is more specific to web content and less likely to be the primary method for compromising the build process.
   - **C: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL:** This technique involves modifying the Netsh helper DLL to execute arbitrary code. This is more specific to system-level persistence and less likely to be the initial compromise method.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. While it could be used for exfiltration or command execution, it is not the primary method for initial compromise and backdoor injection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves a supply chain compromise (T1195) to gain access to MiMi's servers and inject backdoors during the application build process. This would allow Iron Tiger to deploy malicious JavaScript code into the installers for Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
