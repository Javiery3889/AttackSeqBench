### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the adversary used Cobalt Strike's built-in abilities (SMB and PsExec) for Lateral Movement to deploy beacons on additional systems within the victim's network.
   - The technique should occur before the adversary began collecting data from information repositories and user mailboxes for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique is used for Lateral Movement, which aligns with the use of SMB and PsExec.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to support Lateral Movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for Lateral Movement, which is not relevant to the use of SMB and PsExec.
   - **B: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions:** This technique involves adding email delegate permissions, which is more related to persistence and data collection rather than Lateral Movement.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access, which is not directly related to the use of SMB and PsExec for Lateral Movement.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a logical step after gaining access to additional systems via Lateral Movement and before exfiltrating data from information repositories and user mailboxes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred after Lateral Movement and before data exfiltration is **T1005-Data from Local System**.

**Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System**
