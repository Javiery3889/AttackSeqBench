### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word documents with malicious macros and links to malicious sites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1218.013-Mavinject**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL using the `mavinject` utility. This is typically used for persistence or execution, not for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a broad category that includes various forms of phishing, including spear-phishing. It aligns with the initial access method described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
     - This technique involves developing or acquiring tools and capabilities for an attack. It is a preparatory step but not directly related to the initial access method described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malware or tools. It is not directly related to the initial access method described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1566-Phishing**. This technique encompasses the spear-phishing emails with weaponized Word documents and links to malicious sites.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
