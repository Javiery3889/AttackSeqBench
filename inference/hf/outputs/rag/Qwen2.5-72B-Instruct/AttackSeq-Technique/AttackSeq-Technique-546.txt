### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where visitors to compromised websites are exposed to browser fingerprinting exploits for initial access, and malicious scripts communicate with C&C servers using HTTPS.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely involved in acquiring domain names and renting servers to support the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring domain names to support the attack.
   - **T1608.004-Drive-by Target:** This technique involves targeting users through drive-by attacks.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending fraudulent communications to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While phishing can be used to gain initial access, it does not directly involve acquiring domain names and renting servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1561-Disk Wipe:** This technique involves wiping data from disks, which is a post-compromise action and not related to acquiring infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:** This technique involves acquiring infrastructure such as domain names, servers, and other resources to support the attack. This aligns well with the question's requirement of acquiring domain names and renting servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584.006-Web Services:** This technique involves using web services to support the attack, but it does not specifically mention acquiring domain names and renting servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the question's requirement, the most plausible answer is **C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**.

**Final Answer: C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
