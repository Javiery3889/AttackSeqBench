### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses spear-phishing emails containing malicious URLs or exploit documents to harvest credentials or deploy malware.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT28 executed malware like GAMEFISH on victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
   - These TTPs indicate that the initial access to the victim's system is gained through phishing, specifically spear-phishing with links.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a common post-compromise technique, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access through phishing.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**
     - This technique involves removing persistence mechanisms, which is not relevant to the initial access phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools, which is not directly related to the initial access phase via phishing.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique is the initial access method described in the question. It is the technique used to gain initial access to the victim's system through spear-phishing emails containing malicious URLs or exploit documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the initial access was gained through phishing, specifically spear-phishing with links (T1566.002).

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
