### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Cinobi steals banking credentials through form-grabbing and web traffic modification.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used for communication with a C&C server using a .onion address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control communication.
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature.
   - **T1185-Browser Session Hijacking:** This technique involves taking over a user's browser session to perform actions on their behalf.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as certificate authorities or trusted root stores. It is not directly related to communication with a C&C server using a .onion address.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic. While it could be used for communication, it is not specifically tied to .onion addresses.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It is more relevant to the use of a .onion address, as .onion addresses are often accessed through the Tor network, which acts as a proxy.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to communication with a C&C server using a .onion address.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: T1090.002-External Proxy**. This technique aligns with the use of a .onion address, as it involves routing traffic through an external proxy, which is a key feature of the Tor network.

**Final Answer: C: T1090.002-External Proxy**
