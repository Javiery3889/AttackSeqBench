### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Korplug collects data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives, and then transfers the collected data to a C&C server.
   - The focus is on the technique used to transfer the collected data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to communicate with the C&C server, which is relevant to the data transfer part of the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using webhooks, which are HTTP callbacks. While this is a valid exfiltration method, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols, which could include various methods not typically used for standard communication. This is a plausible method for transferring data to a C&C server.
   - **C: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves modifying pluggable authentication modules, which is not related to data exfiltration or communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using fallback channels to maintain command and control when primary channels are disrupted. While this is related to command and control, it does not specifically address the exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for transferring collected data to a C&C server, given the context of the related TTPs, is **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**. This technique aligns with the need to transfer data using methods that may not be standard, which is consistent with the use of removable media for communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
