### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the Derusbi malware gathered host and system information and before it communicated with the C2 server using obfuscated HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature, often used to evade detection during C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to support multiple tools or capabilities. It is not directly related to the sequence of gathering information and communicating with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails. While it is related to C2, it is not a necessary step between gathering information and obfuscating data.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious files or programs to appear benign. It is more relevant to the initial stages of an attack, such as during the initial compromise or persistence, but not specifically between gathering information and C2 communication.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature. Given that the malware is using obfuscated HTTP POST requests to communicate with the C2 server, it is logical that data obfuscation would occur before the actual communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred after gathering host and system information and before the malware's communication with the C2 server is **T1001-Data Obfuscation**.

Final Answer: D: T1001-Data Obfuscation
