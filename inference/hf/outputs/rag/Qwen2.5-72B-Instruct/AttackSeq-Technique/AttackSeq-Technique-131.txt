### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique used by APT-TOCS before executing Shellcode scripts in memory for network communication via Beacon mode.
   - The focus is on the initial access phase of the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to escalate privileges.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access. While it can be used for initial access, it is less likely in the context of exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique aligns perfectly with the related TTPs, as it is explicitly mentioned in the context of initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
     - This technique involves communication between processes and is not typically used for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the registry to gain access, but it is more commonly used for persistence and privilege escalation rather than initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible initial access technique is **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
