### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before T9000 communicated with a C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port.
   - The key points are:
     - Encrypted traffic
     - Binary protocol
     - Specific port

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using a port that is not commonly associated with the service being used. This is relevant because the question mentions a specific port.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using a protocol that is not typically used for the application layer, which aligns with the use of a binary protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. This is highly relevant because the question mentions encrypted traffic.
   - **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation:** This technique involves using DNS to obfuscate C2 communications. While it is a method of obfuscation, it does not directly relate to the use of encrypted traffic or a binary protocol.
   - **C: T1123-Audio Capture:** This technique involves capturing audio data from a system. It is not relevant to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel. While it is related to C2 communications, it is more about the exfiltration phase rather than the initial communication setup.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique that aligns with the use of encrypted traffic and a binary protocol over a specific port is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**. This technique ensures that the communication is secure and encrypted, which is a necessary step before the actual communication with the C2 server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
