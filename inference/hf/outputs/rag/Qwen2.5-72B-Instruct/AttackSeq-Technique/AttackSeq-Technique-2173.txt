### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers send spear phishing emails that exploit Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before gaining initial access through the victim opening the OLE2 format attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - This means the attackers are using spear phishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's host, which is typically done after gaining some level of access or during the reconnaissance phase.
     - It is less likely to occur before the initial access through spear phishing.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is the broader category that includes spear phishing. The specific technique mentioned in the related TTPs is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
     - This is the technique that is directly described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is also typically done after gaining some level of access or during the reconnaissance phase.
     - It is less likely to occur before the initial access through spear phishing.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to gain access, which is not relevant to the spear phishing with attachments described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers used spear phishing with attachments to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access through the victim opening the OLE2 format attachments is T1566-Phishing.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
