### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial communication with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` before additional C2 domains were identified.
   - The focus is on the technique used to establish communication with the initial C2 domain.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains:** This technique involves acquiring or registering domains for use in a campaign.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves transferring data at specific times or intervals.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1001.001-Junk Data:** This technique involves adding junk data to obfuscate the true nature of the data. It is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 domain.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. It is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 domain.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a broad category that includes DNS, which is relevant to the question.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target. While it can be used to establish initial contact, it is not directly related to the communication with a C2 domain.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for establishing communication with a C2 domain is **T1071.004-DNS**. This technique is a sub-technique of T1071 and specifically involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C2 server, which aligns with the context of the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

However, to be more precise, the specific sub-technique T1071.004-DNS is the most relevant. Since the answer choices do not include this specific sub-technique, the closest and most appropriate choice is C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
