### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an APT group (APT29) uses a public exploit (CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) to gain initial access to a system.
   - After gaining initial access, the group maintains persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and using anonymizing services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to evade detection and maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity:** This technique involves using hybrid identity to gain access, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate, which is not directly related to the sequence of obtaining and using legitimate credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to maintain access, which aligns with the sequence described in the question. The related TTPs specifically mention T1078-Valid Accounts in both the Defense Evasion and Persistence tactics.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT29 used T1078-Valid Accounts to maintain persistent access after gaining initial access through the public exploit.

**Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
