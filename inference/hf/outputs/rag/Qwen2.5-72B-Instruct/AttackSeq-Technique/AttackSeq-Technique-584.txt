### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers gained credential access using Mimikatz and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks. They then used webshells and dumped credentials to execute commands on other systems within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to a remote system.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.002-Security Account Manager:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email data from a local email client. It does not align with the described sequence of using webshells and executing commands on other systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a running process. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly align with the described sequence of lateral movement and command execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to access and control systems. It aligns well with the described sequence of using webshells and executing commands on other systems within the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for remote access. It does not align with the described sequence of using webshells and executing commands on other systems within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the described sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is **C: T1021-Remote Services**. This technique aligns with the use of webshells and the execution of commands on other systems within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
