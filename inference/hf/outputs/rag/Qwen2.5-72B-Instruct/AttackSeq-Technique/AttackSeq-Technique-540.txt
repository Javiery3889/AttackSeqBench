### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where PIVY establishes persistence by installing itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to evade detection while utilizing DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves adding a program to the Windows Startup folder or Registry Run keys to ensure it runs automatically when the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1200-Hardware Additions**
     - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or maintain persistence. It does not align with the described scenario of DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting**
     - This technique involves creating fake security alerts to mislead users or administrators. It does not directly relate to evading detection through DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network traffic to evade detection. This aligns well with the scenario of evading detection while using DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common network protocols to communicate with a remote system. It does not directly relate to evading detection through DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique aligns with the need to evade detection while utilizing DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
