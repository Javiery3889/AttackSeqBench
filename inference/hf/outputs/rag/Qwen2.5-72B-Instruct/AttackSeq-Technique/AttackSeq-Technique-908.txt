### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Dexphot malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using software bundlers to drop its installer.
     - Using obfuscated batch scripts to evade defenses.
     - Using process hollowing to execute malicious code within legitimate system processes.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the process hollowing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion
     - Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
   - This indicates that the focus is on techniques used to evade defenses and execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, file extensions, or other artifacts to avoid detection.
     - While this could be part of the evasion strategy, it is not specifically tied to the execution of malicious code within processes.
   - **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking COM objects to execute malicious code.
     - This is a method of persistence and could be used to ensure the malware runs at system startup, but it is not directly related to the immediate execution of code within processes.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions that might be used to execute code.
     - This could be a plausible step before process hollowing, as it might be used to manipulate processes and inject code.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute code.
     - Given that the question mentions the use of obfuscated batch scripts, this is a strong candidate for the step before process hollowing.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of obfuscated batch scripts to evade defenses suggests that the malware is using scripting to perform actions that lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - The most likely step before process hollowing, given the context of using obfuscated batch scripts, is the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute the necessary commands to prepare for process hollowing.

### Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
