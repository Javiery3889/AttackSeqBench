### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker gains persistence by creating a service named `msupdate2` and copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing command and control (C2) through uncompressed communication with the C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the C2 communication was established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **B: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves using messaging applications for C2, which is not mentioned in the sequence.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services for C2, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information, which is a common step before establishing C2 to understand the environment and plan further actions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves gaining persistence and then establishing C2. Before establishing C2, it is common for attackers to gather system information to understand the environment and plan their next steps.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before C2 was established is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery
