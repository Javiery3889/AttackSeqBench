### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in Operation NightScout.
   - The sequence includes gaining initial access through a supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism.
   - The next step is extracting C&C information to a file on the victim's system.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to evade detection between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1070.006-Timestomp:** This technique involves modifying the timestamps of a file to make it harder to detect or analyze.
   - **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading files, directories, or services to make them appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1497.001-System Checks**
     - This technique involves checking the system for the presence of security tools or other indicators that might detect the attack. It is not directly related to evading detection by modifying files or system artifacts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, directories, or other artifacts to evade detection. This is a broad category that could include timestomping or masquerading.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique is already mentioned as part of the initial access phase and is not relevant to the evasion step.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice communication to trick victims into providing information or performing actions. It is not relevant to the evasion step.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1070.006-Timestomp** and **T1036-Masquerading** are both techniques that can be used to evade detection.
   - **T1070.006-Timestomp** is more specific to modifying file timestamps, which is a common evasion technique.
   - **T1036-Masquerading** involves renaming or masquerading files, which is also a common evasion technique.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique to evade detection between gaining initial access and extracting C&C information is **T1036-Masquerading**. This technique aligns well with the need to make files appear legitimate to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts

However, based on the specific techniques provided in the related TTPs, the most precise answer is:

Final Answer: T1036-Masquerading (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most accurate based on the related TTPs. If we must choose from the given options, the closest is B: T1564-Hide Artifacts.)
