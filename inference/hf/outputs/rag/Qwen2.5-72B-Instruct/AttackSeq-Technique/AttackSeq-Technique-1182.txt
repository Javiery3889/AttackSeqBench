### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a backdoor collects machine information and screenshots, and then sends this data to a C&C server.
   - The focus is on the technique used to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing:** This technique involves manipulating DHCP responses to redirect network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves sending data to a C&C server over a command and control channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. It does not fit the context of enabling communication or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
     - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. It is related to the collection phase but not to the communication or exfiltration phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with a C&C server. It fits the context of enabling communication and transmitting data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from a C&C server to the victim's network. It is more about the initial setup or additional tooling rather than ongoing communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **T1102-Web Service**. This technique aligns with the need to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
