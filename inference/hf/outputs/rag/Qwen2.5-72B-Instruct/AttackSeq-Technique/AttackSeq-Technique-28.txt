### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by UNC1945, a threat actor.
   - They established persistence by placing a legitimate pam_unix.so file and the SLAPSTICK backdoor in the /lib64/security folder.
   - They then used the custom ELF utility LOGBLEACH to clean logs, which is an anti-forensics technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):** This technique involves modifying PAM configurations to maintain persistence.
   - **T1070.006-Timestomp:** This technique involves modifying file timestamps to evade detection.
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves placing malicious files in locations or with names that mimic legitimate files to avoid suspicion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. It does not align with the described sequence of actions, which focuses on persistence and anti-forensics.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1216.001-PubPrn**
     - This technique involves using the pubprn.vbs script to execute arbitrary code. It is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to evade detection. The use of LOGBLEACH to clean logs is a form of indicator removal, but the question asks what occurred before this step.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to maintain persistence. While it is a persistence technique, it does not align with the specific method described (modifying PAM configurations).

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):** Establish persistence by placing the legitimate pam_unix.so file and the SLAPSTICK backdoor in the /lib64/security folder.
     2. **T1070.006-Timestomp:** Modify file timestamps to evade detection.
     3. **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** Place the backdoor in a location that mimics a legitimate file.
     4. **T1070-Indicator Removal:** Use LOGBLEACH to clean logs.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal
