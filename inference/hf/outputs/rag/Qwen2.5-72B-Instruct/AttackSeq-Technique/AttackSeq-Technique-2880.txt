### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a dropper malware delivers the main Bisonal payload and then establishes persistence by creating a registry entry for boot or logon autostart execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the technique T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is relevant to both Privilege Escalation and Persistence tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. It is not directly related to the establishment of persistence or the delivery of a payload.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is explicitly mentioned in the question and the related TTPs. It involves creating a registry entry to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon, which aligns with the described sequence.
   - **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves establishing bidirectional communication with a remote system. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after establishing persistence.
   - **D: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**
     - This technique involves adding a public key to the authorized keys file to gain persistent access to a system. It is not directly related to the described sequence of events.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is that the dropper malware delivered the payload and then used T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) to establish persistence.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
