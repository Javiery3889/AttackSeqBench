### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the Aria-body backdoor collected system information (host-name, username, system architecture) but before it engaged in collecting file metadata and taking screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and architecture.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves the adversary capturing screenshots of the victim's screen.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves determining the physical or logical location of the system. While this could be part of the discovery phase, it is not directly related to the collection of system information or the preparation for file metadata and screen capture.
   - **B: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary identifying active user accounts, which is a logical step after collecting system information and before engaging in more detailed collection activities like file metadata and screen capture.
   - **C: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves a method of opening ports on a firewall by sending a sequence of connection attempts to a set of closed ports. This is not related to the discovery or collection phases described in the question.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications. While this could be used during the attack, it is not a discovery or collection technique and does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the backdoor collecting system information (T1082) and then moving on to more detailed collection activities like file metadata and screen capture (T1113). The most logical step between these two phases is to discover active user accounts (T1087), as this information is crucial for further collection and exploitation activities.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1087-Account Discovery
