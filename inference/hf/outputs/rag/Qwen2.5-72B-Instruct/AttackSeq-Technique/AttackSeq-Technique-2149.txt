### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where the malware has already achieved persistence using a RunOnce key in the registry and is about to establish command and control through Process Hollowing.
   - We need to identify what likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection and establish command and control.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves setting up a registry key to ensure the malware runs at system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This is a broader category that includes T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. Since the malware has already achieved persistence using a RunOnce key, this is not the next step.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves the malware discovering running processes on the system. This is a logical step before Process Hollowing, as the malware needs to identify a suitable process to inject into.
   - **C: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves discovering trust relationships in a domain, which is not directly related to the sequence of achieving persistence and establishing command and control.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery:** This is the same as option B and is a logical step before Process Hollowing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the malware would discover running processes (T1057-Process Discovery) before injecting into a process through Process Hollowing (T1055.012-Process Hollowing).

**Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery**
