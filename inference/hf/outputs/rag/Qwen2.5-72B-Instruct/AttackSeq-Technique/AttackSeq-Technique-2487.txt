### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before the adversaries initiated their attack with spear phishing emails to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - The focus is on the preparation phase, specifically the acquisition and preparation of infrastructure such as domains and malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves adversaries gathering information about domain properties, which is crucial for setting up and using domains in their operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token:** This technique is related to privilege escalation and does not fit the context of infrastructure preparation.
   - **B: T1608.002-Upload Tool:** This technique involves uploading tools to a target system, which is more relevant to the execution phase rather than the preparation phase.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique is about setting up persistence mechanisms and is not related to infrastructure preparation.
   - **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing or acquiring tools, exploits, and other capabilities necessary for the attack. This aligns well with the preparation phase, including the acquisition and preparation of infrastructure such as domains and malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversaries developed capabilities (T1587) before initiating the attack with spear phishing emails.

**Final Answer: D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
