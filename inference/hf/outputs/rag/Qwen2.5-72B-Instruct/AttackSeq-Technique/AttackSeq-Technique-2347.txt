### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the use of native tools like `vssadmin` to create volume shadow copies and retrieve the `NTDS.dit` file.
   - The key points are:
     - WMI event consumers were used for persistence.
     - Privilege escalation was performed using `vssadmin` to create volume shadow copies and retrieve the `NTDS.dit` file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the `NTDS.dit` file, which is a critical step in the attack sequence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - This technique involves using WMI event consumers for persistence, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1006-Direct Volume Access**
     - This technique involves accessing the volume directly, which is related to the use of `vssadmin` to create volume shadow copies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1505.004-IIS Components**
     - This technique involves compromising IIS components, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552.002-Credentials in Registry**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from the registry, which could be a plausible step before using `vssadmin` to create volume shadow copies and retrieve the `NTDS.dit` file. However, it is not as directly related to the sequence as the other options.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs, which could be used for persistence and could logically precede the use of `vssadmin` to create volume shadow copies and retrieve the `NTDS.dit` file. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that a scheduled task or job was created to maintain persistence, which then led to the use of `vssadmin` to create volume shadow copies and retrieve the `NTDS.dit` file.

**Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
