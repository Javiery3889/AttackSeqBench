### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where customer credit card data is intercepted at store checkout pages.
   - The data is then sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the stolen data was sent to the server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves monitoring network traffic to capture sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique is used to capture credentials by monitoring network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method:** This technique involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be used to obfuscate the data before exfiltration, it is not the most likely technique to occur immediately before sending the data to the server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of intercepted data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1037.003-Network Logon Script:** This technique involves using logon scripts to execute commands. It is not relevant to the exfiltration of intercepted data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information. While it could be used to obtain initial access, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of intercepted data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique from the related TTPs is **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**. This technique is part of the Collection tactic and involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration. This is a common step to ensure that the data is efficiently and securely sent to the collection server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **D: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
