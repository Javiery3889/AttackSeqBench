### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com.
   - The key point here is the method of gaining initial access, which involves tricking users into downloading a fake app.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users when they visit the site.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending targeted emails with links to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is typically used for persistence or privilege escalation, not for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification**
     - This technique involves changing file and directory permissions, which is also typically used for persistence or to facilitate other actions, not for initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate websites or applications, which could be used to trick users into downloading a fake app. However, it is more specific to web content and not necessarily the initial step in this scenario.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves sending deceptive communications to trick users into performing actions, such as clicking on a link or downloading a file. The sub-technique T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is particularly relevant, as it involves sending targeted emails with links to malicious content.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers used a phishing technique to trick users into downloading the fake app. The sub-technique T1566.002-Spearphishing Link aligns well with the scenario described.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
