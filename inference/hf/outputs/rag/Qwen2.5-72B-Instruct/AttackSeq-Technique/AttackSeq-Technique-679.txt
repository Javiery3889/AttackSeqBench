### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Stuxnet used stolen digital certificates for kernel-mode drivers to appear legitimate and then propagated laterally through networks using vulnerabilities like MS08-067 RPC.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems.
   - **T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware.
   - **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1014 - Rootkit:** This technique involves using rootkits to hide the presence of malware. While rootkits can be used to maintain persistence and evade detection, they are not directly related to the lateral movement described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1505.002 - Transport Agent:** This technique involves using transport agents to intercept and modify email traffic. This is not relevant to the lateral movement through network vulnerabilities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1080 - Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. While this can be a method of lateral movement, it is not specifically related to the use of vulnerabilities like MS08-067 RPC.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.006 - Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking dynamic linkers to execute malicious code. This is more related to persistence and execution rather than lateral movement.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most relevant technique for the lateral movement described in the question is **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**. This technique directly aligns with the use of vulnerabilities like MS08-067 RPC to propagate laterally through networks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
