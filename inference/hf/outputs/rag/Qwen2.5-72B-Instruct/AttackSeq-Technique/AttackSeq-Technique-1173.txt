### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where spear-phishing is used to gather authentication credentials. After this, the attacker achieves persistent access by dropping further tooling or obtaining legitimate credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This indicates that valid accounts are used to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This indicates that valid accounts are used to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1558.005-Ccache Files:** This indicates that ccache files are used to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:** This is the initial technique used to gather authentication credentials, but it does not describe what happens after the credentials are obtained.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts, which aligns with the related TTPs for both initial access and persistence. It is the most likely technique to occur after obtaining credentials through spear-phishing.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm:** This technique involves using regsvcs/regasm for persistence, but it does not directly relate to the use of valid accounts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**.

**Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
