### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT-TOCS uses "powershell.exe" in memory to execute Shellcode script functionalities without writing to the hard disk.
   - After this, the APT-TOCS exhibits multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1059.001-PowerShell, which is part of the Execution tactic.
   - This technique involves adversaries using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059.006-Python**
     - This technique involves using Python to execute commands and scripts.
     - It is not directly related to the use of PowerShell or the execution of Shellcode in memory.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This is a broader technique that includes the use of various command shells and scripting languages, including PowerShell.
     - It is a parent technique that encompasses T1059.001-PowerShell.
   - **C: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping the disk structure, which is not relevant to the execution of Shellcode in memory or multi-beacon communication.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate or hide it, which can be used to evade detection.
     - It is plausible that after executing Shellcode in memory, the APT-TOCS might use data encoding to obfuscate the multi-beacon communication.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after executing Shellcode in memory using PowerShell, the APT-TOCS would use data encoding to obfuscate the multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - Therefore, the technique T1132-Data Encoding fits best in this context.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding
