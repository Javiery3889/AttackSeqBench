### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT12, starting with spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158 for initial access.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoors (HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT) established communication with their C2 servers to maintain Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking an existing SSH session. This is not relevant to the initial access or the establishment of C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a plausible technique that would occur after initial access to establish and maintain C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute malicious code. While this could be used to establish a backdoor, it is not specifically about establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While this could be used to maintain persistence, it is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible technique that would occur before the backdoors establish communication with their C2 servers is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
