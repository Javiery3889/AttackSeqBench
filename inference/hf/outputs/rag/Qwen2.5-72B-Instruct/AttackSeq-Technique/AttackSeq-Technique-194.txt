### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after FamousSparrow used `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor in the Execution phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is **Execution** and the Technique is **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**.
   - This means that the initial action involved using the Windows command shell to execute commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending malicious attachments via email to trick users into executing them. This is typically an initial access technique, not something that would occur after the backdoor is installed.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. Again, this is an initial access technique and not something that would occur after the backdoor is installed.
   - **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain higher privileges or access to other accounts. This is a common post-exploitation technique that could occur after the backdoor is installed to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.
   - **D: T1597-Search Closed Sources**
     - This technique involves searching closed sources for information, which is not typically a post-exploitation technique and does not align with the context of installing a backdoor.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that after the backdoor is installed, the attacker would likely attempt to manipulate access tokens to gain higher privileges or access to other accounts.

**Final Answer: C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
