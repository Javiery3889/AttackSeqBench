### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN13 used custom passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server for incoming requests within the victim's environment.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial setup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communications.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using traffic signaling to maintain persistence, often by embedding commands or data in network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communications to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which is typically used for initial access, not for post-compromise activities.
   - **B: T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves placing a component on a server to maintain persistence or C2. This could be relevant if the HTTP server is used for persistence, but it doesn't directly follow the establishment of a local HTTP server.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. This is a common next step after establishing a foothold, as it allows the attacker to perform various actions on the compromised system.
   - **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves using messaging applications for C2, which is less likely in this context compared to web protocols or non-standard ports.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the local HTTP server is established for incoming requests, the most likely next step would be to use this server for command and control (C2) communications.
   - The related TTPs suggest that web protocols (T1071.001) and non-standard ports (T1571) are used for C2, which aligns with the use of an HTTP server.
   - The most plausible next step after establishing the HTTP server would be to use it to execute commands and scripts, which is covered by T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
