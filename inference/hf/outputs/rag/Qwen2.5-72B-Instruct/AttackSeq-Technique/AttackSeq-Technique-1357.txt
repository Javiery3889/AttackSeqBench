### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where NewsBeef used obfuscated JavaScript injection to evade detection and maintain server persistence.
   - The focus is on the communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to establish and maintain a connection with the C2 server.
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect or understand.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**
     - This technique involves using file transfer protocols (e.g., FTP, SFTP) for communication. While it is a valid method for C2 communication, it is not the most specific or relevant given the context of obfuscation and multi-stage channels.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising the supply chain to gain access to a target. It is not relevant to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) for C2 communication. Given the context of obfuscation and multi-stage channels, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking dynamic libraries to execute malicious code. It is not relevant to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique aligns with the need for communication between the Pupy backdoor and the C2 server, especially in the context of obfuscation and multi-stage channels.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
