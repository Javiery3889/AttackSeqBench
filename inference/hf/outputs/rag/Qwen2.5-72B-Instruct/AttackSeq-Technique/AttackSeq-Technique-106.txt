### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Waterbear uses API hooking to evade detection by modifying functions in memory. After this, the malware connects to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to execute commands or actions.
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise to evade detection.
   - **T1027.009-Embedded Payloads:** This technique involves embedding payloads within other files or data to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route network traffic. While it can be used for evasion, it is not directly related to receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malware. It is not directly related to connecting to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system. This aligns well with the scenario where the malware connects to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. While it can be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not directly describe the act of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after Waterbear uses API hooking to evade detection, it connects to external entities to receive additional payloads or files, which is best described by T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
