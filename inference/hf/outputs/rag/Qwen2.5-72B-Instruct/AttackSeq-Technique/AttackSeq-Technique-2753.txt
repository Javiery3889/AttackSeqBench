### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack vector where attackers send spear phishing emails containing compressed executables or phishing links to senior executives.
   - The goal of this initial attack is to gather initial information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This sub-technique specifically involves sending spear phishing emails with links to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1592.003-Firmware:** This technique involves collecting information from firmware, which is not typically a next step after initial access via phishing.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate, which could be a next step after gaining initial access, but it is not specifically about gathering information.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which aligns well with the goal of the initial attack described in the question.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using resource forking to hide data, which is not typically a next step after initial access via phishing.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial spear phishing emails are sent and the attackers gain access, they would then use phishing to gather more information, which aligns with the goal of the initial attack.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information
