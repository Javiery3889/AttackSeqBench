### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for collecting information related to the target's system details.
   - The sequence of events is:
     - Before using compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement.
     - After using encrypted configuration files for defense evasion.
   - We need to identify the technique that fits the collection of system details.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using legitimate user and service accounts to perform actions that mimic normal user behavior.
     - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This sub-technique involves using domain accounts to move laterally within a network.
     - **T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This sub-technique involves using local accounts to gain access to specific systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices connected to a system. It is not directly related to collecting system details.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, such as credentials. While it can lead to gaining access, it is not specifically about collecting system details.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. This fits the requirement of collecting system details.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1087.001-Local Account**
     - This sub-technique involves identifying local accounts on a system. While it can be part of the reconnaissance process, it is more specific to account discovery rather than general system details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **T1082-System Information Discovery** because it directly involves collecting information about the target's system details, which fits the sequence of events described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
