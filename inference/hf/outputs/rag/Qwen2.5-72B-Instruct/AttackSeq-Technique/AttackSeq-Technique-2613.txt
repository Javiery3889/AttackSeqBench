### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Sednit group.
   - Specifically, it mentions that the group gathered information about the victim's system through a spoofed URL and then ensured persistence using a scheduled task.
   - We need to determine which technique likely occurred before the scheduled task was used for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
   - Both of these techniques involve using a scheduled task to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick the victim into performing an action.
     - It is not directly related to the use of a spoofed URL or the creation of a scheduled task.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This is the technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
     - However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before the scheduled task was used for persistence.
   - **C: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
     - This technique involves manipulating the kernel callback table to maintain persistence.
     - It is not directly related to the use of a spoofed URL or the creation of a scheduled task.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to trick the victim into providing information or performing an action.
     - The use of a spoofed URL is a common method in phishing attacks to gather information about the victim's system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events described in the question is:
     1. The attacker uses a spoofed URL to gather information about the victim's system.
     2. The attacker then ensures persistence using a scheduled task.
   - The technique that likely occurred before the scheduled task was used for persistence is the initial phishing attack that used the spoofed URL to gather information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
