### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collected system details for assessment during the discovery phase.
   - The focus is on the next step in the attack sequence, specifically related to data acquisition from the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1082-System Information Discovery, which is part of the Discovery tactic. This technique involves gathering system information to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1070.003-Clear Command History**
     - This technique involves clearing command history to cover tracks and avoid detection. It is not directly related to data acquisition.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is typically used to reveal hidden or encoded data. It is not directly related to data acquisition.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to prepare it for exfiltration. While it is related to data handling, it is a step that typically follows data collection.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a direct step in data acquisition. After gathering system information, the next logical step would be to collect specific data from the local system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers would collect data from the local system after gathering system information.

**Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System**
