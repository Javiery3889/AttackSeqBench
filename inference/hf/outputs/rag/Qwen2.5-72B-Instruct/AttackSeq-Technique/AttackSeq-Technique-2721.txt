### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before the Lazarus group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - The key points are:
     - The group is Lazarus.
     - The initial access method is spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access
     - Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   - This indicates that the initial access method is specifically spear-phishing with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It is not typically used for initial access but rather for lateral movement within a network.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This is a broader category that includes various forms of phishing, including spear-phishing. However, it is not specific enough to the context of the question.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the network configuration of a system, which is typically used after gaining access to a system, not before.
   - **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick individuals into providing information or performing actions. It is not relevant to the context of spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique to the context of the question is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This technique directly aligns with the method described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing

However, for the most precise answer, it should be noted that the specific technique is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which is a sub-technique of T1566-Phishing. Since the answer choices do not include T1566.001, the closest and most appropriate choice is B: T1566-Phishing.
