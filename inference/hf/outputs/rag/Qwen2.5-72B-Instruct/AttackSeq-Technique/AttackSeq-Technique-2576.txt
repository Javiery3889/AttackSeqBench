### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, specifically what technique likely occurred after the attacker used a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions to execute code.
   - The final step mentioned is obfuscating a JavaScript payload to hinder analysis.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution**
   - **Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) to execute code, which aligns with the use of a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is not directly related to the execution of code or the use of VBA macros.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves phishing, which is a method of initial access, not execution of code.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute code, which is a logical next step after using VBA macros to execute code.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command, which is not directly related to the execution of code or the use of VBA macros.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the attacker used a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions to execute code, they would use a command and scripting interpreter (T1059) to further execute the JavaScript payload.
   - This aligns with the related TTPs, as T1059.005 (Visual Basic) is part of the T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) family.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
