### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
     - They executed credential harvesting using Responder.
     - They gained login credentials for lateral movement.
     - They then moved on to network share and system network connections discovery activities.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the network share and system network connections discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique is used to capture credentials from network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves poisoning LLMNR and NBT-NS responses to capture and relay credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute code. It is not directly related to network discovery or credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering active network connections on a system. This aligns with the question's mention of network share and system network connections discovery activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. It is not related to network discovery or credential harvesting.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying the owner or user of a system. While it is related to discovery, it is not as directly relevant to network connections and shares as T1049.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that the Lazarus group would have performed **System Network Connections Discovery (T1049)** before moving on to network share and system network connections discovery activities.

**Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
