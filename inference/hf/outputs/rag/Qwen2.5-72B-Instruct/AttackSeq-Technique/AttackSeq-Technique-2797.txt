### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the XAgent malware is executed on iOS 7, hides the app icon, and automatically restarts. After this, it collects information like contact lists, text messages, and Wi-Fi status, and sends this information to a command and control (C2) server via POST.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery:** This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks, which is relevant to the collection of Wi-Fi status information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. While it could be part of the malware's initial reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the collection of specific data like contact lists, text messages, and Wi-Fi status.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious code. While this could be the initial entry point for the malware, the question is asking about what happens after the malware is already executing and collecting data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1012-Query Registry:** This technique involves querying the Windows registry, which is not applicable to iOS.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves modifying Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) on Unix-like systems, which is not relevant to iOS.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the collection of specific data (contact lists, text messages, and Wi-Fi status) before exfiltration is **T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery**. This technique aligns with the discovery of Wi-Fi status, which is part of the data collected by the malware.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1204-User Execution**

However, upon re-evaluation, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the context of the question and the related TTPs is:

Final Answer: **T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery** (Note: This is not one of the provided answer choices, but it is the most relevant based on the context. If we must choose from the provided options, the closest relevant answer is B: T1204-User Execution, but it is not the most accurate.)
