### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon, after using a backdoor to list interesting files during the discovery phase, is now looking to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1596.002-WHOIS**
     - WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is used to query databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name or an IP address block. This technique is not related to collecting data from the local system or network shares.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as modifying security settings or bypassing security mechanisms. It is not related to collecting data from the local system or network shares.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the system. Given that the backdoor is already in place and is listing interesting files, automated collection is a plausible next step to gather sensitive documents.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - This technique involves using Confluence, a collaboration and documentation tool, which is not related to collecting data from the local system or network shares.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **C: T1119-Automated Collection**. This technique aligns with the scenario where the backdoor is used to automatically collect sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

**Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection**
