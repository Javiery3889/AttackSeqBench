### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the PRB-Backdoor was stored and executed from a specific directory to maintain long-term presence.
   - The sequence involves executing a macro to decode and run additional encoded PowerShell scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1592.002-Software:** This technique involves using software to gather information, which is not directly related to the execution and persistence of the backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique is relevant because it involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which aligns with the initial step of running the macro to decode and run additional scripts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon, which is a common method for maintaining long-term presence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves using server software to maintain a presence, which is not directly relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with executing a macro to decode and run additional encoded PowerShell scripts (T1059.001-PowerShell and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).
   - After the scripts are executed, the next logical step to maintain long-term presence is to set up a mechanism for the backdoor to execute at system boot or user logon (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
