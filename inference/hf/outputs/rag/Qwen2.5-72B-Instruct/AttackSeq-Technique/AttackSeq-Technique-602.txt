### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Attackers used base64-built files on the host to expose misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access.
     - They then established contact with C2 servers via encoded binaries compiled from decoded snippets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
   - This technique involves adversaries deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable in the context of an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1611-Escape to Host**
     - This technique involves an adversary moving from a container to the host system. While this could be relevant in a Docker context, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of using base64-built files and establishing C2 contact.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain higher privileges. It doesn't align with the sequence of deobfuscating files and establishing C2 contact.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of deobfuscating files and establishing C2 contact.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage. Similar to C, it could be a subsequent step but doesn't directly follow the sequence of deobfuscating files and establishing C2 contact.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves the attackers deobfuscating or decoding the base64-built files to make them usable, which aligns with the related TTP T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information. After deobfuscating, they would use the decoded information to establish contact with C2 servers.
