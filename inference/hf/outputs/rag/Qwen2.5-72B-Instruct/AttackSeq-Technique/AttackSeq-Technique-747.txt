### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to maintain persistent access to the victim’s system after executing a reconnaissance tool and a RAT (Remote Access Tool) retrieved from an external source as binaries.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary:** This technique involves modifying or replacing a legitimate binary with a malicious one to maintain persistence.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services (like RDP, SSH) to maintain access to a system.
   - **T1027.004-Compile After Delivery:** This technique involves compiling code on the victim's system after it has been delivered to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. While it is a valid persistence technique, it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1546.016-Installer Packages**
     - This technique involves using installer packages to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to the given TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to maintain persistence. It is a valid persistence technique but not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted non-C2 protocol. It is not related to maintaining persistence but rather to data exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant TTP from the list is **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**, which is a persistence technique. This technique aligns with the question's context of maintaining persistent access to the victim’s system after executing the reconnaissance tool and RAT.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**

However, based on the related TTPs, the most specific and relevant answer is **T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**. Since this is not one of the answer choices, the closest and most plausible answer is **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**.
