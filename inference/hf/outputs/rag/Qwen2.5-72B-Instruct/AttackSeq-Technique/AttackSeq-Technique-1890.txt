### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands remotely for lateral movement.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves gathering information on network configuration to support the operational objectives of FIN13.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation, which is part of the Execution tactic. This technique involves using WMI to execute commands and scripts on remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves checking for active internet connections. While it can be useful, it is not specifically focused on network configuration.
   - **B: T1505-Server Software Component**
     - This technique involves placing malicious software on a server. It is not related to gathering network configuration information.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering detailed information about the network configuration of a system, which aligns well with the need to gather network configuration information.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access. It is not related to gathering network configuration information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using WMI for lateral movement, the attacker would use T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery to gather information on network configuration.

**Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
