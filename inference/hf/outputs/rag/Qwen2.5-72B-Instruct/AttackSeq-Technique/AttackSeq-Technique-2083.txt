### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where exploits are delivered to victims through malvertising, and users are redirected to exploit kit landing pages.
   - The next step involves RIG EK's infrastructure using an API server through a reverse proxy to Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS) for Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of a proxy to route traffic between the victim and the attacker's command and control (C2) server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a victim's system by having them visit a website that contains malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy:** This technique aligns well with the use of a reverse proxy to route traffic between the victim and the C2 server. The question specifically mentions that RIG EK's infrastructure uses an API server through a reverse proxy to VDS for C2, which is a clear indication of the use of a proxy.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking:** This technique involves manipulating the search order to load a malicious library or executable. It is not directly related to the use of a reverse proxy for C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to signal the presence of a command and control server. While it could be used in conjunction with a proxy, it is not the primary technique described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. While encryption is important for C2, the question specifically mentions the use of a reverse proxy, which is more directly related to T1090-Proxy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the use of a reverse proxy (T1090-Proxy) occurred before the C2 communication was established.

**Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy**
