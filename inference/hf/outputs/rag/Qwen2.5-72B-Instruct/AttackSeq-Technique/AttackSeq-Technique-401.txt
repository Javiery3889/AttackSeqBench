### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a macro is enabled to execute a payload through `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`. After this, the malware initiates SSL communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired digital certificate.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the SSL communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate:** This technique involves installing a digital certificate to establish trust or to enable encrypted communication.
   - **T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the `Rundll32` utility to execute code, often for the purpose of evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. While this is relevant to the SSL communication, it does not specifically address the installation of a digital certificate.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves installing a bootkit, which is a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a system. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from files on the system. This is not directly related to the installation of a digital certificate or the SSL communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade virtualized environments or sandboxes. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate**
     - This technique is directly relevant to the installation of a digital certificate, which is a necessary step before initiating SSL communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the installation of a digital certificate before the SSL communication.

**Final Answer: T1608.003-Install Digital Certificate**
