### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used the Milestone backdoor to create an administrator user for privilege escalation.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves evading detection by hiding malicious artifacts such as files and processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking:** This technique involves preventing or blocking the generation of indicators that would normally be used to detect malicious activity.
   - **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique involves hiding files and directories to prevent detection.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This is a broader technique that encompasses various methods of hiding artifacts, including hidden files and directories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or processes to appear legitimate. While this can help evade detection, it is not specifically about hiding files and directories.
   - **B: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories:** This technique directly aligns with the question's description of hiding malicious artifacts such as files and processes.
   - **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image:** This technique involves using a malicious image to trick a user into executing a payload. It is not relevant to hiding files and directories.
   - **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities:** This technique involves acquiring tools or capabilities to support the attack. It is not related to hiding artifacts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the specific requirement to hide malicious artifacts such as files and processes, the most plausible answer is **B: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**.

Final Answer: B: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories
