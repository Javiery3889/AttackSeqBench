### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Using WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
     - Avoiding PowerShell execution during defense evasion.
     - Sending information about detected antivirus software to a C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:**
     - This technique involves adversaries using various methods to identify security software installed on a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:**
     - This technique involves adversaries exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of C2 communications. While it could be used in a broader attack, it doesn't directly relate to sending information about detected antivirus software.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering system information, which is a broader category and not specific to sending information to a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. This aligns well with the described action of sending information to a C2 server using a web server.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity:**
     - This technique involves using hybrid identity to gain access to resources. It is not relevant to the described action of sending information about detected antivirus software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is directly related to the action of sending information to a C2 server using a web server.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
