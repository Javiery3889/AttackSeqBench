### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Machete group.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Employed self-extracting files for software packing to evade defenses.
     2. Scanned the compromised system for stored browser credentials.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Credential Access
     - Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers
   - This indicates that the focus is on credential access, specifically targeting web browser credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs**
     - This technique involves clearing system logs to cover tracks. It is more related to the post-exploitation phase and does not fit well between software packing and credential scanning.
   - **B: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering information about the browser, which is a logical step before scanning for stored credentials. It fits well in the sequence.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves disguising malicious files or processes. While it can be used to evade detection, it is not directly related to the sequence of credential access.
   - **D: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
     - This technique involves hijacking Terminal Services DLLs, which is not related to the sequence of credential access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. Employed self-extracting files for software packing to evade defenses.
     2. Discovered browser information.
     3. Scanned the compromised system for stored browser credentials.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred between the two steps is **T1217-Browser Information Discovery**.

Final Answer: B: T1217-Browser Information Discovery
