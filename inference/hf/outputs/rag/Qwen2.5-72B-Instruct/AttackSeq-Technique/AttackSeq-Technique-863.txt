### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after GreyEnergy developed modular espionage tools (keylogging and file extraction) and before using infection vectors like spearphishing and compromised web servers for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware:** This technique involves developing or acquiring malware to support operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing with links to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1590.005-IP Addresses:** This technique involves collecting IP addresses, which is not directly related to the development of malware or the initial access methods mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not typically a step between developing malware and gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection, which could be a step after developing malware but before initial access to ensure the malware remains undetected.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization, which is a common step in the resource development phase before developing malware and planning initial access methods.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that GreyEnergy would gather information about the victim organization (T1591) after developing the malware and before using spearphishing or compromised web servers for initial access. This ensures they have the necessary information to tailor their attacks effectively.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information
