### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs in the Regin attack.
   - Specifically, it asks what technique likely occurred after the execution of encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers and before stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes:** This technique involves using NTFS file attributes to hide files or directories.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers:** This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. While this could be part of the attack, it is not specifically related to the sequence described (after EVFS and before credential theft).
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves creating a hidden file system. This is related to defense evasion but does not fit the sequence as well as the other options.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1218.011-Rundll32:** This technique involves using the rundll32 utility to execute code. This could be used to execute payloads, but it does not fit the sequence as well as the other options.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts, which could include using NTFS file attributes (T1564.004) to hide files. This fits well with the sequence described, as it is a defense evasion technique that could be used after setting up the EVFS and before stealing credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurred after the execution of encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers and before stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
