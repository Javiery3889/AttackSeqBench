### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13:
     - Dumped LSASS process memory.
     - Employed network sniffing to obtain credentials.
     - Leveraged native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between the network sniffing and the internal reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is:
     - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves dumping the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
     - This technique involves modifying or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It is not directly related to the sequence of obtaining credentials and internal reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates. While it is related to credential access, it is not a common next step after dumping LSASS memory and network sniffing.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**
     - This technique involves finding and using unsecured credentials. It is a plausible next step after obtaining credentials through LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing, as the attacker might look for additional unsecured credentials to use for further access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering identity information about the victim. While it is related to credential access, it is more about gathering information rather than using the credentials obtained.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurred after dumping LSASS process memory and network sniffing, but before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, is **T1552-Unsecured Credentials**.

**Final Answer: C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**
