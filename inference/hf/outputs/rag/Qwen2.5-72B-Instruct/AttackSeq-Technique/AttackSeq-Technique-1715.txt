### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Mustang Panda uses spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files and the double extension trick for initial access and defense evasion.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated communication with the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension:** This technique involves using a double file extension to trick users into opening malicious files.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a remote system. This is a plausible choice because after gaining initial access, the attacker would need to communicate with the compromised system to exfiltrate data or receive commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications. While this could be used for defense evasion, it is not the primary method for establishing communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1010-Application Window Discovery:** This technique involves discovering open application windows on a system, which is not relevant to establishing communication with a compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is already used for initial access and is not relevant to the communication phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique for facilitating communication with the compromised systems is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
