### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has established persistence by creating a scheduled task and placing malware in a specific directory.
   - The next action involves the malware using its capabilities to take photos from the computer's web camera.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This technique is used to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1125-Video Capture**: This technique involves capturing video or still images from the victim's web camera.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial persistence mechanism. It does not describe the action of taking photos from the web camera.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the victim's internet connection status, which is not related to capturing images from the web camera.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the contents of the victim's screen, not the web camera.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1125-Video Capture**: This technique involves capturing video or still images from the victim's web camera, which aligns with the action described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is the use of T1125-Video Capture to take photos from the web camera.

**Final Answer: D: T1125-Video Capture**
