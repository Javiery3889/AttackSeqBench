### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in an attack:
     - A malicious macro in Operation Sharpshooter injects a downloader into the memory of Word.
     - Rising Sun ensures persistence by placing the second-stage binary into the startup folder.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
   - These TTPs indicate that the final step in the sequence is ensuring persistence by placing the second-stage binary into the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. It is often used for various tasks, including process injection and persistence, but it is not specific to the sequence described.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which is not directly related to the sequence of injecting a downloader and ensuring persistence.
   - **C: T1059.001-PowerShell**
     - This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is commonly used in post-exploitation activities, including downloading and executing additional payloads, which fits well between the injection of the downloader and the placement of the second-stage binary.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems, which is not directly related to the sequence described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. A malicious macro injects a downloader into the memory of Word.
     2. The downloader uses PowerShell to execute additional commands and download the second-stage binary.
     3. The second-stage binary is placed into the startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred between the injection of the downloader and the placement of the second-stage binary is **T1059.001-PowerShell**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1059.001-PowerShell
