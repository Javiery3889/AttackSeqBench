### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Shellbot discovered monitoring tools and host information but before establishing persistent communication with the C&C servers via IRC.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like IRC) to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes on a system, which can help in discovering monitoring tools and host information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying installed software on a system. While this could be part of the discovery phase, it is not specifically about discovering running processes or monitoring tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities on the target system. This is more relevant to the initial stages of an attack, not the phase after discovering monitoring tools and host information.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and open ports on the target system. This could be relevant to the discovery phase but is not specifically about discovering running processes or monitoring tools.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase, not the discovery phase.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after discovering monitoring tools and host information (which aligns with T1057-Process Discovery), the next step would be to establish persistent communication with the C&C server via IRC (T1071-Application Layer Protocol).
   - Among the given choices, **T1046-Network Service Discovery** is the most relevant to the discovery phase and fits the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery
