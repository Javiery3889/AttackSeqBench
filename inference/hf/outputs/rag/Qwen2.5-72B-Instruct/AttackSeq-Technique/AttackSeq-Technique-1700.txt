### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has performed lateral movement by connecting to V2's SMB service from V1 to perform sensitive operations.
   - After this, Bvp47 (likely a malware or tool) established covert communication with a command server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system.
   - **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1572 - Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls. This could be used to establish covert communication with a command server.
   - **B: T1548 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. This is not directly related to establishing covert communication with a command server.
   - **C: T1205 - Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate network protocols to signal or communicate with a command server. This could be used to establish covert communication.
   - **D: T1557.002 - ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. This is more about network manipulation and not directly about establishing covert communication with a command server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **T1572 - Protocol Tunneling** and **T1205 - Traffic Signaling** are the most relevant techniques for establishing covert communication with a command server.
   - **T1572 - Protocol Tunneling** is more specific to the scenario of encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass security controls, which is a common method for establishing covert communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
