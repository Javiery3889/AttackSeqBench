### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a renamed `rundll32.exe` (now called `ActiveFlash.exe`) is used to perform malicious actions.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to ensure the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**
     - This technique involves using the legitimate `rundll32.exe` to execute malicious code, which is consistent with the scenario of renaming `rundll32.exe` to `ActiveFlash.exe`.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is also about ensuring the malware runs automatically during system boot or user logon, which aligns with the question's requirement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate programs to run malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not specifically about ensuring automatic startup during boot or logon.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1546.002-Screensaver**
     - This technique involves using the screensaver mechanism to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to ensuring automatic startup during boot or logon.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This is the same as Answer Choice A and is not the most relevant for the given scenario.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is directly related to ensuring that the malware runs automatically during system boot or user logon, which is exactly what the question is asking about.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
