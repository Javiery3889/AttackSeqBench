### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the CopyKittens attack group used a global mutex and runtime API address resolution to prevent detection in their multi-stage infection framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1106-Native API (Tactic: Execution):** This technique involves directly invoking native APIs to execute code or perform actions.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (Tactic: Command and Control):** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to control the compromised system.
   - **T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution (Tactic: Defense Evasion):** This technique involves dynamically resolving API addresses at runtime to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070.007-Clear Network Connection History and Configurations**
     - This technique is related to clearing network connection history and configurations, which is more about post-exploitation activities to cover tracks. It does not align well with the context of preventing detection during the initial stages of the infection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection. While it is a defense evasion technique, it is not specifically related to the use of global mutexes or dynamic API resolution.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.012-Print Processors**
     - This technique involves modifying print processors to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to the context of preventing detection during the initial stages of the infection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading debuggers, which is a common method to prevent detection and analysis of malware. Given that the CopyKittens group is using techniques like global mutexes and dynamic API resolution to prevent detection, it is plausible that they would also use debugger evasion to further evade analysis.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the CopyKittens group would use debugger evasion (T1622) after employing global mutexes and dynamic API resolution to prevent detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
