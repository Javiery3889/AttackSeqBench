### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where SparrowDoor gathers system information (usernames, RDP session IDs, and file attributes) during the Discovery phase.
   - After this, data is exfiltrated over the C2 (Command and Control) channel using SparrowDoor.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two stages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Exfiltration tactic is involved, specifically the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - This confirms that the final stage of the attack sequence involves exfiltration over the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking a user's browser session to gain access to their web activities. It is not typically used for gathering system information or preparing for exfiltration.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns well with the stage where SparrowDoor gathers system information. It is a logical step before exfiltration.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it could be used in the attack, it is not a necessary step between gathering system information and exfiltration.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - This technique is specific to exploiting Confluence, a collaboration software, and is not relevant to the described attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after SparrowDoor gathers system information, it collects data from the local system (T1005) before exfiltrating it over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System**
