### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group's malware:
     - Scanning for files matching specific extensions.
     - Staging data containing paths of files to exfiltrate.
     - Sending the data to the C&C server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between the staging of data and the exfiltration to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:**
     - This technique involves collecting and staging data on a remote system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves sending the collected data to a C2 (Command and Control) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is not directly related to the staging or exfiltration of files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals, which is also not directly related to the staging or exfiltration of files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which could be relevant but is not typically performed between staging and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**
     - This technique involves techniques to bridge network boundaries, which is not directly related to the staging or exfiltration of files.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging** (staging data containing paths of files to exfiltrate).
     - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** (sending the data to the C&C server).
   - The technique that fits between these two is not explicitly listed in the answer choices, but the closest and most relevant technique is **T1070-Indicator Removal**. This is because it is a common step to remove traces of the staging and exfiltration to avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal
