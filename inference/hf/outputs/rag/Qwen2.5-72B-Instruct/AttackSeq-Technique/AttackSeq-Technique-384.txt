### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where a new service was created for persistence, and then file and directory listings were obtained for discovery.
   - We need to determine which technique likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries obtaining file and directory listings to gather information about the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is typically used to reveal hidden or encoded data. This is not directly related to the sequence of creating a service and then discovering files and directories.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves adversaries using system services to execute their own code. While it is related to services, it is more about executing code rather than the sequence of creating a service and then discovering files.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller:** This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to gain control over a network. This is not relevant to the sequence of creating a service and then discovering files.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1003.001-LSASS Memory:** This technique involves accessing the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to obtain credentials. This is a post-exploitation technique and is not directly related to the sequence of creating a service and then discovering files.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after creating a new service for persistence (T1543.003), the adversary would likely perform some form of discovery to understand the environment better before proceeding with further actions.
   - Among the given choices, none directly fit the sequence perfectly, but the closest and most logical step would be to perform some form of discovery, which is not explicitly listed in the choices. However, if we must choose from the given options, the least relevant and most plausible in a broader context is **T1569-System Services**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1569-System Services

However, it's important to note that the most logical step would be a discovery technique, but since it's not listed, T1569 is the closest in the context of system manipulation.
