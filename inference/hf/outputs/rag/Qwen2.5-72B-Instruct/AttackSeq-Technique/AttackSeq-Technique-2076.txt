### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the threat actor, Whitefly, has already compromised additional machines using stolen credentials. The next step in the attack sequence is to map the network and identify further systems for infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves the adversary discovering information about remote systems, such as network topology, to identify potential targets for further compromise.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves collecting credentials for use in future attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial data, which is not relevant to the discovery and mapping of the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is more specific to cloud environments and not directly related to network mapping.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns perfectly with the need to map the network and identify further systems for infection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is typically done earlier in the attack sequence to gain initial access or to escalate privileges, not after the initial compromise and before network mapping.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after using stolen credentials to compromise additional machines, the next step is to map the network and identify further systems for infection using **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
