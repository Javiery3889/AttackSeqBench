### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before the attacker connected to the C2 server using the CARBANAK RAT and executed additional payloads through reflection methods to establish backdoor access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain command and control (C2) over a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically related to the sequence of connecting to a C2 server and executing payloads.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI:** This technique involves using the command-line interface of network devices. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While this can be used to evade detection, it is not a prerequisite for connecting to a C2 server and executing payloads.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. This is not directly related to the sequence of connecting to a C2 server and executing payloads.

4. **Evaluate the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves connecting to a C2 server and executing additional payloads. The most relevant technique from the related TTPs is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**. This technique is used to transfer tools or other files into the compromised environment, which is a necessary step before the attacker can connect to the C2 server and execute additional payloads.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
