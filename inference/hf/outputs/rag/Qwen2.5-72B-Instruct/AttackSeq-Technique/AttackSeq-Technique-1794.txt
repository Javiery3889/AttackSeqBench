### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where OceanLotus gains initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious macros.
   - The focus is on the reconnaissance phase, specifically targeting top-level management for information gathering.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending emails to victims to gain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This sub-technique involves sending emails with attachments that contain malicious content, such as macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**

   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is a broader technique that includes various forms of phishing, including spear-phishing. While it is relevant to the initial access, it does not specifically focus on the reconnaissance phase.
   - **C: T1596.004-CDNs**: This sub-technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host malicious content. It is not directly related to the reconnaissance phase or information gathering.
   - **D: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This sub-technique involves using legitimate Windows utilities to execute malicious code. It is not related to the reconnaissance phase or information gathering.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the reconnaissance phase and the targeting of top-level management for information gathering, is **T1598-Phishing for Information**.

**Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
