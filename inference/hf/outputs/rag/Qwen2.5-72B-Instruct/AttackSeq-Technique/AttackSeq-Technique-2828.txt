### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has used file transfers and executed arbitrary commands for data gathering. The next step in the sequence is to enable communication with C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves setting up a schedule to transfer data at specific times.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is a communication channel used by the attacker to control the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is not relevant to the communication with C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with C2 infrastructure. Cloudflare Workers is a web service, making this a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547.008-LSASS Driver:** This technique involves persistence through the LSASS driver, which is not relevant to communication with C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which is less likely to be used with a web service like Cloudflare Workers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is **B: T1102-Web Service**. This technique aligns with the use of Cloudflare Workers, which is a web service, to enable communication with C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
