### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the implant reduced forensic artifacts by deleting the dropper binary and before it started stealing data using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTP is T1070.004-File Deletion, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic. This technique involves deleting files to reduce forensic artifacts, which aligns with the first part of the question where the dropper binary is deleted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** This technique involves using IPC mechanisms to communicate between processes. While it could be used in the context of an attack, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described (file deletion and data theft).
   - **B: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH for remote access. It is not relevant to the sequence of events described, which involves file deletion and data theft.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it could be used to hide the dropper binary or other malicious files, it does not fit the sequence of events where the dropper binary is deleted and data theft follows.
   - **D: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations:** This technique involves modifying cloud compute configurations, which is not relevant to the sequence of events described, which are focused on local file deletion and data theft.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the dropper binary is deleted (T1070.004-File Deletion), the next step is to steal data using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module. The technique that fits best between these two events is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information. This is because the implant might obfuscate its presence or the data it is stealing to avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
