### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious Excel file prompts the victim to enable macros, which then executes a payload using ShellExecute under cmd.exe and Rundll32.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware established mechanisms to hide from debuggers such as Ollydbg and IDA.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the initial step of the victim enabling macros in the Excel file.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection:** This technique involves using Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to inject code into legitimate processes, which can be used for persistence and evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into opening attachments or clicking links. While this could be the initial vector for delivering the malicious Excel file, it is not the most immediate step after the user enables macros.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller:** This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to capture credentials. This is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique involves techniques to detect and evade debuggers, which is mentioned in the question as occurring after the payload execution. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves identifying the system owner and user information, which can be useful for the malware to understand the environment it is running in. This is a plausible step that could occur before the malware attempts to hide from debuggers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before the malware established mechanisms to hide from debuggers is **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
