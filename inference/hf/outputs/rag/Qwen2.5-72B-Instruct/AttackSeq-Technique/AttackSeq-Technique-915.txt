### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems using functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl.'
   - The focus is on gaining initial access to the vulnerable systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell:** This technique involves using Unix shell commands to execute code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This technique involves using Windows command shell to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
     - This is a plausible initial access method that could lead to the execution of commands using shell or perl.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a system.
     - While this could be a method for lateral movement, it is less likely to be the initial access method compared to exploiting a public-facing application.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call:**
     - This technique involves using asynchronous procedure calls to execute code in the context of another process.
     - This is more of a post-exploitation technique and is less likely to be the initial access method.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute code.
     - While this is related to the execution of commands, it is not an initial access method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible initial access method is exploiting a public-facing application.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
