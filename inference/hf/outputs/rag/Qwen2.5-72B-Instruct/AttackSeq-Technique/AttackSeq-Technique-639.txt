### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker evades detection by checking CPU cores and using large null-padded files. The next step involves network communication using hardcoded header values and encrypted data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption or encoding to obfuscate files or information.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to make them usable.
   - **T1027.001-Binary Padding:** This technique involves adding null bytes or other padding to files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up programs to automatically execute at boot or logon. It does not align with the described network communication using hardcoded headers and encrypted data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols for communication. While it involves network communication, it is specific to email and does not align with the use of hardcoded headers and encrypted data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. It aligns well with the described network communication using hardcoded headers and encrypted data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**
     - This technique involves using network logon scripts to execute commands. It does not align with the described network communication using hardcoded headers and encrypted data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using application layer protocols for network communication with hardcoded headers and encrypted data.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
