### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the injection of encrypted shellcode (MpSvc.dll) into processes and before the use of a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is not directly related to the sequence of injecting shellcode and then using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1612-Build Image on Host**
     - This technique involves building an image on the host, which is not relevant to the sequence of injecting shellcode and then using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the sequence of injecting shellcode and then using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into processes, which aligns with the sequence described in the question. The injection of MpSvc.dll into processes is a form of process injection, and it is likely that additional process injection techniques were used to maintain persistence or further the attack before using Mimikatz to dump credentials.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is **T1055-Process Injection**.

**Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection**
