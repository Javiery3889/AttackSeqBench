### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by ProjectM, starting with reconnaissance and then targeting Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites.
   - The focus is on what ProjectM did after these initial actions to develop its capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious content.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link:** This technique is similar to T1566.002 and involves using spear-phishing links for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1543.005-Container Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying container services to maintain persistence. This does not align with the development of capabilities after initial access.
   - **B: T1584.008-Network Devices:** This technique involves targeting network devices to gain access or control. This is not directly related to developing capabilities.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing or enhancing capabilities, which aligns with the question's focus on what ProjectM did after initial access to develop its capabilities.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's identity, which is more related to reconnaissance and initial access rather than developing capabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that ProjectM developed its capabilities after conducting reconnaissance and initial access.

**Final Answer: C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
