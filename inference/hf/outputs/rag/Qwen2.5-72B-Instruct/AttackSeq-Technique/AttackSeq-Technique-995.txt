### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery, but before data exfiltration using the SmartFTP Client during the Collection stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves moving data to a central location or a remote system before exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions or configurations. It is not directly related to network reconnaissance or data discovery.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network topology. This is a logical step after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - **C: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically tied to the sequence of network reconnaissance and data discovery.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence of events is:
     1. Deploy Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery.
     2. Conduct remote system discovery to identify potential targets and data sources.
     3. Stage the data remotely (T1074.002-Remote Data Staging).
     4. Exfiltrate the data using the SmartFTP Client over a C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery
