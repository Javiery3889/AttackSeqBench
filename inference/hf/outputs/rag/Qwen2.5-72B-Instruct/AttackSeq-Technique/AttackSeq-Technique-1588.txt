### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious actor uses DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe` to execute malicious functionality.
   - After this, the actor customizes the installation to evade 24 identified security products.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery (Tactic: Discovery):** This technique involves the adversary discovering security software installed on the system.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Tactic: Defense Evasion):** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. While it is related to loading modules, it does not specifically address the evasion of security products.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This could be relevant to evading security products, but it is not the most direct technique for customizing installation to evade specific products.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automatically collecting information from the system. It is more related to the discovery phase rather than evasion.
   - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. While it is a form of evasion, it is not directly related to customizing the installation to evade specific security products.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence would be:
     1. **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** The attacker uses DLL sideloading to execute malicious code.
     2. **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** The attacker discovers the security software installed on the system.
     3. **Customization to Evade Security Products:** The attacker then customizes the installation to evade the identified security products.

   - Among the given choices, **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts** is the most plausible technique that would occur after the DLL sideloading and before the customization to evade security products. Hiding artifacts is a common step to avoid detection by security products.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts
