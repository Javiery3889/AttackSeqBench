### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Pierogi backdoor has gathered system information.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred before establishing command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the backdoor gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves the use of multiple stages to establish and maintain communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's system. While it can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not typically a prerequisite for establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the automated collection of data from the victim's system. While it can be part of the discovery phase, it is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. This can be a prerequisite for initial access but is not typically a step taken after system information discovery and before C2 communication.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with the C2 server. This is a plausible step that occurs after system information discovery and before establishing C2 communication, as it involves setting up the communication channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurs after system information discovery and before establishing C2 communication is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
