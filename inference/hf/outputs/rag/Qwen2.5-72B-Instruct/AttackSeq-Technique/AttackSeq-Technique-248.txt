### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that likely occurred before the attackers used CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to download additional payloads.
   - The key points are:
     - The attackers used CertUtil.exe.
     - The executable was disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
     - The purpose was to download additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**
     - This technique involves naming or placing files in a way that mimics legitimate system or application files.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves renaming or masquerading files to appear as legitimate system or application files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
     - While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the masquerading of the executable.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique directly aligns with the attackers renaming or disguising the executable as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
     - It is a key step in the attack sequence before using CertUtil.exe to download additional payloads.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence on a host.
     - While this could be used to cover tracks, it does not directly relate to the initial masquerading of the executable.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting a user's SID history to gain additional privileges.
     - This is not directly related to the masquerading of the executable.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first used T1036-Masquerading to disguise the executable as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' before using CertUtil.exe to download additional payloads.

**Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading**
