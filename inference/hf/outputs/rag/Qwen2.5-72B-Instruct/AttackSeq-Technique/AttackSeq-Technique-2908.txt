### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated remote access to the network before APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication over DNS.
   - The focus is on the initial access and the method used to gain and maintain remote access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**
   - **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS for command and control (C2) communication, which aligns with the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
     - This technique involves using local accounts on a system to gain access. While it can be used for initial access, it is less likely to be the primary method for remote access, especially in the context of APT15's sophisticated operations.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to gain access to a network. This is a plausible method for initial access and can be used to establish a foothold before deploying a backdoor.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid accounts (e.g., stolen credentials) to gain access. This is a common and effective method for initial access and can be used to establish a foothold before deploying a backdoor.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access. While it is a valid method, it is less likely in the context of APT15's operations, which typically focus on traditional network infiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services** and **C: T1078-Valid Accounts** are the most plausible choices.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts** is more likely because it is a common and effective method for initial access, and APT15 is known for using stolen credentials to gain and maintain access to networks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts
