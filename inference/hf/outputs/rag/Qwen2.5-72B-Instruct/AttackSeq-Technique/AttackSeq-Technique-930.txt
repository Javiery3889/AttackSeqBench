### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where keylogging is used to gain administrator passwords, followed by the use of writable mass storage devices (USBs) for infection to spread across the network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the USB infection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to spread malware across a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique can also be used for initial access to a network.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves using USB drives to exfiltrate data from a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions, which is not directly related to the use of removable media or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is not directly related to the use of removable media or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1216.001-PubPrn:** This technique involves using a malicious printer driver, which is not directly related to the use of removable media or lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access or move laterally within a network. This is a plausible step before using removable media for lateral movement, as it can provide the initial access or foothold needed to deploy the USB infection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first exploited remote services to gain access or move laterally within the network, and then used removable media (USBs) to spread the infection.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
