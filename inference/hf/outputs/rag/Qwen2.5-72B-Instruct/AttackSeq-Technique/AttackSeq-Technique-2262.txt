### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a batch file is executed, which downloads and runs a PowerShell script at the memory level. After this, persistence is achieved through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the persistence was achieved.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the attacker used scheduled tasks to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the scheduled task was also used for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While phishing could be the initial vector for the batch file, it is not the most likely technique that occurred immediately before the persistence through scheduled tasks.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**: Socket filters are used to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This technique is not directly related to the execution of a batch file or the establishment of persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**: This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools to introduce malicious code. While this could be a method to deliver the batch file, it is not the most likely technique that occurred immediately before the persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This could be used to download the PowerShell script, but it is not the most likely technique that occurred immediately before the persistence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the batch file was executed, which downloaded and ran a PowerShell script. This script likely used an application layer protocol (T1071) to communicate with a C2 server to download the necessary components. After the script was executed, the attacker then set up persistence through scheduled tasks (T1053.005).

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
