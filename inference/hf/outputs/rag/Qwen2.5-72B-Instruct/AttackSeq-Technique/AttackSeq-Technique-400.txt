### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious PE file is created and executed using concatenated ASCII character codes in a function. The focus is on the technique used to hide the malware's activities from debuggers and sandboxes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.001-Binary Padding:** This technique involves adding unnecessary data to a file to make it more difficult to analyze or detect.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves altering the appearance of code or data to make it harder to understand or detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique aligns well with the scenario described. Obfuscation is a common method used to hide the true nature of a file or code, making it harder for debuggers and sandboxes to detect and analyze the malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. It does not directly relate to hiding the malware from analysis.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
     - This technique involves storing data in a resource fork, which is a feature specific to macOS. It is not relevant to the scenario described, which involves a PE file (a Windows executable).
   - **Answer Choice D: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying a container to run malicious code. It does not directly relate to hiding the malware from analysis.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**. This technique is directly related to the described scenario of hiding the malware's activities from debuggers and sandboxes.

**Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
