### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where FoggyWeb evaded detection by leveraging CLR hosting interfaces and APIs to load the backdoor within the same Application Domain as legitimate AD FS managed code.
   - After evading detection, it exfiltrated the configuration database and certificates from the compromised AD FS servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves naming or placing malicious files or directories in a way that they appear legitimate to users and security tools.
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves directly calling lower-level system functions (APIs) to perform actions that are typically done through higher-level system interfaces.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading:** This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, often by manipulating the search order or by placing the malicious DLL in a specific directory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification:** This technique involves changing the code signing policy to allow unsigned or improperly signed code to run. This is not directly related to the evasion or exfiltration described.
   - **T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port on a target system. This is not relevant to the described sequence of events.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is the final step in the sequence, not the step that occurs after evasion and before exfiltration.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. This could be a plausible step between evasion and exfiltration, as it might be used to establish a communication channel for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described, the most plausible technique that occurred after evasion and before exfiltration is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique would be used to establish a communication channel that the backdoor can use to exfiltrate the data.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
