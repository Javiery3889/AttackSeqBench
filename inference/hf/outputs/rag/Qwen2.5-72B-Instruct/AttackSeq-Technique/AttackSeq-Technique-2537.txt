### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained using fake Japanese documents.
   - The next step in the sequence is the retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the initial access using fake Japanese documents.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to retrieve C&C information from web services, which aligns with the retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which could be relevant to the retrieval and use of the encrypted C&C configuration information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions before executing the payload. It does not align well with the sequence described, as it is more about pre-execution checks rather than the retrieval of C&C information.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the retrieval of C&C information.
   - **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts to gain access or maintain persistence. It does not align with the retrieval of C&C information.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with C&C servers. It aligns well with the retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access using fake Japanese documents, the malware would use a web service to retrieve the encrypted C&C configuration information.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
