### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker injects hidden DLLs into `iexplore.exe` to provide loading and anti-analysis functionalities.
   - The next step in the sequence is to maintain persistence by modifying registry keys under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is **Persistence** and the technique is **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**.
   - This technique involves modifying the registry keys to ensure that a malicious program runs automatically when the user logs in.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it might be used in the initial stages of the attack, it does not directly relate to maintaining persistence through registry keys.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1218.004-InstallUtil**
     - This technique involves using the .NET Framework's `InstallUtil` utility to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to maintaining persistence through registry keys.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures**
     - This technique involves using SQL stored procedures to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to maintaining persistence through registry keys.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that a program runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. The specific sub-technique **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** is mentioned in the related TTPs, which directly aligns with the question's description of modifying registry keys under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
