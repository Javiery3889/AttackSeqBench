### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was achieved using macro-enabled template files with remote template injection.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker disrupted analysis efforts by using RC4-encrypted strings that required an HTTP GET request for decryption.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1221-Template Injection:** This technique involves using a remote template to inject malicious code into a document, which is consistent with the initial access method described.
   - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encryption to obfuscate files or information, which aligns with the use of RC4-encrypted strings.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is relevant to the decryption of the RC4-encrypted strings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1112-Modify Registry:** This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to achieve persistence or other objectives. While it is a common technique, it does not directly relate to the encryption and decryption of files.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which is consistent with the use of RC4-encrypted strings.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms to gain higher privileges. It does not directly relate to the encryption and decryption of files.
   - **D: T1137-Office Application Startup:** This technique involves using Office application startup to achieve persistence. It does not directly relate to the encryption and decryption of files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** to encrypt the strings, which were then decrypted using an HTTP GET request.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
