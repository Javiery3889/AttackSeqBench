### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely enabled the capture of webcam images as part of the Adwind RAT's core functionality.
   - The sequence of events is: multi-layer obfuscation -> capture of webcam images -> connection to the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique involves capturing video or still images from a webcam.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to establish and maintain a C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it occurs after the webcam images are captured and is not the technique that enables the capture itself.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique directly involves capturing video or still images from a webcam, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1608.002-Upload Tool:** This technique involves uploading tools to the victim's system. While this could be part of the initial infection or setup, it does not directly enable the capture of webcam images.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1213.002-Sharepoint:** This technique involves using Sharepoint for data exfiltration or command and control. It is not relevant to capturing webcam images.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Adwind RAT used T1125-Video Capture to capture webcam images before attempting to connect to its C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: T1125-Video Capture**
