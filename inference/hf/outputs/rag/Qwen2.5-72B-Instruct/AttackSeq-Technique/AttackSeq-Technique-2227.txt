### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Earth Lusca.
   - They used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan to scan for NetBIOS name information and shared folders during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK technique likely occurred after this Discovery phase and before Lateral Movement.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active systems on a network, which is a common step in the Discovery phase.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their versions, which is also a common step in the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate programs to execute malicious code. This is more relevant to the Execution or Persistence phases, not the Discovery phase.
   - **B: T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their versions, which aligns well with the Discovery phase and the use of tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying installed software on a system, which is also a Discovery phase technique but is more focused on software rather than network services.
   - **D: T1036.007-Double File Extension:** This technique involves using file extensions to disguise malicious files, which is more relevant to the Defense Evasion phase, not the Discovery phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after scanning for NetBIOS name information and shared folders, the threat actor would likely perform Network Service Discovery to identify network services and their versions before proceeding to Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: B: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
