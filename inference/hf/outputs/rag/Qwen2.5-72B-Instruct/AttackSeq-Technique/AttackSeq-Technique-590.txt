### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, the attackers created public registry accounts that mimicked popular software or packages to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which aligns with the initial exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **T1612-Build Image on Host:** This technique involves building a malicious image on the host, which could be part of the process of creating and deploying malicious container images.
   - **T1204.003-Malicious Image:** This technique involves using a malicious image to execute code, which aligns with the attackers tricking developers into running malicious container images.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access, which does not fit the scenario of exploiting Docker API ports and tricking developers with malicious container images.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising the supply chain to deliver malicious software, which aligns with the attackers creating public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to host or deliver malicious content, which is not directly relevant to the scenario of exploiting Docker API ports and tricking developers with malicious container images.
   - **D: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing, which is not relevant to the scenario of exploiting Docker API ports and tricking developers with malicious container images.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack scenario described is **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**. This technique aligns with the attackers creating public registry accounts to mimic popular software or packages and trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.

**Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
