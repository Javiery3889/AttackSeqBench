### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro is delivered.
   - After the macro is executed, the `mshta.exe` tool is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the use of `mshta.exe`.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic is "Execution" and the Technique is "T1059.005-Visual Basic."
   - This suggests that the VBA macro is a key part of the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into opening malicious documents or clicking on malicious links. While this could be the initial vector for delivering the PowerPoint add-in, it is not the technique that directly leads to the execution of the VBA macro.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute code. The VBA macro in the PowerPoint add-in is a form of scripting, and it is used to execute the `mshta.exe` command.
   - **C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL. This is not relevant to the execution of a VBA macro or the use of `mshta.exe`.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This is the same as option B, which is relevant because the VBA macro is a scripting interpreter.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The VBA macro in the PowerPoint add-in is a form of scripting, and it is used to execute the `mshta.exe` command to download and execute the dropper.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before the use of `mshta.exe` is the execution of the VBA macro, which falls under the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
