### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred before ChChes established communication with its C&C servers using encrypted HTTP requests.
   - The focus is on the sequence of events leading up to the command and control (C&C) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for C&C communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection during C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions through deceptive emails or messages. Phishing is often used as an initial access vector.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C&C communications. However, this is more about the communication itself rather than the initial access.
   - **C: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This is a specific type of phishing that targets specific individuals or organizations using services like social media or messaging platforms. It is also an initial access vector.
   - **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection:** This technique involves manipulating the Security Identifier (SID) history to gain elevated privileges. It is not typically used for initial access or C&C communication.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question is asking about the technique that likely occurred before the C&C communication. Given the context, the initial access vector is the most relevant.
   - **Phishing** (T1566) and **Spearphishing via Service** (T1566.003) are both initial access techniques.
   - **Spearphishing via Service** (T1566.003) is more specific and targeted, making it a more plausible choice for a sophisticated attack like ChChes.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
