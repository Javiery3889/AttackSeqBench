### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Elirks malware is used to establish contact with a C2 server by accessing pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services.
   - The initial access is achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to maintain access. It is not typically used immediately after initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1087.003-Email Account**
     - This technique involves gathering information from email accounts. While it could be used after initial access, it is not the most likely next step after establishing C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C2 server. Given that Elirks malware uses pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
     - This technique involves using domain generation algorithms to generate a large number of domain names for C2 communication. While it is related to C2 communication, it is not typically used in the context of pre-determined encoded addresses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after initial access via spear-phishing, the malware uses web services to communicate with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
