### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred prior to establishing command and control using a backdoor with overlapping features with Kazuar, in the context of the SolarWinds incident.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to maintain command and control.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials:** This technique involves gathering credentials for future use.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access to a target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. While this is a common technique for maintaining command and control, it is not typically the initial access method.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access. While this is a common initial access method, it is not the primary method used in the SolarWinds incident.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access. This is the primary method used in the SolarWinds incident, where the attackers compromised the SolarWinds software update process to distribute malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers:** This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. While this can be used for persistence, it is not typically the initial access method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context of the SolarWinds incident and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the supply chain compromise (T1195.002) occurred prior to establishing command and control using a backdoor with overlapping features with Kazuar.

**Final Answer: C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
