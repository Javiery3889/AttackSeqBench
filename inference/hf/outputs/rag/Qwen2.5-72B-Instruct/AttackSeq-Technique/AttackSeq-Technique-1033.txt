### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Kingslayer backdoor is loaded via a malicious 'Alpha' software subversion.
   - The backdoor then evades detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
   - Both TTPs refer to the same technique: **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**.
   - This technique involves scheduling or timing the execution of malicious activities to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves using remote access tools to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system.
     - While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the evasion technique described.
   - **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to gain unauthorized access.
     - This is more related to initial access or privilege escalation, not evasion.
   - **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
     - This technique involves changing the code of malware to avoid detection by signature-based defenses.
     - While this is a form of evasion, it is not specifically related to time-based evasion.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence.
     - This is more related to initial access or persistence, not evasion.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the question is **T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm, which is a form of time-based evasion.
   - None of the answer choices directly list T1497.003, but we need to choose the one that best aligns with the context of time-based evasion.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is:

**Final Answer: C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**

While T1027.014-Polymorphic Code is not a perfect match, it is the closest in the context of evasion techniques. However, if the question specifically requires a technique that directly involves time-based evasion, the answer choices provided may not fully capture the exact technique described.
