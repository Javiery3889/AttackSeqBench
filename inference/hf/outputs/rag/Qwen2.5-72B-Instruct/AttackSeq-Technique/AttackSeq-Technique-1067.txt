### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers used watering hole tactics to gain initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in Chrome and Internet Explorer.
   - After gaining initial access, they leveraged a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458) using a PowerShell loader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher-level privileges on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is typically used for data collection and not for gaining initial access or privilege escalation.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands on a system. This is a common step after gaining initial access and before privilege escalation, as it allows the attacker to run commands and scripts to further their attack.
   - **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image:** This technique involves using a malicious image to trick a user into executing a payload. This is more relevant to initial access but not specifically to the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data, which is typically used to evade detection and not for gaining initial access or privilege escalation.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through the watering hole attack and exploiting vulnerabilities in Chrome and Internet Explorer, the attackers would use a command and scripting interpreter (PowerShell) to execute commands and scripts necessary to leverage the privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
