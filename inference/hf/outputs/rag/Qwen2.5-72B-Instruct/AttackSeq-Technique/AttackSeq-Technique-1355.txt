### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through spearphishing with macro-enabled Microsoft Office documents and watering hole attacks.
   - The next step in the sequence involves downloading and executing poisoned installers via PowerShell scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which aligns with the spearphishing attachment.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts, which aligns with the execution of poisoned installers.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments, which aligns with the initial access method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the initial access method.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands, which aligns with the use of PowerShell to execute poisoned installers.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **D: T1480.001-Environmental Keying:** This technique involves ensuring that malware only runs in a specific environment, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the initial access method.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of PowerShell to execute the poisoned installers. This aligns with the related TTPs and the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
