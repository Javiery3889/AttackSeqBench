### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon has already compromised a system and injected malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves sending emails with these malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is "Initial Access" and the technique is "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments to trick users into opening them, which can lead to further compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1546.002-Screensaver**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows screensaver to execute malicious code. It does not fit the context of sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, which is a part of the attack but not the specific step of sending the emails.
   - **C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement, which is not relevant to sending emails with attachments.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails to internal targets within the same organization, which aligns perfectly with the described scenario.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is "T1534-Internal Spearphishing."

**Final Answer: D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
