### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the PlugX RAT is implanted through spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word attachments.
   - The next step in the sequence is achieving persistence using Service + Run Key.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the initial access phase where the user opens the exploit-laden Microsoft Word attachment.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique is used to achieve persistence by adding a registry run key or placing a file in the startup folder, which aligns with the persistence phase mentioned in the question.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, which is the initial access method described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared modules to load malicious code, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job:** This technique involves scheduling tasks in container orchestration systems, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at boot or logon, which aligns with the persistence phase described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is achieving persistence using a technique that sets up autostart execution at boot or logon.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
