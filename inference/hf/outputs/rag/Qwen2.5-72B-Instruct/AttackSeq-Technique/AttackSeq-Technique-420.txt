### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where adversaries exploited MEGA cloud service and an unprotected MongoDB database to gain initial access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before these initial access methods to support their operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access.
   - **T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts in cloud services to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves hiding the nature of malicious files or information. While it can be used to evade detection, it is not typically a precursor to gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which can be useful for planning and executing an attack. This is a common preparatory step before attempting to gain initial access.
   - **C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:** This technique involves obtaining or creating authentication certificates, which can be used to gain access to systems. However, it is more commonly used after initial access has been gained.
   - **D: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information:** This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host systems, which can also be useful for planning and executing an attack. This is another common preparatory step before attempting to gain initial access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Both **B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** and **D: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information** are plausible as preparatory steps before gaining initial access.
   - However, **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** is more broadly applicable and can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the victim's environment, which is crucial for identifying and exploiting public-facing applications and cloud services.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
