### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Agrius group:
     - Exploited FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 to upload webshells.
     - Achieved lateral movement.
     - Registered the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions:**
     - This technique involves manipulating file or path exclusions to avoid detection by security software. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the compromised system. While it could be used for command and control, it is not directly related to the persistence mechanism described.
   - **C: T1059.008-Network Device CLI:**
     - This technique involves using the command-line interface of a network device. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **D: T1569-System Services:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to achieve persistence. This aligns with the described action of registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the creation or modification of a system service to achieve persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services**
