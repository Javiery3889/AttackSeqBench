### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used by FIN4 to facilitate anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after stealing credentials through spearphishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves using spearphishing emails with links to gain initial access to a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's identity, which is not directly related to C2 communication or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1590.002-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication, but it is not specifically mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route C2 traffic, which can help in maintaining anonymity.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port, which is not typically used for maintaining C2 communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining anonymous communication with C2 infrastructure, given the context of using web protocols for C2 communication, is **T1090-Proxy**. Proxies can be used to route traffic through intermediate servers, making it harder to trace the communication back to the attacker.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy
