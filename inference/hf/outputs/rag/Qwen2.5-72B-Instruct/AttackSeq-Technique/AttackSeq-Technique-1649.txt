### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the PurpleFox malware:
     - Evaded detection using an MSI package.
     - Installed a rootkit driver.
     - Blocked incoming connections via a firewall rule.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall:**
     - This technique involves modifying or disabling the system firewall to allow the malware to operate without being detected or blocked.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves establishing a communication channel that allows the malware to send data to and receive commands from the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service:**
     - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the C&C server. However, it does not specifically mention bidirectional communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205-Traffic Signaling:**
     - This technique involves using network traffic to signal the C&C server, but it does not establish a bidirectional communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication methods if the primary C&C channel is disrupted. It does not specifically mention establishing a bidirectional communication channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1014-Rootkit:**
     - This technique involves using a rootkit to hide the presence of the malware. While it is mentioned in the question, it does not establish a communication channel.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique for establishing a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C server is **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**. This aligns with the question's requirement and the related TTPs provided.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication
