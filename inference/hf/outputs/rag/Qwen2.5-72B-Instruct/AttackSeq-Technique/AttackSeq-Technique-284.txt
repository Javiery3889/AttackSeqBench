### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred after the initial access via spear-phishing emails with exploit documents and before the use of encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with links to malicious websites.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique involves using HTML smuggling to bypass security mechanisms and deliver malicious content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved using spear-phishing emails with exploit documents, which aligns with **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The next step involves bypassing detection using encoded blobs, which aligns with **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**.
   - **Intermediate Step:**
     - We need to identify the technique that likely occurred between these two steps.
     - **T1059.011-Lua:** This technique involves using Lua scripts, which is not directly related to the context of the question.
     - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which is a common step after gaining initial access to execute further actions.
     - **T1087.001-Local Account:** This technique involves enumerating local accounts, which is not directly related to the context of the question.
     - **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is a common step after gaining initial access to escalate privileges or move laterally.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** (Initial Access)
     2. **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** (Post-Initial Access, Pre-Defense Evasion)
     3. **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling** (Defense Evasion)

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
