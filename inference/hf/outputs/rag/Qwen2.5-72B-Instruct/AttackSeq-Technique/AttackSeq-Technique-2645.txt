### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where data is collected, staged in a temporary folder, encrypted, and then transmitted to a C&C server.
   - The focus is on the technique used to transmit the files to the C&C server after the data has been collected, staged, and encrypted.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system and staging it in a temporary folder.
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves collecting data from remote systems and staging it in a temporary folder.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing and encrypting the collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system. It is not related to the transmission of data to a C&C server.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not part of the C2 channel. This could be a plausible choice if the data is being exfiltrated over a non-C2 channel.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using the established C2 channel. This is a common method for transmitting data to a C&C server.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open ports. It is not related to the transmission of data to a C&C server.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the data has been collected, staged, and encrypted, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the data to the C&C server.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the most appropriate technique for this step, as it directly involves transmitting the data over the established C2 channel.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
