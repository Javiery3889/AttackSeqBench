### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access scenario where users were tricked into downloading a fake app from a fraudulent website. This is a common technique used in drive-by compromises and spearphishing attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves an adversary luring users to a website that contains malicious content, which can then exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser or other software to gain initial access.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link:** This technique involves sending targeted emails with links to malicious websites or files, often designed to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves adversaries using system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It is not typically the next step after gaining initial access through a drive-by compromise.
   - **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves adversaries discovering files and directories on the compromised system. This is a common next step after gaining initial access to understand the environment and identify valuable data.
   - **C: T1569.002-Service Execution:** This technique involves adversaries using system services to execute malicious code. While this can be a follow-up action, it is less likely to be the immediate next step after a drive-by compromise.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves adversaries transferring additional tools or malware to the compromised system. This is a common next step after gaining initial access to deploy more sophisticated tools or malware.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the initial access through a drive-by compromise, the most likely next step would be to transfer additional tools or malware to the compromised system to further the attack. This aligns with the technique **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
