### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the Raccoon stealer is executed to collect data, and then it bypasses blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.
   - The key points are:
     - Data collection (system information, account data, crypto wallet details).
     - Bypassing blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel.
     - Receiving encrypted C&C server addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a victim's system to a system under the adversary's control.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves the transfer of data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing:**
     - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. While phishing could be used to initially infect a system, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:**
     - Obfuscation is used to make code or data harder to understand. This could be relevant if the Raccoon stealer is obfuscating its code or data, but it does not directly relate to the network requests or C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification:**
     - This technique involves changing file and directory permissions to gain access or hide malicious activities. While it could be used to facilitate the execution of the stealer, it does not directly relate to the network requests or C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1010-Application Window Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying running processes and open windows on a system. While it could be used to gather information about the system, it does not directly relate to the network requests or C&C communication.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most relevant technique to the sequence of events described in the question is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**. The Raccoon stealer likely uses obfuscation to bypass detection and make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
