### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Korplug, a malware, communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol with encrypted communication.
   - The focus is on maintaining communication if a primary server becomes unavailable.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication, such as custom TCP-based protocols.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary channel is unavailable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1008-Fallback Channels:**
     - This technique directly addresses the need to maintain communication if the primary server becomes unavailable. It involves using alternative communication channels, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1124-System Time Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not relevant to maintaining communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names, which is useful for evading detection but does not directly address the need for fallback communication channels.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574.012-COR_PROFILER:**
     - This technique involves using the COR_PROFILER environment variable to inject code into managed applications, which is not relevant to maintaining communication with C&C servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that supports the campaign's ability to maintain communication if a primary server becomes unavailable is **T1008-Fallback Channels**.

**Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
