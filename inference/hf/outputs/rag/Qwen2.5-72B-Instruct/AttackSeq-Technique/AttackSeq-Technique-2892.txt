### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the 'yty' framework establishes persistence through a secondary macro in an Excel document named 'Circular.xls'.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred earlier in the attack sequence, specifically involving an Excel document containing an executable executed by macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves an attacker tricking a user into opening a malicious file, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.001-Office Template Macros:** This technique involves using macros in Office templates to maintain persistence on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While this could be part of an attack sequence, it does not directly involve an Excel document or macros.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification:** This technique involves changing file and directory permissions, which is not directly related to the initial execution of a malicious Excel document.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves sending malicious emails or messages to trick users into opening attachments or clicking on links. This aligns well with the scenario of a user being tricked into opening a malicious Excel document.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves techniques to avoid detection in virtualized or sandboxed environments, which is not directly related to the initial execution of a malicious Excel document.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the user was tricked into opening a malicious Excel document, which then executed an executable through macros. This aligns with the **T1566-Phishing** technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
