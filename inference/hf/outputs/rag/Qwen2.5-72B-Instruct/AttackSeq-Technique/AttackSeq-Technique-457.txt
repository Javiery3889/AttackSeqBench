### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the CEIDPageLock rootkit gathers browsing data and then establishes communication with hard-coded C&C domains to download a homepage configuration.
   - The focus is on the technique used to establish communication with the C&C domains.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a victim's system by having them visit a malicious website.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS requests to communicate with a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target:** This technique involves targeting specific individuals or groups through drive-by compromises.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software:** This technique is not relevant to establishing communication with C&C servers. It is more about using CRM software for malicious purposes, which does not fit the context.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves manipulating network traffic to evade detection. While it could be used in a broader attack, it is not specifically about establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with C&C servers. The specific sub-technique T1071.004-DNS is mentioned in the related TTPs, which is highly relevant to the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique is about the initial access method, not the communication with C&C servers. While it is mentioned in the related TTPs, it does not fit the specific context of establishing communication with C&C domains.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is the one that involves using DNS to establish communication with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
