### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was achieved via spear-phishing emails that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word documents.
   - After gaining initial access, an .EXE file packed with UPX was dropped to the %System% folder.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred next.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Microsoft Word) to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing:** This technique involves modifying the arguments passed to a process to hide malicious activity. This is not typically the next step after dropping an .EXE file.
   - **B: T1600-Weaken Encryption:** This technique involves weakening or bypassing encryption to gain access to data. This is not directly related to the execution of an .EXE file.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware is executed automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common next step after dropping an .EXE file to ensure persistence.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers:** This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems. This is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after dropping an .EXE file to the %System% folder is to ensure that the malware is executed automatically. This aligns with the technique **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
