### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Dragonfly attackers used reconnaissance methods (spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits) to gather information and then transitioned to gaining access to the victim network.
   - The focus is on what technique likely occurred after the initial reconnaissance and initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique is part of the Initial Access tactic and involves sending spear-phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique is also part of the Initial Access tactic and involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to victims.
   - **T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique is part of the Reconnaissance tactic and involves using spear-phishing emails to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique is part of the Discovery tactic and involves identifying active user accounts and their roles. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access to the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing:** This is a broad category that includes various phishing techniques, including spear-phishing. However, the question specifies that the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing:** This is the same as B and is not the most plausible next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1585.002-Email Accounts:** This technique is part of the Collection tactic and involves collecting email accounts, which is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access through reconnaissance and initial access techniques would be to discover active user accounts and their roles to further navigate the network.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **T1087-Account Discovery**.

**Final Answer: A: T1087-Account Discovery**
