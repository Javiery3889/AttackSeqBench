### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where HTML Smuggling is used to bypass security controls for deploying ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure that the malicious payloads are not tagged with the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling:** This technique is used to bypass security controls by embedding malicious content in HTML files.
   - **T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass:** This technique is used to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web, which is a security feature that tags files downloaded from the internet to prevent them from being executed without user interaction.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves renaming or masquerading files to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malicious code, which is not directly related to bypassing MOTW.
   - **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure:** This technique involves compromising infrastructure to support the attack, which is not directly related to bypassing MOTW.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This is a broader category that includes T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass, which is directly related to the question.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves using resource forks to hide data, which is not directly related to bypassing MOTW.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**. This is because T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass is a specific sub-technique under T1553-Subvert Trust Controls and is directly relevant to ensuring that the malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW.

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
