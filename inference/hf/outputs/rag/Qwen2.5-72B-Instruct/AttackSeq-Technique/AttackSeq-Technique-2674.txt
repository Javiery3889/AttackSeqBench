### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the OceanLotus malware:
     - Establishes persistence through the creation of a Launch Agent.
     - Modifies its location and filename based on the user's UID.
     - Surveys the victim's computer.
     - Encrypts the gathered information.
     - Sends the encrypted information to the command and control server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a Launch Agent to maintain persistence on macOS systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1600-Weaken Encryption:**
     - This technique involves weakening the encryption used to protect data. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about gathering and encrypting information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering remote systems on the network. While it is a discovery technique, it is not specifically about gathering information about the local system.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the local system, which aligns with the step where the backdoor surveys the victim's computer.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the execution flow of a process, which is more related to persistence and not the surveying and encryption of information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
