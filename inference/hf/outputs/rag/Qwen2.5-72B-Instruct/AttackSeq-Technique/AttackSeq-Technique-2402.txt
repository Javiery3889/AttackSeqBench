### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to interact with a malicious link, leading to the download of trojanized files.
   - The subsequent step involves the removal of attack artifacts using a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**:
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**:
     - This sub-technique specifically involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**:
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
     - While this could be used to run the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, it is not specific to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **B: T1585-Establish Accounts**:
     - This technique involves creating or modifying accounts to maintain access.
     - This is not relevant to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**:
     - This technique involves sending data to an attacker-controlled system.
     - This is not relevant to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**:
     - This sub-technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands and scripts.
     - This is more specific to the execution of the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, which is used to remove attack artifacts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using a Windows command shell to execute the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, which aligns with the technique T1059.003-Windows Command Shell.

**Final Answer: D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
