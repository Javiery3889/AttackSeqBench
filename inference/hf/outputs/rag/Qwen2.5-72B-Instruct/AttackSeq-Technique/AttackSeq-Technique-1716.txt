### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique used by Mustang Panda to deploy malicious payloads using embedded '.lnk' files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell:** This technique involves maintaining access to a system by deploying a web shell, which is not directly related to initial access.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** Phishing involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, often via email, to steal sensitive data or install malware. This is a common method for initial access and can involve malicious links or attachments.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising malicious files or programs as legitimate ones. While it can be used to maintain persistence or execute payloads, it is not typically the initial access method.
   - **C: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations:** This technique involves altering cloud compute configurations to maintain access or execute malicious code, which is not relevant to initial access.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems, which is not typically the method used for initial access in the context of embedded '.lnk' files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for initial access using embedded '.lnk' files is **T1566-Phishing**. Phishing is a common method for delivering malicious payloads, and it can involve sending emails with embedded '.lnk' files that, when clicked, execute the malicious code.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
