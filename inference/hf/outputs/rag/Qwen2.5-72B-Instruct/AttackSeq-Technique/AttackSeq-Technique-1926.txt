### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious Firefox browser extension (FriarFox) is delivered via a phishing email.
   - The extension is used for defense evasion.
   - The extension then contacts a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1176-Browser Extensions:** This technique involves using browser extensions to maintain persistence on a victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising the true nature of a file, process, or other system entity to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. While it is possible that the communication could be encrypted, the question does not specifically mention encryption.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems. This does not fit the context of the extension contacting a server to retrieve a payload.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This fits well with the scenario where the extension contacts a server to retrieve a payload.
   - **D: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a session to a remote service. This does not fit the context of the extension contacting a server to retrieve a payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of an application layer protocol to communicate with the server and retrieve the payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
