### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the VBA code within the external template decrypted data from the malicious Microsoft Word document and dropped it into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.
   - The key points are:
     - VBA code within an external template.
     - Decryption of data from a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     - Dropping the decrypted data into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection:**
     - This technique involves using a template to inject malicious code into a document, which aligns with the VBA code within the external template.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic:**
     - This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code, which aligns with the VBA code mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. Given that the VBA code dropped a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1'), this is a strong candidate.
   - **B: T1053.002-At:**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the 'at' command, which is not directly related to the execution of the dropped files.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which is not directly related to the execution of the dropped files.
   - **D: T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System:**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying the Linux audit system, which is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the VBA code within the external template decrypted data and dropped it into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg', the next step would be to execute the PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') using a command and scripting interpreter.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred next is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
