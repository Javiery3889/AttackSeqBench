### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the malware first uses defense evasion techniques, specifically self-deletion on a hardcoded date to avoid detection.
   - After this, the malware collects detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, during its reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection, which aligns with the self-deletion mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting detailed information about the system, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which is a broader category and not specifically about collecting system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique directly involves collecting detailed information about the system, which matches the description in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook, which is not related to the reconnaissance phase described.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting information from the browser, which is more specific to browser-related data and not the broader system information described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the related TTPs and the description in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the malware uses defense evasion techniques, it performs system information discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
