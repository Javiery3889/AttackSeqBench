### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already established persistence using a service and a registry Run key.
   - The next step in the sequence involves padding the ShadowPad samples to over 50MB and deleting the third file in the three-file execution chain to remove traces of malicious activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1543.003-Windows Service:** This technique involves creating or modifying a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - **T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This technique involves removing or modifying artifacts that indicate the presence of persistence mechanisms.
   - **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder:** This technique involves creating or modifying registry Run keys or startup folder entries to achieve persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment. While this could be part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not directly relate to the described sequence of padding and deleting files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This could be relevant to the deletion of the third file to remove traces of malicious activity.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1098.003-Additional Cloud Roles**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying cloud roles to maintain persistence. This is not relevant to the described sequence involving local file operations.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing actions to coincide with specific events or times. While this could be used to avoid detection, it does not directly relate to the described sequence of padding and deleting files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique aligns with the deletion of the third file to remove traces of malicious activity, which is a form of hiding artifacts to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
