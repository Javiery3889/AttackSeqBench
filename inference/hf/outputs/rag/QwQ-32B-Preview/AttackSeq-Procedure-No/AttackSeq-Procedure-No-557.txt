Alright, I've got this question about a malware called skip-2.0 and its backdoor that uses DLL hijacking to persist on a system. Then, it's asking if, after achieving persistence, the Inner-Loader component is likely to perform process discovery targeting MSSQL Server and use hooks in sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses. The answer choices are simply Yes or No. I have some related TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to help me understand this.

First, I need to break down the question and understand each part. So, skip-2.0 is a backdoor that achieves persistence through DLL hijacking via the Windows SessionEnv service. DLL hijacking is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory where an application is likely to look for a DLL, and then the application loads the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one. This is a way to hijack the execution flow and gain code execution.

The backdoor achieves persistence by loading at system startup via the SessionEnv service. SessionEnv is a Windows service that handles session environment variables, and if the backdoor can hook into this service, it can ensure it runs at every system startup.

Now, the question is asking about the Inner-Loader component of this backdoor. After persistence is achieved, does the Inner-Loader perform process discovery targeting MSSQL Server and then employ multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service to bypass authentication and evade defenses?

I need to think about whether this sequence makes sense from a malware behavior perspective.

First, process discovery is a technique where malware looks for specific processes running on the system that it can target or interact with. In this case, targeting MSSQL Server suggests that the malware is interested in compromising SQL Server instances for some purpose, possibly exfiltrating data, installing backdoors within the database, or using the server as a pivot point to move laterally within the network.

Hooking into sqllang.dll, which is a DLL associated with MSSQL Server, to bypass authentication and evade defenses sounds like a sophisticated attack aimed at gaining access to the SQL Server without proper credentials and avoiding detection by security mechanisms.

So, is this likely?

Well, considering that the backdoor has already achieved persistence through DLL hijacking, it's plausible that it would look for high-value targets like database servers to further its objectives. Database servers often hold sensitive information, so compromising them could be a key goal for an attacker.

Moreover, using hooks in sqllang.dll to bypass authentication suggests that the malware is trying to access the SQL Server without going through normal authentication channels, which could be to avoid alerting system administrators or to gain higher privileges within the database.

Evading defenses would be a natural part of any malware's behavior to ensure its longevity and effectiveness on the target system.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking

- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking

- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking

These indicate that DLL search order hijacking is being used for multiple tactics: defense evasion, privilege escalation, and persistence. This suggests that the technique is multifaceted and can be leveraged in different ways throughout the attack lifecycle.

Given that, it's possible that after achieving persistence, the malware might look to escalate privileges further or to move laterally within the network, which could involve targeting specific processes like MSSQL Server.

However, I need to consider whether performing process discovery and hooking into sqllang.dll is a likely next step based on the initial use of DLL hijacking for persistence.

DLL hijacking is a method to gain code execution and persistence, but targeting specific processes like MSSQL Server might be part of a more targeted attack aimed at accessing sensitive data or compromising specific services.

Alternatively, maybe the malware is more general-purpose and doesn't necessarily target MSSQL Server specifically.

But given that the question specifies targeting MSSQL Server, it's probably part of a campaign where the attacker knows or suspects that MSSQL Server is present and valuable.

So, considering all this, is it likely that the Inner-Loader component would perform process discovery for MSSQL Server and then hook into sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses?

Well, if the malware is specifically designed to target SQL Server environments, then yes, this sequence makes sense.

But if it's a more generic malware, it might not necessarily target MSSQL Server specifically.

However, since the question mentions that the Inner-Loader performs these actions, and given that DLL hijacking has already provided persistence, it's plausible that the next steps involve more targeted actions like process discovery and hooking specific DLLs.

Moreover, hooking sqllang.dll to bypass authentication aligns with the defense evasion and privilege escalation tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques involved, it does seem likely that the Inner-Loader would perform these actions.

So, my answer would be Yes.
