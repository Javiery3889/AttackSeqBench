Alright, I've got this question here about a cyber attack campaign observed by FireEye. It's a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

So, FireEye saw that in this campaign, two different single-byte XOR keys were used to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers. Now, the question is asking whether, after observing this, it's likely that the attackers rebooted the target system once their wiping processes were complete, instead of launching DDoS attacks against certain websites.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me try to rephrase it to understand better. It appears that the attackers encoded their configuration files using XOR encryption with different single-byte keys. Then, they might have performed some wiping processes on the target system. The question is whether, after these wiping processes, they rebooted the system instead of launching DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, which apparently caused a 'total failure' in Next Media's network.

First, I need to understand the context here. It seems like there's an attack campaign where the adversaries are using encryption to hide their configuration files, and they're also engaging in wiping activities and DDoS attacks.

Looking at the answer choices: A: Yes, it's likely they rebooted instead of launching DDoS attacks; B: No, it's not likely.

Now, the related TTPs provided are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded Files

2. Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service

Okay, so in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Defense Evasion involves techniques used by adversaries to prevent detection or analysis of their activities. Encrypted or encoded files are a way to hide the true nature of the files from security tools.

The second TTP is under the Impact tactic, which is about disrupting or harming mission operations. Endpoint Denial of Service is a technique where the adversary performs actions that render the device unusable, such as modifying critical system processes or data.

Given these TTPs, I need to see how they relate to the question.

First, the use of encrypted/encoded files suggests that the adversaries are trying to hide their configurations from being easily discernible. Using different single-byte XOR keys might indicate that they are trying to add an extra layer of obfuscation, possibly to make analysis harder or to ensure that each configuration is unique.

Now, regarding the wiping processes, this could be part of their cleanup activities to remove traces of their presence or to damage the target system. If they perform wiping processes, it might be to erase logs, delete files, or overwrite data to make forensic analysis difficult.

The question then is whether, after these wiping processes, they reboot the system instead of launching DDoS attacks against specific websites.

I need to think about the motives and the sequence of actions here. If their goal is to disrupt the target organization, launching DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong could be a way to achieve that. Causing a 'total failure' in Next Media's network suggests that their aim is to severely impact the operations of this media company.

However, if they choose to reboot the system after wiping processes, it might be to ensure that the changes they made take effect, or to restart services in a controlled manner.

But the question is asking whether it's likely that they rebooted instead of launching the DDoS attacks.

To answer this, I need to consider the objectives of the attackers. If their primary goal is to cause disruption through DDoS attacks, then it would make sense for them to launch those attacks. However, if their goal is to damage the target system itself, then performing wiping processes and rebooting might be part of that strategy.

Additionally, the use of different encryption keys for configuration files could indicate that they are preparing for different stages of the attack or that they have multiple campaigns running.

Looking back at the related TTPs, Defense Evasion suggests they are trying to hide their activities, and Impact suggests they are aiming to cause harm or disruption.

Given that they are observed using encrypted configuration files and performing wiping processes, it seems that they are engaged in both hiding their activities and causing impact.

Now, considering the answer choices:

A: Yes, it's likely they rebooted instead of launching DDoS attacks.

B: No, it's not likely.

I need to decide which one makes more sense based on the information provided.

If their goal is to cause disruption through DDoS attacks, then it would be illogical for them to reboot the system instead of launching those attacks. Rebooting the system might interrupt their attack operations.

On the other hand, if their goal is to damage the target system itself, then performing wiping processes and rebooting makes more sense.

But the question mentions that they caused a 'total failure' in Next Media's network by launching DDoS attacks against specific websites. So, it seems that launching DDoS attacks was part of their strategy to cause disruption.

However, the question is whether, after the wiping processes, they rebooted the system instead of launching these DDoS attacks.

This suggests that there is a sequence: wiping processes followed by either rebooting or launching DDoS attacks.

Given that they are observed using encrypted configuration files, which could be for either purpose, it's not immediately clear which action they would take next.

But considering that launching DDoS attacks is likely to cause immediate disruption, whereas rebooting the system might be necessary to complete their wiping activities, I need to think about their endgame.

If their aim is to cause immediate disruption through DDoS attacks, they would probably prefer to launch those attacks without rebooting, as rebooting could interrupt the attack operations.

Alternatively, if their main goal is to damage the target system and cause long-term disruption, then rebooting after wiping processes might be part of that plan.

However, the question specifies that launching DDoS attacks would cause the 'total failure' in Next Media's network, implying that the DDoS attacks are the primary means of causing disruption.

Given that, it seems less likely that they would choose to reboot the system instead of launching the DDoS attacks.

Moreover, rebooting the system might reset the DDoS agents or disrupt the attack infrastructure, which would not align with their goal of causing disruption.

Therefore, it's more plausible that they would launch the DDoS attacks as intended, rather than rebooting the system.

So, the answer should be B: No, it's not likely that they rebooted instead of launching the DDoS attacks.

But let me consider another angle. Maybe they rebooted the system to ensure that the wiping processes were complete and to prevent any remnants from being used to trace their activities, before launching the DDoS attacks.

In that case, rebooting could be a step in their attack sequence before initiating the DDoS phase.

However, the question is phrased in a way that suggests that rebooting would be instead of launching the DDoS attacks, not in addition to them.

Given that, and considering the goals of the attackers, it seems more logical that they would choose to launch the DDoS attacks to achieve their disruptive objectives, rather than rebooting the system.

Therefore, my final answer is B: No, it's not likely that they rebooted instead of launching the DDoS attacks.

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
