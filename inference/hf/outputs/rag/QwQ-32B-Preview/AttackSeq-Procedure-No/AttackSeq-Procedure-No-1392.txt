Alright, I've got this question about FIN13 and their potential sequence of actions during an attack. The question is whether it's likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager using the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance. There are two answer choices: A) Yes and B) No. I need to decide which one makes more sense based on the related TTPs provided.

First, let's break down the question. FIN13 is a known threat actor group, and they have specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they typically use in their operations. The question is asking about a specific sequence of actions: first, retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using a module called enum_secrets, and then gathering information about the network and host configurations using native OS binaries.

The related TTPs provided are:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery

2. Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.006 - Cloud Secrets Management Stores

3. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083 - File and Directory Discovery

So, these are the specific techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework that are relevant to this question.

Let me start by understanding what each of these techniques entails.

First, T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery. This is under the Discovery tactic, which means it's about the adversary trying to understand the environment they're in. Specifically, this technique involves the adversary gathering information about the network setup, such as IP addresses, routing configurations, and other network parameters. This helps them map out the network and identify potential targets or pathways for lateral movement.

Next, T1555.006 - Cloud Secrets Management Stores. This falls under the Credential Access tactic, which is about adversaries trying to obtain credentials and other access tokens. Specifically, this technique refers to accessing secrets stored in cloud-based secret management systems, like AWS Secrets Manager. These stores often hold sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and other credentials that can be extremely valuable to an attacker.

Lastly, T1083 - File and Directory Discovery. Again, under the Discovery tactic, this technique involves the adversary looking for specific files or directories that contain information useful to their objectives. This could include configuration files, logs, or other data that helps them understand the environment or find valuable data.

Now, the question is asking about the sequence of these actions. Specifically, whether FIN13 would first retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using the enum_secrets module and then proceed to gather information about network and host configurations using native OS binaries.

To answer this, I need to think about the typical sequence of events in an attack and whether this particular sequence makes sense.

First, considering that enum_secrets is a module likely used to enumerate or list out the secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager, it's a way for the adversary to quickly gain access to a wealth of potentially useful credentials and other sensitive information. This would be a high-value target early in the attack, as these secrets could provide broader access to the environment or even to other cloud services.

On the other hand, gathering information about network and host configurations is more about understanding the environment, mapping out the network, identifying key systems, and planning for lateral movement. This is also part of the discovery phase but is more focused on the infrastructure rather than on specific credentials.

So, in terms of sequence, it might make sense for an adversary to first try to acquire as many credentials as possible, especially high-value ones like those stored in AWS Secrets Manager, and then use those credentials to facilitate their discovery of the network and host configurations. Alternatively, they might perform some initial discovery to identify where such secrets are stored before targeting them.

However, considering that AWS Secrets Manager is a central repository for secrets, accessing it early could provide the adversary with the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. With access to these secrets, they could potentially bypass many security controls and gain elevated access to various systems and data.

Therefore, it's plausible that FIN13 would prioritize accessing the AWS Secrets Manager early in their attack sequence.

But let's consider the specifics of the question. It mentions that after retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module, FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

So, the sequence is:

1. Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using enum_secrets.

2. Use native OS binaries to gather information on network and host configurations.

Is this a likely sequence?

Well, after gaining access to secrets, especially those that provide elevated privileges, an adversary might use those credentials to escalate their access and then perform more in-depth discovery using the native tools available on the systems they've compromised.

Using native OS binaries for reconnaissance is a common tactic because these tools are already present on the systems and don't require downloading additional malware, which could trigger security alerts.

So, in this sequence, accessing the secrets first would give them the credentials needed to perform more effective discovery using native tools.

Additionally, having access to secrets might provide them with the necessary credentials to access different parts of the network or different systems, allowing them to gather more comprehensive information about the network and host configurations.

Therefore, this sequence does make sense from a tactical perspective.

But let's consider if there are any reasons why this sequence might not be likely.

One possible consideration is that if the adversary accesses the AWS Secrets Manager early on, and if this action is detected by security monitoring tools, it could alert the defenders and interrupt the attack. However, sophisticated threat groups like FIN13 likely have methods to minimize detection risk.

Another consideration is whether the adversary would need to perform some initial discovery to even know that AWS Secrets Manager is in use and where it's located. However, if FIN13 is a group that specifically targets AWS environments, they might have prior knowledge or intelligence about the use of AWS Secrets Manager in their targets.

Furthermore, the enum_secrets module seems to be a tool specifically designed to interact with AWS Secrets Manager, so it's likely that FIN13 has prior knowledge of its presence and importance.

Given all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that FIN13 would attempt to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager early in the attack sequence and then use those secrets to facilitate further discovery activities using native OS binaries.

Therefore, the answer should be A) Yes, it is likely that FIN13 will follow this sequence of TTPs.

But to be thorough, let's consider the alternative answer, B) No.

If I were to choose B) No, I would need to have a good reason why this sequence is not likely for FIN13.

One possible reason could be if FIN13 typically follows a different sequence of actions, perhaps performing broader discovery before targeting specific credential stores. However, given that AWS Secrets Manager contains high-value information, it's generally more beneficial to access it early to maximize the potential gains.

Another reason could be if accessing AWS Secrets Manager requires certain privileges that FIN13 might not have at the early stages of the attack. But if they're using a module like enum_secrets, it suggests they have the means to access it.

Alternatively, if FIN13 prefers to minimize their actions to avoid detection, they might choose to perform more stealthy discovery techniques before going after obvious credential stores. However, sophisticated groups often balance risk and reward and may still choose to go after high-value targets early if the potential payoff is significant.

Given these considerations, I don't see strong reasons to choose B) No.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A) Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
