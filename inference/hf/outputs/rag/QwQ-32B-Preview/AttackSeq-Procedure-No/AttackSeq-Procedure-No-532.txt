Alright, I've got this question here about whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim's machine after evading defenses and downloading additional malware. The answer choices are yes or no. And there are two related TTPs provided: one is under the tactic of Credential Access, technique T1555.003, which is "Credentials from Web Browsers," and the other is also under Credential Access, technique T1539, which is "Steal Web Session Cookie."

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It seems like there's an attack where the adversary evades defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts to download more malware, specifically the Dropping Elephant backdoor. Then, the question is asking if this backdoor is likely to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari.

So, I need to think about the purpose of such an attack and whether stealing browser cookies fits into the attack sequence described.

Let me start by breaking down the attack sequence:

1. The adversary is evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts.

2. These scripts are used to download additional malware, specifically the Dropping Elephant backdoor.

Now, the question is about what this backdoor is likely to do, specifically whether it's likely to steal browser cookies.

First, I should understand what a backdoor is. A backdoor is a method or a program that allows an attacker to gain access to a computer or other resource, often bypassing normal authentication mechanisms. Backdoors can be used for various purposes, such as maintaining persistent access, exfiltrating data, or conducting further malicious activities.

In this case, the backdoor is called "Dropping Elephant." I don't know much about this specific backdoor, but based on the name and the context, it seems like it's a piece of malware designed to provide ongoing access to the compromised system.

Now, the question is whether this backdoor is likely to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari.

To answer this, I need to consider the objectives of the attacker. Why would they want to steal browser cookies?

Browser cookies can contain sensitive information, such as session tokens, which can be used to gain access to the user's online accounts without knowing their passwords. This can be valuable for various reasons, such as:

- Conducting further attacks under the guise of the legitimate user.

- Stealing personal information.

- Committing financial fraud.

- Engaging in espionage or other malicious activities.

Given that, it seems plausible that an attacker might want to steal browser cookies as part of their campaign.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers.

2. Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie.

Both of these techniques are related to stealing credentials from web browsers, which aligns directly with the question of stealing browser cookies.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Credential Access tactic is about obtaining credentials such as passwords, keys, or other authentication tokens. Techniques under this tactic involve various methods of extracting these credentials from the system.

T1555.003 specifically refers to obtaining credentials from web browsers, which can include passwords, cookies, history, and other sensitive information. T1539 is more specific, focusing on stealing web session cookies.

Given that these techniques are related to the question, it suggests that stealing browser cookies is a plausible action for the backdoor to perform.

Now, considering the attack sequence:

- The adversary has already evaded defenses and downloaded the backdoor.

- The backdoor is likely designed to maintain access and possibly exfiltrate data.

Given this, it makes sense that the backdoor would be designed to steal valuable information, including browser cookies, to further the attacker's objectives.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, it seems likely that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is designed to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari.

But let's think about this a bit more.

First, why specifically Google Chrome and Apple Safari?

Google Chrome is one of the most widely used web browsers, so it's a logical target for attackers seeking to maximize their chances of obtaining useful cookies.

Apple Safari is the default browser on Apple devices, which might be targeted depending on the attacker's goals and the victim population.

So, targeting these specific browsers makes sense from a practical standpoint.

Additionally, both browsers store cookies in specific locations and formats, which malware can be programmed to access and exfiltrate.

Now, considering the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the analysis above, it seems that answer A, "Yes," is the most plausible.

However, to be thorough, I should consider any reasons why the answer might be "No."

For example, perhaps the backdoor has a specific purpose that doesn't involve stealing browser cookies. Maybe it's designed for espionage and focuses on exfiltrating specific types of documents or data, and stealing browser cookies is not part of its functionality.

Alternatively, maybe the backdoor is designed to perform other types of malicious activities, such as cryptojacking or launching DDoS attacks, and doesn't need browser cookies for those purposes.

But, given that the related TTPs specifically mention stealing credentials from web browsers and stealing web session cookies, it suggests that these activities are part of the attacker's toolkit.

Furthermore, in many cyber-attacks, stealing browser cookies can be a useful way to gain access to various online accounts, which can provide the attacker with more opportunities for exploitation.

Therefore, unless there's specific information indicating that the backdoor doesn't engage in credential theft, it's reasonable to assume that it does.

In conclusion, based on the attack sequence described and the related TTPs, it's likely that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is designed to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim's machine.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
