Alright, I've got this question about cybersecurity and I need to figure out the best answer based on some tactics and techniques. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is: "Is it likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase?" And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, FamousSparrow is presumably an attacker or a threat actor, and the question is asking about their likely actions in a cyber attack. Specifically, it's asking if they would steal application access tokens through phishing emails with malicious links, and then proceed to collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase.

I need to decide if this sequence of actions makes sense based on what I know about cyber attacks and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Let's start by understanding the terms here.

First, "application access tokens" are basically credentials that allow access to certain applications or services. Phishing emails with malicious links are a common way to trick users into giving up their credentials or installing malware that can steal them.

The Discovery phase is part of the attack lifecycle where the attacker tries to understand the target environment better. This includes collecting system information and probing files to see what's valuable or how to move laterally within the network.

So, the sequence suggested is:

1. Steal application access tokens via phishing emails.

2. Use those tokens to gain access to the system.

3. Once inside, collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase.

Does this make sense?

Well, in many cyber attacks, the initial access is indeed gained through phishing emails that contain malicious links or attachments. These links could lead to a fake login page where the user enters their credentials, which are then captured by the attacker, or the links could contain exploits that download malware onto the victim's machine.

So, the first part about stealing application access tokens via phishing emails seems plausible.

Now, once the attacker has these tokens, they can use them to access the applications, which would give them a foothold in the system.

After gaining initial access, it's standard procedure for an attacker to conduct Discovery to understand the environment better. This includes gathering information about the system, network, and potential targets of interest.

So, collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase also makes sense.

Therefore, the sequence outlined in the question seems logical and aligns with common attack patterns.

But, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any reasons why this might not be likely.

One thing to consider is that stealing application access tokens via phishing might not always directly lead to access to system information and files. It depends on what those tokens grant access to. If the tokens provide access to specific applications that don't have access to system information or files, then the attacker might need to take additional steps to gain that access.

However, in many cases, especially if the tokens are for administrative or high-privilege accounts, they could indeed provide access to system information and files.

Another consideration is that modern security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), can mitigate the effectiveness of stolen tokens. If the applications require MFA, simply having the token might not be enough to gain access.

But the question doesn't specify anything about MFA being in place, so we'll assume that the tokens are sufficient for access.

Also, it's possible that after gaining initial access through phishing, the attacker might use other techniques to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network before conducting Discovery. But the question specifically mentions collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase, which typically follows initial access.

Given this, I think the sequence makes sense.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link.

T1566.002 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework corresponds to Spearphishing Link, which is a specific type of phishing where the attacker sends targeted emails with malicious links to specific individuals or groups.

This aligns with the initial access method described in the question, which is phishing emails containing malicious links.

So, the related TTP confirms that the initial access vector is likely to be spearphishing links.

Given all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But to make sure, let's consider if there are any other factors that might influence this decision.

For example, if there was information suggesting that FamousSparrow uses different initial access vectors or doesn't typically conduct Discovery in this manner, that might change the answer.

However, since no such information is provided, and based on general knowledge of cyber attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence seems likely.

Hence, my final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
