Alright, I've got this question about a cyber campaign that starts with phishing emails and possibly exploits a specific vulnerability in FortiOS devices. The question is whether it's likely that after gaining initial access through phishing emails with a malicious Word document, the attackers will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." To answer this, I need to think carefully about the attack sequence and see if exploiting this particular vulnerability makes sense in this context.

First, let's break down the information given:

- There's a campaign involving phishing emails.

- These emails contain a malicious file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.

- The question is about whether it's likely that after gaining initial access through these phishing emails, the attackers will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

So, the initial access is achieved through spearphishing attachments, which aligns with the phishing emails containing the malicious Word document. Then, there's also a reference to exploiting a public-facing application, which might relate to the exploitation of the FortiOS vulnerability.

To determine whether it's likely that the attackers will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access via phishing, I need to consider a few factors:

1. **Relevance of the Vulnerability:** Is CVE-2018-13379 related to FortiOS devices, and is it something that could be exploited in the context of this attack?

2. **Sequence of Attack Steps:** Does it make sense for attackers to exploit this vulnerability after gaining initial access through phishing?

3. **Objective of the Attackers:** What are the likely goals of the attackers, and how does exploiting this vulnerability help achieve those goals?

Let's start by understanding what CVE-2018-13379 is. A quick search tells me that CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiOS SSL-VPN before 6.0.2, 5.6.9, and 5.4.12, which allows remote attackers to conduct path traversal attacks and read arbitrary files via a crafted URI.

So, this is a vulnerability in FortiOS devices that can be exploited remotely to read arbitrary files by crafting a specific URI.

Now, considering that the initial access is gained through phishing emails with a malicious Word document, I need to think about how this relates to exploiting a vulnerability in FortiOS devices.

Phishing emails are a common method for initial access because they can trick users into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links, which can lead to the execution of malware on their systems.

Once the malware is executed, the attackers might have a foothold in the network, depending on the user's privileges and the environment.

Now, if the network has FortiOS devices, such as firewalls or VPNs, these devices could be targets for further exploitation.

Exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices could allow the attackers to gain access to sensitive information or potentially compromise the device itself, depending on the vulnerability's impact.

But is it likely that the attackers would exploit this vulnerability after gaining initial access through phishing?

Well, it depends on a few things:

- **Presence of FortiOS Devices:** Are FortiOS devices present in the target network? If not, exploiting this vulnerability wouldn't make sense.

- **Vulnerability Status:** Is the FortiOS device vulnerable to CVE-2018-13379? If it's been patched, the exploit wouldn't work.

- **Attackers' Objectives:** What do the attackers aim to achieve? If their goal is to gain access to sensitive data or to move laterally within the network, exploiting this vulnerability could be a step towards achieving that.

- **Opportunity and Ease of Exploitation:** How easy is it to exploit this vulnerability once initial access is gained? If the exploit is readily available and the prerequisites are met, it might be a viable step for the attackers.

Considering these points, it seems plausible that attackers who have gained initial access through phishing might look for opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in network devices like FortiOS to further their objectives.

However, whether it's likely in this specific case depends on the context.

Given that the related TTPs include both spearphishing attachments and exploiting public-facing applications, it suggests that the attack involves multiple stages and techniques.

Exploiting a vulnerability in FortiOS devices could be part of the attack chain, especially if the device is exposed to the initial access vector or if the attackers can reach it from the compromised system.

But, without more specific information about the target network's architecture and the relationship between the compromised system and the FortiOS devices, it's hard to say with certainty.

Moreover, CVE-2018-13379 is a specific vulnerability, and attackers might have various other options depending on the environment.

Therefore, while it's possible that the attackers might exploit this vulnerability, it's not necessarily likely without additional context suggesting that FortiOS devices are present and vulnerable.

Given that, I would lean towards answering "No," meaning it's not likely that they will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

My reasoning is that while exploiting vulnerabilities in network devices can be part of an attack sequence, it's not a guaranteed step, and without specific indicators that FortiOS devices are present and vulnerable to this particular CVE, it's not the most likely scenario.

Attackers might have other, more straightforward paths to achieve their objectives without targeting this specific vulnerability.

Therefore, my final answer is:

**Final Answer: B**

**Final Answer: B**
