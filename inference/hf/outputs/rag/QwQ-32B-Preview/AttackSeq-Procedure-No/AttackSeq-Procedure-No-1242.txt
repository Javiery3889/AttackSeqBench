Alright, I've got this question about APT28 and their tactics for exfiltrating data. So, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is: After collecting data using crafted modules like pr.dll to upload stolen information to the C&C server, is it likely that APT28 will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more, targeting political figures and the aerospace industry? And the answer choices are simply Yes or No.

Okay, so APT28 is a known advanced persistent threat group, and they're notorious for their cyber espionage activities. They've been linked to various high-profile attacks, especially targeting political and governmental organizations, as well as industries like aerospace. So, the context here is that they've collected data using a module like pr.dll, which is likely a custom tool they've developed for data exfiltration.

Now, the question is about whether they would divide large files, specifically those 0x1000000 bytes or more, before uploading them to their command and control (C&C) server. 0x1000000 bytes is 16,777,216 bytes, which is roughly 16 MB. So, we're talking about splitting files that are 16 MB or larger.

I need to consider why an APT group like APT28 would or would not divide large files during exfiltration. There could be several reasons for doing so:

1. **Evasion Techniques:** Splitting files could help evade detection by security systems. For example, if a security system is set to alert on large data transfers, splitting the files into smaller chunks might fly under the radar.

2. **Reliability:** In some networks, there might be limitations on the size of files that can be transferred at once. By splitting files, APT28 can ensure a more reliable exfiltration process.

3. **Stealth:** Smaller file transfers might be less noticeable in network traffic, making the exfiltration harder to detect.

On the other hand, there might be reasons why they wouldn't split files:

1. **Complexity:** Splitting and reassembling files adds complexity to the exfiltration process, which could increase the risk of errors or detection.

2. **Time Consumption:** It might take longer to exfiltrate multiple smaller files compared to a single large file, especially if there are delays or retries involved.

Given that APT28 is a sophisticated group, they likely consider these factors carefully. Now, looking at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits

So, T1020, Automated Exfiltration, refers to the use of automated scripts or tools to exfiltrate data without manual intervention. This aligns with the use of crafted modules like pr.dll, which presumably automates the exfiltration process.

T1030, Data Transfer Size Limits, is specifically about dividing large amounts of data into smaller chunks to avoid detection or to comply with transfer size limitations.

Given that T1030 is directly related to splitting data for exfiltration, it suggests that APT groups, including APT28, may employ this technique as part of their exfiltration strategy.

Now, considering the question again: Is it likely that APT28 will divide files if the size is 16 MB or more, especially when targeting political figures and the aerospace industry?

Given that APT28 is known forå…¶ sophisticated tactics and attention to stealth, it's plausible that they would implement techniques like splitting large files to avoid detection. The related TTPs support this notion, particularly T1030.

However, I should also consider the specific context mentioned: targeting political figures and the aerospace industry. These are high-value targets, and APT28 is likely to exercise extra caution when exfiltrating data from such targets. Therefore, employing techniques like splitting files to avoid detection makes even more sense in this context.

Moreover, the use of a crafted module like pr.dll suggests that APT28 has developed custom tools for exfiltration, which could include functionality for splitting large files.

On the other hand, I should consider whether there are any indications that APT28 does not use this technique. However, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, there's no reason to believe that they wouldn't use such a technique.

Therefore, considering all these factors, it's likely that APT28 will divide files if the size is 16 MB or more when exfiltrating data from targets such as political figures and the aerospace industry.

So, my answer would be:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
