Alright, I've got this question about some backdoors and their communication with command and control servers. The question is a bit dense, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, it mentions PyFlash backdoor gathering OS-related information from the infected machine and sending it to the C&C server. Then, it asks whether NetFlash and PyFlash are likely to use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers, and specifically, if they use Asymmetric Cryptography.

So, let's start by understanding the components here:

1. **PyFlash backdoor**: This seems to be a type of malware that can gather information from an infected machine's operating system and send it to a command and control server.

2. **NetFlash**: I assume this is another variant or related piece of malware, possibly similar to PyFlash.

3. **C&C server**: This is the server that the malware communicates with to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

4. **HTTPS**: This is a secure way of communicating over the web, using SSL/TLS for encryption.

5. **Asymmetric Cryptography**: This is a type of cryptography that uses a pair of keys – a public key and a private key – for encrypting and decrypting data.

Now, the question is asking if it's likely that both NetFlash and PyFlash use HTTPS for their C&C communications, and specifically, if they use Asymmetric Cryptography.

Let's look at the related TTPs provided:

- **Tactic: Command and Control**

- **Technique: T1573.002 - Asymmetric Cryptography**

This indicates that the use of asymmetric cryptography in command and control communications is a known technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

So, considering that, here's my thought process:

- Malware often uses encryption to hide its communications from network security measures.

- HTTPS is a common protocol that uses TLS, which in turn uses asymmetric cryptography for key exchange.

- Therefore, it's plausible that malware might use HTTPS for C&C communications to blend in with normal web traffic and to encrypt their communications.

- The fact that asymmetric cryptography is mentioned specifically, and it's a known technique in the ATT&CK framework, suggests that this is a common approach used by malware authors.

But, the question is asking if it's likely that both NetFlash and PyFlash use HTTPS with asymmetric cryptography for their C&C communications.

Let's consider a few points:

1. **Consistency between malware variants**: If NetFlash and PyFlash are related malware families, it's possible that they share similar communication mechanisms.

2. **Effectiveness of HTTPS for evasion**: Using HTTPS can help malware avoid detection by security products that might not inspect encrypted traffic thoroughly.

3. **Complexity of implementation**: Implementing HTTPS with asymmetric cryptography is standard in many programming languages, so it's not particularly difficult for malware authors to incorporate.

4. **Observations in the wild**: Without specific intelligence on NetFlash and PyFlash, it's hard to say definitively, but given that the use of encrypted C&C channels is common, it's a reasonable assumption.

However, the question mentions that PyFlash backdoor gathers OS-related information and sends it to the C&C server after infection. It doesn't specify how this communication is encrypted or which protocol is used.

Moreover, the question is about whether both NetFlash and PyFlash use HTTPS with asymmetric cryptography for their C&C communications.

Given that we have related TTPs indicating the use of asymmetric cryptography in command and control, it's reasonable to assume that both malware families might employ this technique.

But, I need to be careful here. The question is asking about the likelihood based on the provided information.

Let me think about it differently:

- The question provides information about PyFlash gathering OS info and sending it to C&C.

- It then asks about both NetFlash and PyFlash using HTTPS with asymmetric cryptography for C&C communications.

- The related TTPs confirm that asymmetric cryptography is used in command and control.

Given this, it seems plausible that both malware families use HTTPS with asymmetric cryptography for their C&C communications.

However, the question is phrased in a way that seems to suggest there might be a catch or additional considerations.

Let me consider some counterpoints:

1. **Variation in malware capabilities**: Even if related, different malware families might have different communication mechanisms.

2. **Use of other encryption methods**: While asymmetric cryptography is mentioned, malware might use other encryption methods or even plain HTTP.

3. **Specific intelligence on NetFlash and PyFlash**: Without specific CTI reports on these malware families, I'm making assumptions based on general knowledge.

But, given that the related TTPs specifically mention the use of asymmetric cryptography in command and control, it's likely that this is a technique employed by these malware families.

Therefore, considering all this, I think the answer is "Yes," it is likely that both NetFlash and PyFlash use HTTPS with asymmetric cryptography for their C&C communications.
