Alright, I've got this question about FIN13's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). FIN13 is a known threat actor group, and from what I understand, they use various sophisticated methods to carry out their cyber operations. The question is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that FIN13 employs passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE. BLUEAGAVE is a type of backdoor that sets up a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports. This means it's listening for incoming HTTP requests and can execute commands based on those requests. So, it's a way for the attackers to maintain access to the compromised system remotely.

Next, the question asks whether, after using BLUEAGAVE, it's likely that FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Okay, let's unpack this. It seems like there's a sequence of events here:

1. FIN13 uses BLUEAGAVE to set up a local HTTP server for command and control.

2. Then, they might use other tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to establish persistence on the system.

3. After that, they might exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.

Wait a second, this seems a bit confusing. Typically, in a cyber attack, the initial access happens first, followed by establishing persistence, and then further lateral movement and data exfiltration. So, the sequence mentioned in the question seems a bit out of the usual order.

Let me think about this again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the sequence.

The question says: "is it likely that they will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries?"

So, it's suggesting that after establishing persistence using SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass, they then use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.

Hmm, that doesn't make complete sense because initial access should come before persistence, right? Maybe I need to re-examine the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the "initial access" part is referring to accessing the system initially through the web shells deployed on external servers. But that seems convoluted.

Let me look at the answer choices: A: Yes and B: No. I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the attack sequence described.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols

- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003 - Web Shell

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels

These are from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors.

So, T1071.001 is using web protocols for command and control, which aligns with BLUEAGAVE's use of HTTP for communication.

T1505.003 is using web shells for persistence, which might relate to deploying web shells on external servers.

T1104 is about using multiple stages for command and control communications, which could involve moving from one communication channel to another.

Given these related TTPs, I need to see how they fit into the sequence described in the question.

Let me try to outline a plausible sequence based on my knowledge of cyber operations and the MITRE framework.

1. Initial Access: The threat actor gains initial access to the target network, perhaps through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, etc.

2. Execution: They execute their payloads, which could include backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.

3. Persistence: To maintain access over time, they establish persistence mechanisms, such as using SIXPACK or trojanized software like KeePass.

4. Command and Control: They set up command and control channels, possibly using web protocols like HTTP, as seen with BLUEAGAVE.

5. Privilege Escalation: If needed, they escalate their privileges within the network.

6. Defense Evasion: They take steps to avoid detection, such as using encryption for C2 communications or hiding their malware.

7. Credential Access: They may steal credentials to gain access to more systems.

8. Lateral Movement: They move laterally within the network to access more valuable data or systems.

9. Collection: They collect the data they're after.

10. Exfiltration: They exfiltrate the data out of the network.

Now, the question is focusing on the sequence after BLUEAGAVE is deployed. So, assuming that BLUEAGAVE is already in place for command and control, the next steps might involve establishing additional persistence mechanisms or expanding access.

The question mentions that after using BLUEAGAVE, they might exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access, but only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Wait, this still seems off. If they've already established persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass, why would they need to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access later on? Initial access should have already been achieved at this point.

Maybe the question is trying to say that after establishing initial persistence with BLUEAGAVE and other tools, they then look to use external servers to deploy web shells for additional persistence or as a fallback method.

That would make more sense. So, perhaps the sequence is:

- Initial access is gained through some method.

- They deploy BLUEAGAVE for command and control.

- They establish persistence using SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

- Then, to further ensure their access, they exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.

In this case, the web shells on external servers would serve as an additional persistence mechanism, separate from the internal systems they've already compromised.

Given this interpretation, it seems plausible that after establishing initial persistence internally, they would look to establish external persistence points as well. This is a common tactic to have multiple entry points into the network, in case one is discovered and mitigated.

Looking back at the related TTPs:

- Using web protocols for C2 (T1071.001) is already being done with BLUEAGAVE.

- Using web shells for persistence (T1505.003) aligns with deploying web shells on external servers.

- Using multi-stage channels (T1104) suggests that they might be setting up multiple layers of communication channels for redundancy and evasion.

So, from this perspective, it does make sense that after establishing internal persistence, they would set up external web shells as additional persistence mechanisms.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes, it is likely that they will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Wait a minute, but in this scenario, the web shells on external servers wouldn't necessarily be for "initial access" at this stage, since initial access has already been achieved and persistence established internally. Instead, they would be for maintaining or reinforcing their access.

Maybe there's a miswording in the question. Perhaps it's meant to say that they use external web shells for additional access points rather than "initial access."

Alternatively, maybe the external web shells are intended to be used for initial access in future operations, but after setting up internal persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

In any case, given the related TTPs and the general tactics used by sophisticated threat groups, it is plausible that they would set up external web shells as part of their persistence strategy.

Therefore, I think the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
