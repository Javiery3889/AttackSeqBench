Alright, I've got this question about cybersecurity, specifically about some malicious activities related to OT capabilities and data destruction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions something called 'IPsec Helper' that's waiting for commands from C2 servers. C2 stands for command and control, which is how attackers communicate with the malware they've installed on victims' systems. So, 'IPsec Helper' seems to be a piece of malware or a tool that's sitting on the victim's system, ready to receive instructions from the attackers.

The question then asks whether, after receiving these commands, Agrius—presumably the attacker or the attack group—is likely to deploy something called CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities, as well as mapped drives and physical drive partitions, as part of their data destruction activities.

OT stands for operational technology, which is technology that controls and monitors physical devices, processes, and industrial equipment. So, files related to OT capabilities are probably critical for operating industrial systems.

Now, the answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No," so I need to decide based on the information provided and my knowledge of cybersecurity whether this sequence of events is plausible.

The related TTPs provided are:

1. Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485 - Data Destruction

2. Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002 - Disk Structure Wipe

TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, which are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework that categorizes different kinds of cyber threats and behaviors.

So, T1485 is Data Destruction, which involves actions designed to damage or delete data, often to render it unusable or to prevent its recovery. T1561.002 is Disk Structure Wipe, which is a specific method of data destruction where the disk's structure is overwritten, making data recovery very difficult.

Given that, it seems like the attackers are interested in not just deleting files but also wiping the disk structures, which aligns with these techniques.

Now, let's look at the sequence of events:

1. 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

2. Upon receiving commands, it sends recon information or downloads files.

3. After that, Agrius deploys CaddyWiper to wipe specific files and disk structures.

Does this sequence make sense?

Well, 'IPsec Helper' seems to be an initial access or persistence mechanism. It's there to receive commands and carry out actions like sending reconnaissance data or downloading additional payloads.

CaddyWiper appears to be a wiper malware, designed to destroy data. Wiper malware is known for its ability to cause significant damage by deleting or overwriting critical data and files.

Given that, it's plausible that after gaining access and performing initial reconnaissance or other activities, the attackers would then deploy a wiper like CaddyWiper to carry out destructive actions.

Moreover, the fact that it targets files related to OT capabilities suggests that the attackers might be interested in disrupting industrial operations, possibly as part of a targeted attack against critical infrastructure.

Also, wiping mapped drives and physical drive partitions would further ensure that a broad range of data is destroyed, causing maximum disruption.

Looking back at the related TTPs, Data Destruction and Disk Structure Wipe are directly relevant to the actions described in the question.

Therefore, based on this analysis, it seems likely that after the 'IPsec Helper' carries out its initial tasks, Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper to perform data destruction activities as described.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

Wait a minute, but the question says "is Agrius likely to deploy CaddyWiper...?" and the answer choices are "Yes" or "No." Given the analysis, "Yes" seems appropriate, but I should consider if there's any reason to doubt this conclusion.

Is there any information that suggests otherwise? Not really. The related TTPs support the idea that data destruction is part of their modus operandi. The sequence of events—from initial access via 'IPsec Helper' to deploying a wiper like CaddyWiper—seems logical in the context of a destructive cyberattack.

Therefore, I don't see any reason to choose "No."

Hence, the final answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
