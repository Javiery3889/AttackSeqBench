Alright, I've got this question about cybersecurity, specifically about whether a certain sequence of tactics and techniques is plausible in an attack scenario involving the BlackEnergy 3 malware. I need to choose between "Yes" and "No" based on the information provided and my knowledge of cybersecurity practices, particularly focusing on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Reconnaissance Activities**: The attacker gathers publicly available information on systems and conducts active discovery methods. This falls under the **Discovery** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique T1497.002 - User Activity Based Checks. This means the attacker is monitoring or checking user activities to gather intelligence.

2. **Malicious Implants**: The specific malware mentioned is BlackEnergy 3. I know that BlackEnergy is a type of malware that has been used in various cyber attacks, particularly those aimed at disrupting industrial control systems.

3. **Ruby Scripts for Payload Execution**: The question suggests that after being installed on the network, the malware uses Ruby scripts to execute payloads.

4. **Installation Through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution**: The malware is installed on the network through macros enabled by employees, likely via phishing emails or similar social engineering tactics.

Now, I need to evaluate whether it's likely that BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed via macro execution.

Let me consider each part of this sequence:

- **Reconnaissance and Discovery**: This is a standard initial step in many cyber attacks. Attackers gather information about their target to plan their attack more effectively. The technique T1497.002 - User Activity Based Checks makes sense in this context, as it helps attackers understand when it's safe to perform certain actions without being detected.

- **Malware Installation via Macro Execution**: This is a common method for malware distribution. Attackers often exploit human error by tricking employees into enabling macros in documents, which then execute malicious code. This aligns with the technique T1193 - Macro Execution in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- **Using Ruby Scripts for Payload Execution**: This is the part I need to verify. I need to check if BlackEnergy 3 is known to use Ruby scripts as part of its execution process.

I recall that BlackEnergy 3 is primarily associated with Python and PowerShell scripts for its operations, especially in the context of the Ukrainian power grid attack in 2015. I don't recall it using Ruby scripts specifically. However, malware authors can use various scripting languages depending on the environment and the capabilities they need.

To make an informed decision, I should consider the following:

- **Common Practices**: In the cybersecurity field, it's known that attackers often use scripting languages like Python, PowerShell, and Visual Basic for scripting (VBS) because these languages are commonly present on Windows systems and can perform a wide range of tasks.

- **Specific to BlackEnergy 3**: I need to recall or look up if BlackEnergy 3 has been observed using Ruby scripts. Since I don't have immediate access to external resources, I'll rely on my knowledge.

- **Plausibility**: Even if BlackEnergy 3 hasn't been observed using Ruby scripts, is it plausible that it could? Ruby is a scripting language that can be used for malicious purposes, but it's less common in Windows environments compared to PowerShell or VBS.

Given that the related TTPs mention Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002 - User Activity Based Checks and Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic, it seems that the context is more aligned with Visual Basic scripting rather than Ruby.

Moreover, the question mentions that the malware is installed through employee-enabled macro execution, which is typically associated with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros in Microsoft Office documents.

Considering all this, it's less likely that BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts for payload execution in this scenario. It's more plausible that it would use PowerShell, Python, or even Visual Basic scripts, given the context.

Therefore, my answer would be "No," it is not likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Final Answer: B: No**
