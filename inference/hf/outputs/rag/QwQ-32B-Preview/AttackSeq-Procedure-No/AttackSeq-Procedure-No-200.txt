Alright, I've got this question about the GreyEnergy group and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The question is: after compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials, will the GreyEnergy group use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network? And the answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context here. GreyEnergy is a known cyber threat group, and they've already compromised a system using their malware, GreyEnergy mini. They've used Nmap for network mapping and Mimikatz for credential harvesting. Now, the question is whether they would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker (which is likely a ransomware) and other tools across the network.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018 - Remote System Discovery

This indicates that the threat group is interested in discovering other systems within the network, which aligns with their use of Nmap for mapping the network.

2. Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer

This suggests that the group is looking to move laterally within the network by transferring tools from one system to another.

3. Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools

This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious payloads.

Given these TTPs, I need to evaluate whether using PDQ Deploy for lateral movement makes sense in this context.

First, let's consider what PDQ Deploy is. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool used by system administrators to deploy software and updates across a network. It's a legitimate tool, but like many administrative tools, it can be abused by attackers for malicious purposes.

Now, considering that the GreyEnergy group has already compromised a system and has access to credentials (thanks to Mimikatz), it's possible that they could abuse PDQ Deploy if it's present in the network.

But, I need to think about whether this is plausible and aligns with their known TTPs.

From the related TTPs, they are already using techniques related to discovery and lateral movement. Using a software deployment tool like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement would fit under the Execution tactic, specifically Technique T1072.

So, in theory, it's possible. But is it likely?

I need to consider a few factors:

1. **Presence of PDQ Deploy in the target network:** Not all networks use PDQ Deploy. If the target network doesn't use this tool, then the attackers can't abuse it.

2. **Access to PDQ Deploy:** Even if PDQ Deploy is present, the attackers need to have the necessary permissions to use it. Since they've already harvested credentials, it's possible they have the required access.

3. **Stealth and Avoidance:** Using legitimate administrative tools can help attackers blend in with normal network traffic, making their activities less conspicuous.

4. **Effectiveness:** Whether PDQ Deploy is an effective tool for moving malware across the network.

5. **Known Usage:** Is there any known evidence or reports that the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy for lateral movement?

Regarding the first point, since the question doesn't specify whether PDQ Deploy is present in the network, I have to assume that it might be present, as the question is considering its use.

Second, since they've used Mimikatz to collect credentials, it's possible they have the necessary permissions to use PDQ Deploy.

Third, using legitimate tools for malicious purposes is a common tactic in cyber attacks, as it helps avoid detection.

Fourth, PDQ Deploy is designed to deploy software across a network, which aligns well with the need to move malware like AvosLocker and other tools.

Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, I need to consider whether there's any known indication that GreyEnergy uses PDQ Deploy. However, since I don't have real-time threat intelligence and this seems like a hypothetical scenario, I'll have to base my answer on the provided information and general knowledge of APT tactics.

Given that, I need to decide between "Yes" and "No."

If I choose "Yes," I'm asserting that it's plausible for GreyEnergy to use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement, given the related TTPs.

If I choose "No," I'm suggesting that, based on the information provided, it's unlikely or not a part of their TTPs.

Considering that the related TTPs include lateral tool transfer and using software deployment tools, which PDQ Deploy falls under, it seems reasonable to conclude that yes, they might use PDQ Deploy for this purpose.

However, I should also consider alternative methods of lateral movement that are more commonly associated with APT groups. For example, techniques like Pass-the-Hash, SMB exploitation, or using native tools like PowerShell for lateral movement are very common.

Perhaps the use of PDQ Deploy is less common, but not impossible. In fact, using administrative tools like PDQ Deploy can be seen as a sophisticated tactic, as it leverages legitimate pathways for movement.

Moreover, the question mentions moving "AvosLocker and tools across the network," which aligns well with the capability of PDQ Deploy to distribute software.

Therefore, considering all these factors, I think the most plausible answer is "Yes," they would use PDQ Deploy for this purpose.

But to be thorough, let's consider why "No" might be a possible answer.

One reason could be that PDQ Deploy might not be present in all networks, or the attackers may not have the necessary access to use it, even with harvested credentials. Additionally, relying on a specific tool might not be as flexible as using more universal lateral movement techniques.

However, since the question sets up a scenario where they've already used Nmap and Mimikatz, and the related TTPs include lateral tool transfer and using software deployment tools, it seems consistent that they would use PDQ Deploy if available.

In conclusion, based on the provided information and the alignment with the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
