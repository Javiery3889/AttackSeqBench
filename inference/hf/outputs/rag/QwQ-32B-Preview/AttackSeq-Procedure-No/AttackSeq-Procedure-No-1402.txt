Alright, I've got this question about FIN13's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in cyber attacks, specifically focusing on their use of certain methods for lateral movement and data collection. I need to determine if it's likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network after performing internal reconnaissance.

First, let's break down the question and understand what's being asked. The sequence of events described is:

1. FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during the discovery phase.

2. Following this, they are considered for using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.

3. Finally, they collect data from network shared drives and target specific information for fraudulent transactions.

I need to assess whether this sequence is plausible, specifically focusing on the use of PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after reconnaissance.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

My task is to decide between these two based on the information provided and my knowledge of cyber threat intelligence and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Now, let's look at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools

- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083 - File and Directory Discovery

These related TTPs give me context about the techniques involved in lateral movement and discovery, which are central to the question.

Starting with the discovery phase, T1083 - File and Directory Discovery is mentioned. This technique involves adversaries looking for specific information within a compromised system by accessing and reviewing file systems and directories. This aligns with the initial step of internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware.

Next, the question moves to lateral movement, where FIN13 is considered to use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to transfer AvosLocker and other tools across the network. T1072 - Software Deployment Tools corresponds to this action, as it involves using legitimate software deployment tools to spread malware or tools within a network.

Additionally, T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer is relevant, as it specifically refers to the transfer of tools from one system to another for lateral movement.

Given this, I need to evaluate if it's likely for FIN13 to follow this sequence:

1. Perform discovery using native OS binaries and custom malware.

2. Use software deployment tools for lateral movement.

3. Collect data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions.

To do this, I should consider whether this sequence makes sense from a threat actor's perspective and whether there are any red flags or inconsistencies in the approach.

First, using native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery is a common tactic. Native binaries help avoid detection, as they are part of the operating system, and custom malware can be tailored to specific objectives.

After discovery, lateral movement is a natural next step for threat actors aiming to expand their access within a network. Using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for this purpose is plausible because these tools are designed to distribute software across multiple systems, which can be repurposed by attackers to spread their malware.

PDQ Deploy, in particular, is a legitimate tool used for software deployment in enterprise environments. If compromised, it could be used by attackers to quickly and efficiently distribute malware to multiple systems, bypassing some of the manual steps involved in lateral movement.

Following lateral movement, collecting data from network shared drives makes sense, as these drives often contain sensitive information that can be exploited for fraudulent activities.

Now, considering the specific threat group mentioned, FIN13. FIN13 is known for its cybercrime activities, particularly involving financial fraud and ransomware attacks. AvosLocker is a ransomware variant, so it aligns with FIN13's modus operandi.

Given that, using software deployment tools to spread AvosLocker and other tools seems consistent with their objectives to maximize impact and profitability by infecting as many systems as possible.

However, I should also consider whether relying on software deployment tools for lateral movement is typical for FIN13. According to available threat intelligence, FIN13 is known to use a variety of techniques for lateral movement, including credential dumping, remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploitation, and other methods outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

While T1072 - Software Deployment Tools is a recognized technique, I need to verify if FIN13 has been observed using this method in their operations. Unfortunately, without access to the latest threat reports or specific intelligence on FIN13's tactics, I have to rely on general knowledge and the plausibility of the scenario.

Considering that software deployment tools are prevalent in enterprise environments and that threat actors often look for efficient ways to spread their malware, it's reasonable to assume that FIN13 could utilize such tools if available and accessible to them.

Moreover, the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes, also known as living off the land, is a common strategy among threat actors to blend in with normal network activity and avoid detection.

Therefore, the sequence described seems plausible:

- Perform discovery using native and custom tools.

- Use software deployment tools for lateral movement to spread AvosLocker and other tools.

- Collect data from network shares for fraudulent transactions.

This sequence aligns with established threat actor behaviors and the techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the analysis above, it is likely that FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after performing internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A**
