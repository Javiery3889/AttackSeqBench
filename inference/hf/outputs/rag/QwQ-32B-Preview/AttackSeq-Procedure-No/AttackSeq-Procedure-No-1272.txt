Alright, I've got this question about WastedLocker ransomware and its behavior in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question is: After WastedLocker is deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the Defense Evasion phase, is it likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase?

And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to decide between these two options based on the information provided and my knowledge of ransomware behaviors and the MITRE framework.

Let's start by understanding the phases mentioned here: Defense Evasion and Impact. These are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes cyber threat actor behaviors.

Defense Evasion is a tactic where adversaries try to prevent detection and avoid security controls. In this phase, WastedLocker is deployed using PsExec, which is a legitimate administration tool by Microsoft, to stop services and disable Windows Defender. This sounds like typical defense evasion techniques where the attacker is trying to avoid being caught by disabling security software and stopping processes that might interfere with their activities.

Now, the question is about what happens in the Impact phase. The Impact tactic in MITRE ATT&CK involves actions that result in a denial of service or data destruction, directly impacting the availability of resources for the victim.

The specific technique mentioned in the related TTPs is T1490: Inhibit System Recovery. This technique involves actions that prevent or hinder the recovery of systems or data, making it harder or impossible for the victim to restore their systems without paying the ransom.

So, the question is whether WastedLocker is likely to delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in this Impact phase.

Volume shadow copies are backups created by Windows for files and folders, which can be used to restore previous versions of files. Ransomware often targets these shadow copies because if they are deleted, it limits the victim's ability to recover files without paying the ransom.

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell developed by Microsoft, commonly used by administrators and, unfortunately, by attackers for executing commands and scripts on Windows systems.

Given that WastedLocker is a ransomware known for its sophistication, it's plausible that it would employ techniques to delete shadow copies to maximize the impact on the victim.

But let's think about this carefully. The question is not just whether ransomware in general deletes shadow copies, but specifically whether, after performing certain actions in the Defense Evasion phase, it's likely to delete shadow copies in the Impact phase.

From the MITRE ATT&CK framework, T1490: Inhibit System Recovery includes sub-techniques such as Modifying System Recovery Options and Removing System Backup Files or Shadow Copies. So, deleting shadow copies falls under this category.

Moreover, using PowerShell to delete shadow copies is a common method because PowerShell provides a straightforward way to interact with the Windows API and perform system-level operations.

So, considering that WastedLocker has already performed defense evasion techniques like stopping services and disabling Windows Defender, it makes sense that in the Impact phase, it would proceed to delete shadow copies to ensure that the victim cannot easily recover their files without paying the ransom.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes, it is likely that WastedLocker will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

But to be thorough, let's consider why B: No might not be the correct answer.

If I choose B: No, that would imply that WastedLocker does not delete shadow copies in the Impact phase. However, given that inhibiting system recovery is a common goal for ransomware to maximize the chances of the victim paying the ransom, it seems counterintuitive for a sophisticated ransomware like WastedLocker to skip this step.

Additionally, the related TTPs specifically mention T1490: Inhibit System Recovery, which includes deleting shadow copies. Therefore, choosing B: No would contradict the expected behavior of such ransomware.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the understanding of ransomware tactics, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

Final Answer: A
