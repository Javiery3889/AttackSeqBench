Alright, I've got this question about a group called FamousSparrow and their tactics in cyber attacks. The question is asking whether it's likely that this group will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after they've dumped credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access. The answer choices are simply Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the context here. FamousSparrow is presumably a threat actor group, and they're using certain techniques in their attacks. The question is focusing on the sequence of their tactics, specifically whether they perform Discovery activities only after Credential Access.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082 - System Information Discovery

- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003 - OS Credential Dumping

So, Discovery involves gathering information about the system, and Credential Access involves obtaining credentials, in this case, using a custom version of Mimikatz, which is a tool known for dumping credentials from memory.

Now, the question is about the sequence: does Discovery happen only after Credential Access?

To answer this, I need to think about the typical kill chain in cyber attacks and how these tactics usually unfold.

Generally, in a cyber attack, the initial stages involve Reconnaissance, followed by Initial Access, then Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and finally, Discovery and Lateral Movement.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me recall the MITRE ATT&CK framework's phases.

The standard sequence in the MITRE ATT&CK framework is:

1. Reconnaissance

2. Initial Access

3. Execution

4. Persistence

5. Privilege Escalation

6. Defense Evasion

7. Credential Access

8. Discovery

9. Lateral Movement

10. Collection

11. Exfiltration

12. Command and Control

So, according to this, Discovery comes after Credential Access.

But is this a strict sequence? Do threat actors always follow this exact order?

Not necessarily. While the MITRE framework provides a structured sequence, actual attack patterns can vary. Some groups might perform certain tactics out of order or even concurrently.

In this specific case, the question is asking whether FamousSparrow collects system information and probes files as part of Discovery only after dumping credentials.

Given that Credential Access is listed before Discovery in the MITRE sequence, it's plausible that threat actors would first gain access and escalate privileges before conducting broad Discovery activities.

However, I should consider whether Discovery activities might occur earlier in the attack chain.

Actually, in many attacks, initial Discovery activities happen early on, even before Credential Access, to understand the environment and decide on the next steps.

For example, an attacker might gain initial access to a system and then immediately start discovering information about the system and network to plan further actions, which may include Credential Access.

So, it's possible that Discovery occurs before Credential Access.

But the question specifies whether Discovery happens only after Credential Access.

Given that, if Discovery can happen before Credential Access, then the answer should be No, it's not likely that Discovery only occurs after Credential Access.

Wait, but maybe in this specific group's modus operandi, they prioritize Credential Access first.

The related TTPs mention T1082 System Information Discovery and T1003 OS Credential Dumping.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK website, T1082 is part of the Discovery tactic, and T1003 is part of Credential Access.

Typically, Credential Access would come after initial Discovery to some extent, as the attacker needs to know where to look for credentials.

But it's also possible that after gaining initial access, the attacker dumps credentials immediately to see what they can get, and then uses those credentials for further Discovery.

Alternatively, they might perform some Discovery to identify where credentials are stored and then perform Credential Access.

It's a bit nuanced.

Given that the question specifies that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of Discovery only after dumping credentials, I need to assess whether this sequence is likely.

Considering that Credential Access often requires some level of Discovery to know where to look or what permissions are needed, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to perform Discovery only after Credential Access.

Moreover, in many attack scenarios, initial Discovery is crucial for understanding the environment and deciding on the next steps, which may include when and how to perform Credential Access.

Therefore, it's likely that Discovery activities occur before or concurrently with Credential Access, not strictly after.

Hence, the answer should be No, it's not likely that FamousSparrow will perform Discovery only after Credential Access.

But I should consider if there are any specific reasons why this group might deviate from the norm.

The fact that they're using a custom version of Mimikatz suggests that they have specialized tools for Credential Access, which might indicate that they prioritize credential dumping early in their attack cycle.

However, even if they prioritize Credential Access, it's still probable that some level of Discovery occurs beforehand to inform their actions.

Moreover, dumping credentials might be one of the first actions they perform after gaining access to maintain persistence or move laterally, but they would still need to discover the system's configuration to effectively use those credentials.

Therefore, while Credential Access might be prioritized, Discovery activities are likely to be interleaved or performed in parallel.

Given this analysis, it's not likely that Discovery only occurs after Credential Access.

So, the answer should be No.

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
