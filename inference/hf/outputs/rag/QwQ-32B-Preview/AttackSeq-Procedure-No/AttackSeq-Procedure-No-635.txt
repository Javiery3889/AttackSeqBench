Alright, I've got this question about a cyber attack that involved malicious JavaScript code on a Korean-language news portal. The attack used a vulnerability in Google Chrome, specifically CVE-2019-13720, to exploit victims. The question is asking whether, before this exploit was used, attackers likely utilized heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute shellcode.

First, I need to understand the context here. The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" with "T1189 - Drive-by Compromise" and "Execution" with "T1059.007 - JavaScript." So, it seems like the attack started with a drive-by compromise, probably through the news portal, and then used JavaScript for execution.

Let's break down the question. It's asking about whether heap spraying was likely used before the exploit code was inserted. Heap spraying is a technique where attackers fill memory (the heap) with their code so that, when a vulnerability is triggered, it's more likely to jump to their code and execute it.

CVE-2019-13720 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome. Use-after-free vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain control over the program's execution flow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Attackers compromise the news portal with malicious JavaScript.

2. This JavaScript likely contains exploit code for CVE-2019-13720.

3. The exploit code triggers the vulnerability and, if successful, executes the shellcode.

Now, the question is whether heap spraying was used before this exploit code was inserted to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute the shellcode.

Heap spraying is often used in exploit chains, especially when dealing with memory corruption vulnerabilities like use-after-free bugs. The purpose is to increase the chances of the exploit succeeding by making the memory layout more predictable.

In this case, the attackers are exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome using malicious JavaScript. So, they're likely crafting their exploit specifically for this vulnerability.

I need to consider whether heap spraying would be necessary or likely in this scenario.

First, heap spraying can be used to place the shellcode in a known memory location, making it easier for the exploit to jump to that location after gaining control of the execution flow.

However, modern browsers like Google Chrome have various security mechanisms in place, such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), which randomizes memory addresses to prevent attackers from reliably jumping to specific memory locations.

Heap spraying can help overcome ASLR by filling a large portion of memory with the shellcode, increasing the chances that the execution flow will land in the sprayed code.

But, with modern browsers employing ASLR and other exploit mitigations, heap spraying might not be as effective as it used to be. Additionally, heap spraying can be resource-intensive and may raise red flags, as it involves allocating large amounts of memory.

Given that the attackers are targeting a specific vulnerability, it's possible that they developed a more targeted exploit that doesn't rely on heap spraying.

Moreover, the question mentions "gaining an arbitrary read/write primitive." This suggests that the exploit might involve achieving memory read and write capabilities before executing the shellcode.

In exploit development, gaining a read/write primitive is often a step towards achieving arbitrary code execution. This can be done through various techniques, such as use-after-free vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to reuse freed memory blocks to manipulate object references.

So, in the case of CVE-2019-13720, a use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome, attackers might be able to manipulate memory references to gain control over certain objects, leading to arbitrary read/write capabilities.

Once they have arbitrary read/write, they can then prepare the execution flow to jump to their shellcode.

Now, does this sequence require heap spraying?

Not necessarily. If the exploit for CVE-2019-13720 already provides a reliable way to execute code, heap spraying might not be needed.

Heap spraying is more of a fallback method when precise control over the execution flow is difficult to achieve.

Given that the attackers are inserting malicious JavaScript into a news portal, which is then redirecting victims to an exploit landing page, it's likely that they have crafted a targeted exploit for CVE-2019-13720.

Therefore, it's possible that they didn't need to use heap spraying and instead relied on the exploit to directly execute the shellcode.

Additionally, using heap spraying might make the exploit more conspicuous and could be detected by security mechanisms.

So, considering all this, I would say that it's not likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.

Hence, the answer should be "No."

Wait a minute, but the question is a bit tricky. It says, "before malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, is it likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques..."

Hmm, so the insertion of malicious JavaScript is separate from the exploit landing page. The news portal is used to redirect victims to the exploit landing page, which then exploits CVE-2019-13720.

So, the sequence is:

1. Attackers compromise the news portal with malicious JavaScript.

2. This JavaScript redirects victims to the exploit landing page.

3. The exploit landing page contains the exploit for CVE-2019-13720.

So, the heap spraying, if used, would be part of the exploit landing page's exploit code, not part of the initial JavaScript insertion.

Wait, but the question is about whether attackers utilized heap spraying techniques before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's re-read the question.

"Before malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, is it likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload?"

So, it's asking about whether heap spraying was used before the insertion of the malicious JavaScript code that redirects to the exploit landing page.

Wait, but the heap spraying would be part of the exploit landing page's activities, not part of the initial compromise of the news portal.

Unless the insertion of the malicious JavaScript itself required some kind of heap spraying, which doesn't make much sense in this context.

Probably, the question is trying to ask whether heap spraying was used as part of the exploit for CVE-2019-13720.

But the way it's phrased, it's asking about actions before the insertion of the malicious JavaScript.

This seems a bit muddled.

Alternatively, maybe the attackers used heap spraying as part of their initial access vector.

But the related TTPs mention "Initial Access" with "T1189 - Drive-by Compromise" and "Execution" with "T1059.007 - JavaScript."

So, the initial access is through a drive-by compromise using JavaScript.

Given that, it's unlikely that heap spraying was used before inserting the malicious JavaScript.

Heap spraying is more of an exploitation technique used after gaining some level of code execution, to facilitate further exploitation.

Wait, but the question is about whether heap spraying was used before inserting the malicious JavaScript.

This seems odd because heap spraying is typically used during the exploitation phase, not during the initial compromise.

Maybe the question intended to ask whether heap spraying was used as part of the exploit landing page's activities.

Alternatively, perhaps there was an intermediate step where heap spraying was used to gain more privileges before executing the final payload.

But, given the confusion in the question's phrasing, I'll assume it's asking whether heap spraying was likely used as part of the exploit for CVE-2019-13720.

Given that, and considering the points I made earlier about the necessity and effectiveness of heap spraying in modern browsers with security mitigations like ASLR, I still think that it's not likely that attackers used heap spraying in this scenario.

Therefore, the answer should be "No."

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are any specific reasons why heap spraying might have been used here.

CVE-2019-13720 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome. Use-after-free vulnerabilities can be tricky to exploit, especially in a controlled and reliable manner.

Attackers might use heap spraying as a way to make the exploit more reliable by increasing the chances of the execution flow landing in the sprayed memory.

However, given that Chrome has ASLR enabled, heap spraying might not be sufficiently reliable.

Alternatively, attackers might have developed a more sophisticated exploit that doesn't rely on heap spraying.

Moreover, considering the specific nature of the vulnerability and the fact that it's a use-after-free bug, it's possible that the exploit already provides a way to control the execution flow without needing heap spraying.

Therefore, I believe that heap spraying was not likely used in this attack sequence.

Hence, the answer is "No."

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
