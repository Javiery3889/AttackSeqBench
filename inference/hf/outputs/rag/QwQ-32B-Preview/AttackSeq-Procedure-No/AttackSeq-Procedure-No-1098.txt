Alright, I've got this question about CosmicDuke and its behavior regarding data compression and exfiltration. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that CosmicDuke searches removable drives and skips certain file types during collection. Then it asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to compress output data generated by command execution with a custom implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

The answer choices are simply "A: Yes" and "B: No." So, I need to decide between these two based on the information provided and my knowledge of cybersecurity and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Now, let's look at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002 - Archive via Library

2. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method

These are specific sub-techniques under the broader technique T1560, which is "Archive Collected Data." So, it's clear that the question is focusing on how CosmicDuke handles data archiving before exfiltration.

Let's understand what these sub-techniques mean:

- T1560.002 - Archive via Library: This involves using standard libraries or APIs provided by the operating system or programming languages to compress and archive data.

- T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method: This refers to adversaries implementing their own methods for archiving and compressing data, rather than using standard libraries.

Given that, the question is asking if CosmicDuke is likely to use a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for compressing data before exfiltration via FTP.

To answer this, I need to consider a few factors:

1. **Adversary TTPs:** What is known about CosmicDuke's tactics, techniques, and procedures? Do they typically use custom methods for data compression, or do they rely on standard libraries?

2. **LZW Algorithm:** Is LZW a common choice for data compression in malware or APT activities? Are there any known instances where CosmicDuke or similar groups have used LZW?

3. **Exfiltration Method:** The question mentions exfiltration via FTP. Does the choice of exfiltration method influence the compression technique used?

4. **Context of Data Collection:** The question mentions searching removable drives and skipping certain file types. This suggests that the data being collected is selective, which might influence how it's compressed and exfiltrated.

Unfortunately, I don't have specific knowledge about CosmicDuke's tactics beyond what's provided in the question and the related TTPs. So, I need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge of APT groups and their behaviors.

First, APT groups often employ custom methods for data compression to avoid detection and to make their activities less recognizable. Using standard libraries can leave artifacts or patterns that defenders might identify, whereas custom methods can be more opaque.

Given that, the fact that one of the related TTPs is "Archive via Custom Method" suggests that CosmicDuke may indeed use custom implementations for archiving data.

Moreover, the question specifies that the custom implementation is of the LZW algorithm. LZW is a well-known compression algorithm, and implementing it customly isn't unheard of. Some malware does implement its own compression routines to reduce the size of exfiltrated data and to make network traffic less conspicuous.

On the other hand, using standard libraries for compression is also common, as it's easier and less error-prone. However, the related TTP points towards custom methods, which tips the scale towards option A: Yes, CosmicDuke is likely to compress output data with a custom implementation of LZW before exfiltration.

Additionally, exfiltrating data via FTP is a common method, and compressing data before exfiltration helps in reducing the amount of data transferred, which can be beneficial in avoiding detection, especially if the exfiltration is being monitored.

Considering all these factors, it seems plausible that CosmicDuke would use a custom implementation of LZW for compressing data before exfiltration via FTP.

Therefore, my answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
