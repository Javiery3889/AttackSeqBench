Alright, I've got this question about a cyber threat group called BRONZE PRESIDENT. They've compromised a network using phishing emails with LNK files and have achieved initial access. Now, the question is whether they're likely to use tools like Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery before escalating privileges using native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies. The answer choices are simply Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the context here. BRONZE PRESIDENT is a threat group, and they've already gotten into the network through phishing emails with LNK files. LNK files are basically Windows shortcut files that can contain malicious code, so that makes sense as an initial access vector.

Now, after gaining initial access, the next steps would typically involve understanding the network environment, identifying valuable targets, and then moving laterally to access those targets. This is where the discovery phase comes in.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018 - Remote System Discovery

2. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046 - Network Service Discovery

3. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1006 - Direct Volume Access

So, the discovery techniques are about mapping the network and finding systems of interest, while the defense evasion technique is about accessing data directly from storage devices, possibly to bypass security measures.

Given that, let's look at the tools mentioned in the question:

- Nmap: A network exploration tool and security scanner.

- Nbtscan: A tool to query the NetBIOS name service protocol to discover hosts and their NetBIOS names.

Both of these tools are commonly used for network reconnaissance to identify active hosts and the services they're running.

Then, for privilege escalation, the question mentions using native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies. Vssadmin is a command-line utility in Windows for managing volume shadow copies, which can be used to access previous versions of files, including those that might contain sensitive information or be useful for privilege escalation.

So, putting it all together, the sequence is:

1. Initial access through phishing LNK files.

2. Use of Nmap and Nbtscan to discover network services and map the environment.

3. Use of vssadmin to create volume shadow copies on domain controllers for potential privilege escalation.

Now, is this a plausible sequence based on the related TTPs?

Well, the discovery techniques align with using Nmap and Nbtscan to map the network and find targets. T1018 - Remote System Discovery and T1046 - Network Service Discovery are both about understanding the network environment, which these tools facilitate.

Then, using vssadmin for privilege escalation ties into T1006 - Direct Volume Access, which is about accessing data directly from storage devices, possibly to bypass security measures or to access data not available through normal channels.

So, from a TTP perspective, this sequence makes sense. It follows a logical progression from initial access to discovery to privilege escalation, using tools that are consistent with the techniques listed.

But, I need to consider whether this is likely for BRONZE PRESIDENT specifically. The question provides some context about their past activities, such as using phishing emails with LNK files, which suggests they are capable of executing such a sequence.

However, without specific intelligence on BRONZE PRESIDENT's tactics, I have to rely on general threat group behavior. Many threat groups follow similar patterns: initial access, discovery, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and exfiltration.

Given that, it's plausible that BRONZE PRESIDENT would follow this sequence. Using Nmap and Nbtscan for discovery is common, and using native tools like vssadmin for privilege escalation is also a known technique.

Moreover, using native tools can help evade detection, as these tools are already present on the systems and are less likely to trigger security alerts compared to using external tools.

Therefore, based on the related TTPs and general threat group behavior, it seems likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT would employ this sequence of tools and techniques.

So, my answer would be Yes.
