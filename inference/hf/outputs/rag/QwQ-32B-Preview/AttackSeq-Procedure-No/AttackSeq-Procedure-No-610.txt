Alright, I've got this question about Hidden Cobra and their tactics. So, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is: after using Bankshot malware for reconnaissance, is it likely that Hidden Cobra would send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase? And I have two answer choices: A: Yes or B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No. To do that, I need to consider the context provided and the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

Let's start by breaking down the question. Hidden Cobra is a threat group, and they've been using Bankshot malware for reconnaissance. That means they're gathering information about their victims to plan their attacks better. Now, the question is whether, after this initial reconnaissance phase, they would proceed to send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials, still during the reconnaissance phase.

Hmm, so they've already used malware for reconnaissance and now they're possibly sending phishing messages to get more information, specifically credentials. Does that make sense in the context of the reconnaissance phase?

Well, reconnaissance is about gathering information, and harvesting credentials can be part of that because credentials can give them access to more information about the victim's network and systems. So, in that sense, it could be considered part of reconnaissance.

But, on the other hand, harvesting credentials is also a way to gain access to systems, which might be more related to the initial access phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. So, there might be some overlap here.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001 - Spearphishing via Service

2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656 - Impersonation

3. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.004 - Spearphishing via Voice

Okay, so these are the related techniques. Let's look them up in the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand them better.

First, T1598.001 - Spearphishing via Service. According to MITRE, this is a specific type of spearphishing where the attacker uses a trusted communication channel or service to deliver the phishing message. Telegram is a messaging service, so sending phishing messages through Telegram would fall under this technique.

Next, T1656 - Impersonation. This technique involves an attacker masquerading as another system, service, or user to gain trust and access. In this case, impersonating IT personnel is a form of impersonation to trick victims into providing their credentials.

Lastly, T1598.004 - Spearphishing via Voice. This is another variant of spearphishing where the attacker uses voice communication, like a phone call, to deceive the victim.

So, in the context of the question, Hidden Cobra is considering sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel, which aligns with T1598.001 - Spearphishing via Service and T1656 - Impersonation.

Now, is this likely during the reconnaissance phase? Well, reconnaissance is about gathering information, and harvesting credentials can be a way to get more information about the victim's environment. So, it makes sense that this could be part of the reconnaissance phase.

But, I need to think about the sequence of events. They've already used Bankshot malware for reconnaissance. Maybe they've gathered some information already, and now they want to get credentials to access more systems or data. So, it could be a continuation of the reconnaissance phase or possibly a step towards the initial access phase.

Let me consider the MITRE ATT&CK framework to see how these techniques are categorized.

Reconnaissance is the first stage, where adversaries gather information about their target. Techniques under this tactic include information from social media, public databases, and more.

Defense evasion is about the adversary trying to avoid detection by security solutions. Impersonation could be seen as a way to evade defenses by blending in with normal user behavior.

So, in this case, sending impersonated messages through Telegram could be seen as both reconnaissance (gathering information) and defense evasion (impersonation to avoid detection).

Given that, it's plausible that Hidden Cobra would use this method during the reconnaissance phase.

But, I need to think about whether it's likely, given that they've already used malware for reconnaissance.

Maybe they want to cast a wider net or target specific individuals within the organization. Impersonating IT personnel could be an effective way to trick users into providing their credentials, especially if the IT department is trusted.

Also, considering that Telegram is a popular messaging app, and many organizations use it for communication, using it for phishing makes sense.

Moreover, the fact that impersonation is a related TTP suggests that Hidden Cobra has used this technique before, so it's within their capabilities and modus operandi.

Therefore, it seems likely that they would proceed to send such messages during the reconnaissance phase.

But, to be thorough, I should consider why someone might choose No as an answer.

Perhaps because harvesting credentials is more related to the initial access phase rather than reconnaissance. In that perspective, reconnaissance is about gathering information without necessarily gaining access, whereas credential harvesting is a step towards gaining access.

Also, maybe using malware like Bankshot is sufficient for their reconnaissance needs, and they don't need to harvest credentials at this stage.

However, credentials can provide deeper insights into the victim's network and help identify high-value targets or sensitive information, which is valuable for both reconnaissance and planning the attack.

Given that, I think the benefits of harvesting credentials during reconnaissance outweigh the arguments against it.

Therefore, my answer would be Yes, it is likely that Hidden Cobra would send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
