Alright, I've got this question about CosmicDuke and its activities related to credential access and collection. The question is: After CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, is it likely that the malware captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts? And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand what CosmicDuke is. From my knowledge, CosmicDuke is a type of malware, likely used in cyber espionage or other malicious activities. It seems to be involved in targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, which falls under the category of data exfiltration or reconnaissance.

Now, the question is about whether it's likely that this malware captures credentials from a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page. Ivanti is a software company that provides IT management and security solutions, and Connect Secure is probably one of their products related to secure connections or remote access.

So, if CosmicDuke is manipulating the Ivanti Connect Secure login page to capture credentials, that sounds like an attempt to steal login information from users who are trying to access this secure platform.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003 - Web Portal Capture

2. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.003 - Web Portal Capture

3. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001 - Keylogging

These tactics and techniques are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversarial behaviors.

Credential Access is a tactic where adversaries try to obtain credentials to gain unauthorized access to resources. Web Portal Capture is a specific technique under this tactic where adversaries intercept credentials from web portals, likely through methods like phishing or manipulating login pages.

Collection is another tactic where adversaries gather information and exfiltrate it. Web Portal Capture and Keylogging are techniques under this tactic as well, indicating that adversaries may use these methods to collect data.

Given that CosmicDuke is already targeting files for discovery, which is a form of data collection, it seems plausible that it could also engage in credential access activities, especially if those credentials can provide access to more files or higher privileged areas.

The fact that there are related TTPs specifically mentioning Web Portal Capture suggests that this is a known technique used by adversaries, and CosmicDuke might be employing it.

Additionally, the presence of Keylogging as another collection technique indicates that adversaries may use multiple methods to capture credentials, including logging keystrokes to capture passwords as they are typed.

Considering all this, it seems likely that CosmicDuke could be capturing credentials from a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts.

But let's think about this step by step:

1. CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery. This suggests that it's already involved in data collection.

2. To gain access to more files or higher privileged areas, obtaining credentials could be a logical next step.

3. Manipulating a login page to capture credentials is a known technique, as indicated by the related TTPs.

4. Therefore, it's plausible that CosmicDuke is using this method to capture credentials.

However, I should also consider whether there's any information that might suggest otherwise. For example, maybe CosmicDuke is only focused on file discovery and doesn't engage in active credential harvesting. But given that credential access is a related tactic, it's likely that it does engage in such activities.

Moreover, the fact that both Credential Access and Collection tactics include the Web Portal Capture technique suggests that this is a multi-purpose technique that can serve both goals. Capturing credentials can help in accessing more data (Collection), and it can also be considered a direct attempt to acquire credentials (Credential Access).

Therefore, it makes sense that CosmicDuke would use this technique as part of its overall strategy.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, it is likely that CosmicDuke captures credentials from a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
