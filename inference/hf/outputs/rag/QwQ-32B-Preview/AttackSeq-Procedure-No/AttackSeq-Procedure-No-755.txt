Alright, I've got this question about a malware called Rising Sun. It's communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes. The question is asking whether, after doing that, it's likely that it performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. And there are two answer choices: A) Yes and B) No.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. So, Rising Sun is a type of malware, an implant, which means it's probably been installed on a target system, and it's communicating back to its operators through these HTTP POST requests. Command and control (C2) is a channel that malware uses to receive instructions from its operators and to send data back to them.

Now, the question is about whether it's likely that, as part of its operations, it performs initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. Reconnaissance typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand the system better, perhaps to identify valuable data or to find ways to move laterally within a network.

Looking at the answer choices, I have to decide between Yes and No. To make an informed decision, I should consider the nature of malware operations and the typical sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use.

Malware often follows a standard sequence of actions once it infects a system. First, it might establish persistence to ensure it continues to run even after system reboots. Then, it may perform reconnaissance to map the environment and gather information about the system and network it's operating in. This information can be useful for the attacker to plan further steps, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.

In this case, the malware is already communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, which suggests that it has already established a C2 channel. So, the question is whether, before or after setting up this C2 channel, it performs reconnaissance by collecting network and system information.

The related TTPs provided give some context. There are two related to the Discovery tactic: T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001 - Internet Connection Discovery. These techniques fall under the Discovery tactic, which is about the adversary trying to understand the environment they've infiltrated.

T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the network setup, such as IP addresses, DNS settings, routing configurations, etc. T1016.001 is a specific sub-technique that focuses on discovering whether the system has an internet connection.

Additionally, there's a related TTP under the Exfiltration tactic: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This refers to the practice of exfiltrating data through the same channel that's used for command and control communications.

Given this information, it seems that the malware is engaged in discovery activities, specifically looking into the network configuration and internet connection of the compromised system. These activities are typical for malware that needs to understand its environment before proceeding with further actions.

Now, the question mentions "decrypting and collecting network and system information." The term "decrypting" is interesting here because it suggests that the information being collected might be encrypted or that the malware is decrypting something to access this information.

However, in the context of system and network discovery, it's more common for malware to simply collect information that's available in plain sight, such as IP addresses, running processes, installed software, etc. Decryption might not necessarily be a part of this initial reconnaissance phase unless the system is using some form of encryption for its configurations or communications.

Given that, I need to consider whether it's likely that Rising Sun would perform decryption as part of its initial reconnaissance. If the system uses encrypted configurations or if there are encrypted files that contain relevant information, the malware might need to decrypt them to access the data.

But, in general, standard system and network discovery techniques don't inherently require decryption. So, while it's possible, it might not be a typical or necessary step for initial reconnaissance.

On the other hand, if the malware is designed to exfiltrate sensitive data, it might need to decrypt files or capture encrypted communications to access the data it's after. But that seems more related to the exfiltration phase rather than the initial reconnaissance.

Given that the related TTPs focus on discovery techniques like system network configuration discovery and internet connection discovery, it's more aligned with the malware collecting information about the network setup and whether the system is connected to the internet.

Therefore, it's plausible that after setting up the C2 channel, the malware performs these discovery activities to gather information about the network environment.

Now, considering the answer choices:

A: Yes - It's likely that it performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

B: No - It's not likely that it performed such actions.

Given the related TTPs, it seems that collecting network and system information is likely, as it aligns with the discovery techniques mentioned. However, the inclusion of "decrypting" in the question adds a layer of complexity.

If I had to choose, I would lean towards answer choice A: Yes, because the malware is likely performing discovery activities, and while decryption might not be strictly necessary for basic discovery, it could be part of more in-depth information gathering, especially if the system employs encryption for its configurations or data.

Moreover, since the malware is communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, it has an established channel to send the collected information back to the operators.

In conclusion, based on the related TTPs and the typical behavior of malware in the initial stages after establishing a C2 channel, it's plausible that Rising Sun performs initial reconnaissance by collecting network and system information, and possibly decrypting data if necessary.
