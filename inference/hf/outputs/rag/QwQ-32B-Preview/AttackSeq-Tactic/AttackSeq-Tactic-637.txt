Alright, I've got this question about GreyEnergy and their attack tactics. So, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about what ATT&CK tactic informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers before they achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.

The answer choices are:

A: Command and Control

B: Resource Development

C: Collection

D: Reconnaissance

And there are related TTPs provided: Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link.

Okay, so I need to think about the sequence of events in an attack. GreyEnergy used spearphishing and exploited public-facing web servers to get initial access. But before that, they must have done some planning to decide who to target and how. That sounds like reconnaissance to me.

Let me look at each option:

A: Command and Control - This is about maintaining control over compromised systems after gaining access. That seems like it happens after initial access, not before.

B: Resource Development - This is about developing resources for the attack, like tools or infrastructure. While this might happen before initial access, it's more about preparing the means to attack rather than identifying targets.

C: Collection - This is about gathering information from the target network after gaining access. Again, this seems to happen after initial access.

D: Reconnaissance - This is about gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and potential points of entry. This makes sense as something that would happen before initial access.

So, based on that, reconnaissance seems like the most logical choice.

But let's think deeper. The question mentions that they targeted ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers. So, they had a specific focus on these types of systems. That suggests that they did some research to find organizations that use such systems and perhaps even identified specific vulnerabilities in those systems.

Reconnaissance aligns with that because it involves gathering intelligence about the target's environment, including their systems and software.

Command and Control is more about maintaining access and communicating with the compromised systems, which comes after initial access.

Resource Development could involve creating phishing emails or setting up exploit kits, but again, that's more about preparing the attack vectors rather than identifying the targets in the first place.

Collection is about exfiltrating data or gathering information from the target network, which again happens after gaining access.

So, reconnaissance seems to be the tactic that would inform their strategic targeting before they even attempt initial access.

Moreover, the related TTPs are about initial access through exploiting public-facing applications and spearphishing links. Reconnaissance would be the preceding step where they identify which public-facing applications to target and who to send spearphishing links to.

Let me check the MITRE ATT&CK framework to confirm. In the ATT&CK matrix, reconnaissance is indeed a tactic that precedes initial access. It involves techniques like footprinting, spearphishing, and gathering open-source intelligence.

In this case, GreyEnergy likely conducted reconnaissance to identify organizations using ICS and SCADA systems, and then specifically targeted their public-facing web servers and employees with spearphishing links.

So, putting it all together, the tactic that most likely informed their strategic targeting is reconnaissance.

I think the answer is D: Reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D**
