Alright, I've got this question about cybersecurity, specifically related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is: "After spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files for initial access and utilizing the double extension trick for defense evasion, which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems?"

So, it mentions spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files and using the double extension trick for defense evasion. Then, it asks which technique facilitated communication with the compromised systems.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol

B: T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding

C: T1010 - Application Window Discovery

D: T1566 - Phishing

Now, I need to think about which of these techniques would most likely be used for communication with compromised systems after initial access and defense evasion.

Let's look at each option:

A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol: This involves communicating over protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc. These are common ways for malware to communicate with command and control servers. So, this seems plausible.

B: T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding: This is about encoding data in a way that's not standard, possibly to evade detection. While it could be used in communication, it's more about how the data is formatted rather than the communication method itself.

C: T1010 - Application Window Discovery: This is about enumerating open windows or applications on a system, which might be used for persistence or to gather information, but it doesn't directly relate to communication with the compromised system.

D: T1566 - Phishing: This is related to the initial access vector, not to the communication after compromise.

Given that, options C and D seem less relevant. C is more about enumeration on the system, and D is about the initial access method.

Between A and B, A seems more directly related to communication methods, while B is more about how data is encoded during communication.

But let's consider the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007 - Double File Extension

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link

So, the attack used spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files and the double extension trick for defense evasion. Now, after gaining initial access, the next step would likely be establishing communication back to the attacker's server.

In such scenarios, attackers commonly use standard application layer protocols to communicate with their command and control servers. This is precisely what T1071 - Application Layer Protocol is about.

On the other hand, T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding might be used to obfuscate the data being transmitted, but it's not the primary method of communication.

So, while encoding techniques can be used in conjunction with communication methods, the core technique for communication is more likely to be an application layer protocol.

Therefore, I think the most plausible answer is A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

To sum it up:

- The question is about the technique used for communication after initial access and defense evasion.

- Option A directly relates to communication methods, which aligns with the post-compromise activities.

- Options C and D are less relevant to communication.

- Option B, while possibly used in conjunction with communication, is not the primary method of communication.

Hence, the final answer is A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
