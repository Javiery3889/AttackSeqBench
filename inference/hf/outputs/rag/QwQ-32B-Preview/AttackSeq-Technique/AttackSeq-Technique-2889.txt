Alright, I've got this question about Cyber Threat Intelligence and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I need to figure out which technique is most likely used for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols after some discovery techniques. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the question itself:

"After using discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols?"

So, the attackers have already done some discovery by querying registry values and manipulating thread contexts. Now, they're setting up communication using HTTP and HTTPS. I need to choose the most plausible technique from the given options.

The answer choices are:

A: T1090.002 - External Proxy

B: T1498 - Network Denial of Service

C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol

D: T1106 - Native API

Okay, let's understand what each of these techniques entails.

Starting with A: T1090.002 - External Proxy.

This is a sub-technique of T1090, which is Proxy. Using an external proxy means that the attackers are routing their network communications through a proxy server that's outside the target network. This can help them mask the source of their communications or route data through different paths to avoid detection.

But in this case, the question is about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols. While using an external proxy might involve HTTP and HTTPS, it's more about the routing of traffic rather than the specific protocol used for communication.

Next, B: T1498 - Network Denial of Service.

This technique involves actions that degrade the performance of network devices or consume network bandwidth, leading to a denial of service. This doesn't seem relevant to establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS. In fact, it's the oppositeâ€”denying service rather than establishing communication.

So, B is probably not the answer.

Option C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

This technique involves using protocols within the application layer of the OSI model for command and control or data exfiltration. HTTP and HTTPS are both application layer protocols, so this seems directly relevant.

Looking deeper, T1071 has several sub-techniques, including T1071.001 - Web Protocols, which specifically mentions HTTP and HTTPS.

Given that the question mentions establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS, this seems like a strong candidate.

Now, option D: T1106 - Native API.

This technique involves interacting with the operating system at a low level using native APIs. Manipulating thread contexts could be related to this, as thread management is handled through system APIs.

However, while native API calls can be used for various purposes, including communication, it's not specifically about using HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It's more about how the code interacts with the system.

Given that, it seems less directly related to establishing communication using specific protocols compared to T1071.

Now, looking back at the related TTPs provided:

Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols.

This is a sub-technique of T1071, which we already considered. It specifically mentions using web protocols like HTTP and HTTPS for command and control communications.

This aligns perfectly with the question, which is about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS after some discovery activities.

So, considering all this, it seems that T1071 - Application Layer Protocol, specifically T1071.001 - Web Protocols, is the most plausible technique here.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A: T1090.002 - External Proxy.

While using an external proxy might be part of the communication setup, it's more about the method of routing traffic rather than the protocol used for communication. The question specifically mentions using HTTP and HTTPS protocols, which is directly addressed by T1071.

Option B: T1498 - Network Denial of Service.

This is clearly not related to establishing communication channels; it's about disrupting network services.

Option D: T1106 - Native API.

This could be used for various system interactions, but it's not specifically about establishing protocol-based communications like HTTP and HTTPS.

Therefore, the most logical choice is C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

To summarize:

- The question is about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS after discovery activities.

- T1071 - Application Layer Protocol, especially T1071.001 - Web Protocols, directly corresponds to using HTTP and HTTPS for communication.

- The related TTPs confirm that T1071.001 is relevant to the command and control tactic.

- Other options are either unrelated or less specific to the protocol usage described in the question.

Hence, the final answer is C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{C} \]
