Alright, I've got this question about BlueBravo's malware and its communication methods after gathering system information. The question is whether it's likely to use HTTPS for C2 communication and also possibly Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication. The answer choices are simply Yes or No. Now, I have to decide based on the related TTPs provided.

First, let's break down the question. So, the malware has already gathered some information about the victim's system, like the username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and running processes. That sounds like it's in the collection phase, right? After gathering this info, it needs to send it back to the attackers, which would involve some kind of command and control (C2) communication.

The question is asking if it's likely that this communication would use HTTPS protocol for C2, and also possibly use services like OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication. So, I need to think about whether these methods make sense in this context.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two mentioned:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols

2. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication

Okay, so both of these are under the Command and Control tactic, which matches what the question is about. The first technique is using web protocols for C2, specifically T1071.001, which is likely HTTPS, given that it's a web protocol and HTTPS is a common choice for evading network detection because it encrypts the traffic.

The second technique is bidirectional communication, specifically T1102.002. Bidirectional communication means that there's two-way traffic between the malware and the C2 server, which makes sense for maintaining control and receiving further commands or uploading stolen data.

So, considering these TTPs, it seems that the malware is expected to use web protocols, probably HTTPS, for its C2 communications, and also engage in bidirectional communication.

Now, the question is whether, in addition to HTTPS, it might also use services like OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication. Hmm, interesting.

First, let's think about why an attacker might choose to use cloud services like OneDrive and Dropbox for C2 communication.

Well, these services are widely used, legitimate, and often allowed through firewalls and proxies, which makes them good channels for exfiltrating data or receiving commands without raising suspicion. Plus, they offer bidirectional communication capabilities, which aligns with the second related TTP.

So, from that perspective, it makes sense that the malware might use these services for C2.

But, on the other hand, using well-known services also comes with risks. For example, these services have security measures in place, and abnormal activity might be detected and blocked. Also, relying on third-party services means that the attackers have less control over the communication channel.

Nevertheless, given that the related TTPs emphasize the use of web protocols and bidirectional communication, using services like OneDrive and Dropbox fits well within these categories.

Moreover, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, there are techniques related to using cloud services for C2. For instance, under T1102, there are sub-techniques that involve using legitimate cloud storage services for command and control.

So, based on this, it seems plausible that the malware would use HTTPS for C2 communication and also utilize services like OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

Wait a minute, but let's consider the context a bit more. The question says "is it likely" to use these methods. Likelihood can depend on various factors, such as the sophistication of the malware, the target's environment, and the level of evasion required.

If BlueBravo's malware is relatively basic, it might stick to simpler C2 methods, like direct HTTPS connections, without involving additional cloud services. However, if it's more advanced, it might employ multiple communication channels to ensure redundancy and evade detection.

Also, using cloud services could be a way to bypass network defenses that might not inspect traffic to these well-known services thoroughly.

Given that the related TTPs include the use of web protocols and bidirectional communication, which are both supported by services like OneDrive and Dropbox, it seems reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that the malware would use these methods.

Moreover, in real-world scenarios, threat actors do use such services for C2. For example, there have been instances where malware has used cloud storage services to receive commands or upload data.

Therefore, considering all these points, the most plausible answer is Yes.
