Alright, I've got this question about cybersecurity, specifically about whether a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 will likely establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed via employee-enabled macro execution, following some reconnaissance activities. There are two answer choices: Yes or No. And there are two related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided: one is under the Discovery tactic called T1018 - Remote System Discovery, and the other is also under Discovery called T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery.

First, I need to understand the question properly. It's saying that there's been some reconnaissance done, which includes gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods. So, the attackers have already done some preliminary work to gather intelligence about the target network. Then, they manage to install a malicious implant, specifically BlackEnergy 3, onto the network by getting employees to enable macros in some document or something like that.

Now, the question is asking whether, after all this, it's likely that this implant will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers. So, basically, is it probable that once the malware is installed, it will try to connect back to the attackers' servers to receive further instructions or upload data?

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to know what BlackEnergy 3 is. From my knowledge, BlackEnergy is a type of malware that has been used in various cyber attacks, particularly against energy sectors, hence the name. It's known for its capabilities in conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and also for data theft and gaining persistent access to networks.

So, given that it's a malware designed for such purposes, it's logical to assume that it would need to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands from the attackers and to exfiltrate data back to them.

But, the question is asking about the likelihood of this happening after specific actions have been taken.

Let's look at the reconnaissance part. The related TTPs are about discovery techniques. T1018 - Remote System Discovery is where attackers try to identify systems on the network that they can exploit. T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery is about understanding what network connections are active on a system, which can help attackers understand the network topology and find potential targets or pathways for lateral movement.

So, the attackers have already done some reconnaissance to map out the network and identify systems. They've likely gathered information about which systems are vulnerable and which ones are critical.

Then, they manage to install BlackEnergy 3 by getting employees to enable macros. This is a common social engineering tactic, where attackers send phishing emails with malicious attachments that contain macros, which, when enabled, execute the malware on the system.

Now, considering all this, is it likely that after installation, the malware will try to establish communication with C2 servers?

Well, most malware, especially advanced ones like BlackEnergy, are designed to establish a connection back to the attackers once they're installed. This is how attackers maintain control over the compromised systems and issue further commands.

But, I need to think about whether, in this specific scenario, it's likely to happen.

Let me consider some factors that might influence this.

First, the malware has just been installed on the network through social engineering. The employees enabled the macros, which executed the malware.

Now, depending on the network's security posture, there might be defenses in place that could prevent or detect such communication.

For example, if the network has egress filtering or uses firewalls that block unauthorized outgoing connections, the malware might not be able to connect to the C2 servers.

Alternatively, if the network has intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) systems that monitor for unusual outbound traffic, they might flag the malware's communication attempts.

Moreover, some malware is designed to lay low and not immediately communicate with C2 servers to avoid detection. They might have delays or only communicate under certain conditions.

But, generally speaking, the primary function of such malware is to provide a backdoor for the attackers, which requires communication with C2 servers.

Given that, it's reasonable to assume that yes, the malware will attempt to establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

But, the question is asking about the likelihood of this happening, considering the entire sequence of events.

Let me think about the sequence:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering public information and conducting active discovery.

2. Installation of malware through social engineering (enabled macros).

3. Establishment of communication with C2 servers.

Is there anything in this sequence that would suggest that the communication might not happen?

Well, if the reconnaissance was thorough and the attackers knew about the network's defenses, they might have designed the malware to bypass those defenses.

On the other hand, if the network has strong egress filtering or if the malware is detected during the installation phase, then the communication might be prevented.

But, assuming that the malware was successfully installed, as the question states, it's likely that it would attempt to communicate with C2 servers.

Moreover, BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware variant that is designed for persistent access and control, which typically involves C2 communication.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the nature of such malware, the answer should be Yes, it is likely that the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

But, to be thorough, let's consider why the answer might be No.

Perhaps in some cases, the malware could be configured to wait for a specific trigger before communicating, or maybe it's designed to only communicate over certain channels that are blocked in the network.

Alternatively, if the network has endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems that can quarantine or contain the malware immediately upon detection, then the communication might be prevented.

However, the question doesn't provide any information about the network's defenses or the specific configuration of the malware.

Therefore, based on the standard behavior of such malware and the information given, the most plausible answer is Yes.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
