Alright, I've got this question about malware behavior, specifically about PROMETHIUM and its tactics during the collection and exfiltration phases. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module during the Collection phase. It then asks whether it's likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

To answer this, I need to think about what typical behaviors malware might exhibit in these phases, especially given the specific techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

Let's look at the related TTPs first:

1. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560 - Archive Collected Data

2. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method

3. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits

So, PROMETHIUM is already using techniques related to archiving data during collection, and there's a specific subtype for archiving via a custom method. Additionally, in the exfiltration phase, there's a technique about data transfer size limits.

Given this context, let's consider what these techniques imply.

First, archiving collected data is a common practice for malware to efficiently package the stolen information before sending it out. This makes sense because it reduces the size of the data and makes it easier to handle.

The fact that PROMETHIUM is using a "custom method" for archiving suggests that it might be employing non-standard or less common archiving techniques, possibly to evade detection or to make analysis more difficult.

Now, moving on to the exfiltration phase, the technique T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits, indicates that the malware might be splitting the data into smaller chunks to avoid triggering alerts or to bypass limitations on data transfer sizes imposed by network policies or security solutions.

So, putting this all together, it seems plausible that after collecting and archiving the data using a custom method, the malware would then split the archives into smaller chunks for exfiltration, possibly encoding them in an unusual scheme to further obfuscate the data and evade detection.

But the question is asking specifically about whether it's likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltration.

Given that one of the related TTPs is using a custom method for archiving, which already suggests non-standard practices, and another is about data transfer size limits, which implies splitting the data, it seems reasonable to conclude that encoding the archives with an unusual scheme and splitting them into chunks is indeed likely.

Malware authors often employ multiple layers of obfuscation to make it harder for security researchers and defenders to analyze their tactics and to evade detection by security solutions.

Therefore, considering the provided information and the nature of malware behavior, I would choose "Yes" as the answer.

But let's think about this a bit more to make sure.

Is there any reason to think that the malware wouldn't encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks?

Well, if the malware is already using a custom method for archiving, it might already have mechanisms in place to obfuscate the data. Adding additional encoding and splitting the data could be seen as redundant or unnecessary. However, in the world of malware, multiple layers of obfuscation are common, so this isn't unlikely.

Moreover, splitting the data into chunks is directly related to the T1030 technique, which is listed as a related TTP. This suggests that this behavior is indeed part of the malware's modus operandi.

Therefore, overall, it seems consistent and likely that PROMETHIUM would encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltration.

So, my final answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**
