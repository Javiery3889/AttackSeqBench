Alright, I've got this question about Emissary Panda and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). I need to figure out if it's likely that after doing network reconnaissance to find systems vulnerable to EternalBlue, they exploited a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability to install webshells, and then used those to upload tools like Mimikatz and custom backdoors. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." To answer this, I have to look at the related TTPs provided, which fall under the Initial Access tactic and the Technique T1190, which is "Exploit Public-Facing Application."

First, I need to understand what Emissary Panda is. From my knowledge, Emissary Panda is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that's been active for quite some time. They're known for their sophisticated cyber operations, often targeting government and think tank organizations. They've been linked to the Chinese government, but, as always, attribution in cyber threats can be tricky.

Now, the question mentions EternalBlue, which is a vulnerability in the Windows SMB protocol. It's famous because it was used by the WannaCry ransomware in 2017. So, Emissary Panda was using EternalBlue to identify vulnerable systems. That makes sense as a reconnaissance step; they're looking for entry points into the network.

Next, the question suggests that after finding these vulnerable systems, they exploited a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers for initial access. Then, using these webshells, they uploaded tools like Mimikatz and custom backdoors such as HyperBro for execution.

Let me break this down. So, after finding systems vulnerable to EternalBlue, they're moving to exploit a SharePoint vulnerability to get a foothold. Then, using that foothold, they're deploying more tools to maintain access and potentially move laterally within the network.

I need to evaluate if this sequence makes sense, especially given the related TTPs provided.

First, let's look at the related TTPs: Tactic is Initial Access, and Technique is T1190, Exploit Public-Facing Application. This technique involves compromising public-facing applications to gain initial access to the network. SharePoint is often a public-facing application, so this aligns with the related TTPs.

So, in this context, exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability to install webshells would be an example of Exploit Public-Facing Application. That makes sense.

Now, is it likely that they would do this after already identifying systems vulnerable to EternalBlue? Well, EternalBlue is a way to exploit the SMB protocol, which could allow them to gain access to internal systems. However, exploiting EternalBlue might not necessarily give them direct access to the SharePoint servers, which are likely public-facing.

Perhaps they're using both methods to increase their chances of gaining access. Alternatively, they might use the SharePoint exploit to get initial access and then use EternalBlue to move laterally within the network.

But the question is specifically about whether, after using EternalBlue for reconnaissance, they exploited the SharePoint vulnerability to install webshells and then uploaded tools like Mimikatz and HyperBro.

Let me think about the sequence:

1. Perform network reconnaissance to identify systems vulnerable to EternalBlue.

2. Exploit the SharePoint vulnerability to install webshells.

3. Use these webshells to upload and execute tools like Mimikatz and HyperBro.

Does this sequence make sense?

Well, reconnaissance typically comes first to identify potential entry points. Exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability would be a way to gain initial access, and then using that access to upload further tools makes sense.

However, I'm a bit confused about why they would perform reconnaissance for EternalBlue and then choose to exploit SharePoint instead. Maybe they're using EternalBlue to identify vulnerable systems and then choosing SharePoint as a different entry point. It's possible they have multiple vectors and are using whichever is most effective.

Alternatively, perhaps they use EternalBlue to gain access to internal systems and then look for SharePoint servers to compromise for a more persistent presence.

But to answer the question, I need to determine if this sequence is likely, given the related TTPs.

Given that the related TTP is Exploit Public-Facing Application, which aligns with exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability, it does seem plausible.

Moreover, using webshells is a common technique for maintaining access and executing further commands on the server. Tools like Mimikatz are used for credential dumping, which can help them move laterally within the network, and custom backdoors like HyperBro allow for persistent access.

So, overall, this sequence seems reasonable for an APT group like Emissary Panda.

Therefore, I think the answer is "Yes," it is likely that they followed this sequence of TTPs.

But let me consider if there's any reason to think otherwise.

One possible consideration is that EternalBlue and the SharePoint vulnerability are from different times. EternalBlue was exploited in 2017, while CVE-2019-0604 is from 2019. So, if Emissary Panda was operating in a specific time frame, perhaps they wouldn't use both vulnerabilities together.

However, the question doesn't specify a particular time frame, so I'll assume that they could be using vulnerabilities from different years if the targets are still vulnerable.

Another consideration is that exploiting EternalBlue directly could give them access to internal systems, potentially bypassing the need to exploit a public-facing application like SharePoint. But as I thought earlier, using both methods could be a way to increase their chances of success or to have multiple entry points.

Additionally, exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability might provide them with a more legitimate-looking entry point, which could help them avoid detection.

Given all this, I still think that the sequence described in the question is plausible.

Therefore, my final answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

A: Yes
