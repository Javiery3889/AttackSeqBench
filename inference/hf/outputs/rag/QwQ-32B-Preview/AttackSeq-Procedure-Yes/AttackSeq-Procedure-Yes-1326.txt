Alright, I've got this question about CosmicDuke and its behavior regarding removable drives. The question is: After CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, is it likely that the malware searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts using techniques described under Data from Removable Media? And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand what CosmicDuke is. From my knowledge, CosmicDuke is a type of malware, specifically a backdoor, that's been associated with cyber espionage activities. It's known for its ability to exfiltrate data from infected systems. So, it's important in the context of cybersecurity and threat intelligence.

Now, the question is focusing on whether this malware likely searches removable drives for files as part of its data collection efforts. The related TTPs mentioned are under the tactics of Collection and Discovery, specifically Techniques T1025: Data from Removable Media and T1120: Peripheral Device Discovery.

Let me break this down. The tactic of Collection refers to actions adversaries take to gather data of interest from a compromised system. Technique T1025, Data from Removable Media, is about accessing and exfiltrating data from removable media like USB drives. On the other hand, the tactic of Discovery involves understanding the environment and identifying targets. Technique T1120, Peripheral Device Discovery, is about identifying connected peripheral devices, which could include removable drives.

Given that CosmicDuke is involved in discovery and collection of files from hard drives and network drives, the question is whether it would also target removable drives.

Let's consider the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To determine which one is more plausible, I need to think about the malware's objectives and capabilities.

First, if CosmicDuke is designed for cyber espionage, it would aim to collect as much sensitive information as possible from the target environment. This includes data on hard drives and network drives, which are primary storage locations. However, removable drives can also contain valuable data, especially if they are used for backups or transporting files.

So, from a strategic perspective, it would make sense for the malware to also search and collect data from removable drives.

But, I need to consider the technical aspects as well. Accessing removable drives might require specific permissions or handling, especially if the drives are not always connected or if they are encrypted.

Also, I should think about the risk of detection. Accessing removable drives could trigger alerts or unusual activity that might raise suspicions. Therefore, the malware might avoid this to maintain its stealth.

However, given that the related TTPs include Data from Removable Media and Peripheral Device Discovery, it suggests that these techniques are relevant to the malware's operations.

Looking back at the question, it specifies "using techniques described under Data from Removable Media." This implies that if CosmicDuke employs T1025, it would be searching removable drives for files.

So, if the malware is already targeting hard drives and network drives for discovery, and it uses techniques related to removable media, it's plausible that it would also search removable drives.

Moreover, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, these techniques are part of the same broader tactics of Discovery and Collection, suggesting a logical sequence or combination in an attack.

Therefore, considering the malware's objectives and the related TTPs, answer choice A: Yes seems more likely.

But, to be thorough, let's consider why answer choice B: No might be possible.

Perhaps, the malware focuses only on hard drives and network drives for efficiency or to minimize risk. Maybe accessing removable drives is too risky or not necessary for its objectives.

However, given that the related TTPs include Data from Removable Media, it suggests that this is a technique that is relevant and possibly used by the malware.

Additionally, in the context of cyber threats, especially those associated with espionage, malware often employs a wide range of techniques to maximize data collection.

Therefore, unless there's specific information indicating that CosmicDuke avoids removable drives, it's more plausible that it would include them in its data collection efforts.

In conclusion, based on the malware's objectives, the related TTPs, and the nature of cyber espionage, I believe that CosmicDuke is likely to search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
