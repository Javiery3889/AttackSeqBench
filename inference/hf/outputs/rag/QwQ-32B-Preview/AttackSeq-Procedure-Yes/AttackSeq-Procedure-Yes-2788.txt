Alright, I've got this question about the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices. It says that the app executes itself in the background, hides its icon, and restarts when terminated. Then it asks if it's likely that this app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending that data out via HTTP to its command and control (C&C) server. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." 

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about whether it's likely for this particular app to collect geo-location data and then exfiltrate it. The related TTPs provided are under the tactics of Exfiltration and Discovery, specifically T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1082: System Information Discovery.

Let me break this down. So, the app is running in the background, hiding its icon, and restarting when terminated. These sound like behaviors designed to maintain persistence and avoid detection by the user. Now, the question is about whether it would collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and then send that data out via HTTP to a C&C server.

Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, the app is executing in the background and hiding its icon. On iOS, apps typically don't hide their icons, so this suggests that the app is doing something unusual, possibly to avoid being noticed by the user. Also, restarting when terminated indicates an attempt to maintain persistence, which is a common tactic for malware.

Now, regarding the collection of geo-location data: is this likely? Well, geo-location data can be very valuable to an attacker for various reasons. It could help them understand where the device is located, which might be useful for targeting specific geographic areas or for other malicious purposes.

The related TTPs mention Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and System Information Discovery. T1041, Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, refers to the practice of exfiltrating data over the same channel that's used for command and control communications. This makes sense because it allows the attackers to use a single communication channel for both controlling the malware and retrieving stolen data, which can be more efficient and potentially less noticeable.

T1082, System Information Discovery, involves the adversary gathering information about the system to understand its environment better. This could include collecting various types of system information, and geo-location data could certainly be part of that.

Given that, it seems plausible that the app would collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine. The fact that it's hiding its icon and maintaining persistence suggests that it's trying to remain undetected while performing its activities, which could include collecting and exfiltrating data.

Moreover, sending data out via HTTP to a C&C server aligns with the T1041 technique of exfiltration over the C2 channel. HTTP is a common protocol for communication on the web and can be used to both send commands to the malware and receive exfiltrated data.

So, considering all this, it seems likely that the app would collect geo-location data as part of its discovery activities and then exfiltrate that data via HTTP to its C&C server.

But let's think about potential counterarguments or reasons why this might not be the case.

One possible consideration is that on iOS, apps have to request permission to access location data. If the app hasn't been granted permission to access location services, it might not be able to collect geo-location data. However, if the app has been installed and granted the necessary permissions, or if it has found a way to access location data without proper authorization, then collecting geo-location data would be possible.

Another factor is that iOS has various security measures in place to prevent apps from misbehaving, such as sandboxing and regular updates that patch vulnerabilities. However, if the app has found a way to execute itself in the background, hide its icon, and restart when terminated, it's possible that it has exploited some vulnerabilities that allow it to bypass these security measures.

Additionally, the fact that the app is specifically targeting iOS 7 devices might be relevant because iOS 7 was released in 2013, and there have been many security updates and improvements since then. So, it's possible that this app is taking advantage of vulnerabilities that have been patched in later versions of iOS.

In any case, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, it seems reasonable to conclude that the app is likely to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and exfiltrate it via HTTP to its C&C server.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."
