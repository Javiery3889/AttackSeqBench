Alright, I've got this question about a phishing attack that uses a malicious PowerPoint add-in with a VBA macro. The question is asking if it's likely that after gaining initial access through this method, the VBA macro will use 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL, and then the malware will create a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. I need to decide between "Yes" and "No" based on the related TTPs provided.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events described in the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in containing an auto-open VBA macro.

2. **Execution:** The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

3. **Persistence:** The malware creates a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic." This refers to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where T1059.005 is the use of Visual Basic for scripting malicious activities.

Let's break this down step by step.

**Step 1: Initial Access via Phishing Email**

Phishing emails are a common method for initial access. Attachments like malicious Office documents (including PowerPoint) with VBA macros are frequently used because many users trust Office documents and may enable macros without realizing the risk.

**Step 2: Execution using mshta.exe**

'Mshta.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool used to host web content, including scripts. It's often abused by attackers because it's a signed Microsoft executable, which can help bypass some security controls.

Using 'mshta.exe' to execute commands is a known technique. For example, an attacker might use it to download and execute a payload from a remote server. In this case, the dropper is said to be downloaded from a Blogspot URL.

Blogspot is a platform for hosting blogs, and it's been used by attackers to host malicious content because blog platforms are generally trusted and may not be blocked by default.

**Step 3: Creating a Scheduled Task for Persistence**

Establishing persistence is a crucial step for maintaining long-term access to a compromised system. Creating scheduled tasks is a common method for this, as it allows the attacker's code to be executed at regular intervals without user intervention.

Using 'mshta.exe' in a scheduled task to execute a specific URL every two hours makes sense because 'mshta.exe' can be used to run scripts hosted on a remote server. This allows the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system by periodically executing new commands or downloading additional payloads.

**Evaluation of Plausibility**

Given the above, the sequence described seems plausible:

- Initial access through a phishing email with a malicious Office document is common.

- Using 'mshta.exe' to execute commands and download payloads is a known technique.

- Establishing persistence via scheduled tasks is a standard procedure in many malware campaigns.

However, I need to consider if this specific sequence is likely. Let's think about alternative methods attackers might use.

**Alternative Methods**

- Instead of using 'mshta.exe', attackers might use other legitimate tools like 'powershell.exe', 'wscript.exe', or 'certutil.exe' for execution and downloading payloads.

- For persistence, they might use other methods such as modifying registry keys, creating startup entries, or using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

So, while the described sequence is possible, it's not the only way attackers operate. Some groups might prefer different tools and techniques based on their preferences, the target environment, or to evade specific defenses.

**Analysis of Related TTPs**

The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic." This aligns with the initial access vector described in the question, as VBA macros are written in Visual Basic.

T1059.005 is part of the larger T1059 technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which covers "Command and Scripting Interpreter." This technique includes using various scripting languages and interpreters to execute commands and payloads.

Given that the initial access involves a VBA macro, which is covered by T1059.005, and the subsequent steps involve using 'mshta.exe' for execution, which is another method under the Execution tactic, the sequence makes sense within the framework.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attacker behaviors and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
