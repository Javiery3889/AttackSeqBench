Alright, I've got this question about a cyber campaign that involves phishing emails, and I need to figure out if it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from an embedded Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails that contain a malicious Word file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No". To answer this, I have to look at the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided and see which answer makes the most sense based on those.

First, let's break down the question. It's asking about the likelihood of a specific sequence of actions in a cyber attack campaign. The sequence is:

1. Initial access is gained through phishing emails.

2. These emails contain a malicious Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.

3. The document likely contains VBS macros that will be executed.

I need to determine if this sequence is plausible based on the related TTPs provided.

Now, looking at the related TTPs, they are from the MITRE ATT&CK framework. There are two related TTPs:

1. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link

2. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

So, both of these are sub-techniques of Spearphishing (T1566), which is a common initial access vector in many cyber attacks.

Let's understand what these techniques entail:

- T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link: This involves sending phishing emails that contain malicious links, which, when clicked, can lead to the download of malware or direct execution of malicious code.

- T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment: This involves sending phishing emails that contain malicious attachments, such as documents, which, when opened, can execute malicious code.

In the question, the phishing emails contain a malicious attachment, specifically a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. So, this aligns with T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that this attachment will execute VBS macros after initial access is gained.

First, let's consider what VBS macros are. VBS stands for Visual Basic Script, which is a type of script that can be embedded within Office documents, including Word documents. Attackers often use VBS macros to execute malicious code on the target's system once the document is opened.

Given that the attachment is a Word document and it's malicious, it's plausible that it contains VBS macros designed to execute malicious code.

But, is it likely?

To answer this, I need to consider a few factors:

1. **Common Attack Patterns:** In many phishing campaigns, especially those targeting enterprises, attackers use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments that contain macros. These macros, when enabled, can download and execute malware on the victim's system.

2. **User Behavior:** Users who open the document and enable macros would inadvertently allow the execution of malicious code. However, many users are now aware of the risks and might be cautious about enabling macros.

3. **Document Type:** Word documents are a common vector for macro-based attacks because Word allows macros, and many users are familiar with using Word documents.

4. **Alternative Methods:** Attackers might also use other methods to execute code, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the document parser (e.g., CVEs in Microsoft Office) without needing macros.

Given that both related TTPs are spearphishing techniques, and specifically, one is spearphishing attachment, which matches the scenario described in the question, it's reasonable to conclude that using a malicious attachment with VBS macros is a likely approach.

Moreover, VBS macros have been a staple in phishing attacks for many years due to their effectiveness and the prevalence of Office documents in business environments.

Therefore, considering the related TTPs and the commonality of using macros in malicious Word documents, it's likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

Wait a minute, but I should also consider if there might be other factors that could make this unlikely.

For example:

- If the organization has strict email filtering and attachment scanning, the malicious document might be blocked before reaching the user.

- If the Word application is configured to block macros or if the user is unlikely to enable macros, then the execution might not occur.

However, the question is about the likelihood based on the attack sequence described, assuming that the email and attachment have reached the user and the user has opened the document.

Additionally, the related TTPs confirm that spearphishing with attachments is being used, which supports the likelihood of macros being used.

Therefore, overall, it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Word document.

So, my final answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
