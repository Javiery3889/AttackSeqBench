Alright, I've got this question about some cyber threat stuff. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the question is about whether a group, presumably Agrius, after using something called 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to talk to their command and control (C2) servers over HTTP and doing things like updating relays or downloading files, would likely go on to deploy wipers like 'Apostle', which was later turned into ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems. And I have to choose between "Yes" and "No" based on some related tactics and techniques.

First, I need to break down the question. It mentions 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which is a way for attackers to communicate with their C2 servers without being detected easily, using HTTP, which is common on networks. So, they can update their tools or download new files onto the target system. Then, it asks if it's likely that after these activities, they would deploy wipers or ransomware to destroy data.

Now, looking at the answer choices: A is "Yes" and B is "No". I need to decide which one makes more sense based on the information provided and my knowledge of cybersecurity and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The related TTPs, which are Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, are given: Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction; and Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion. So, these are relevant to the question.

Let me look up what these mean in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. T1485-Data Destruction is about actions designed to damage or destroy data on a system, which aligns with the concept of wipers or ransomware that deletes or encrypts data. T1070.004-File Deletion is a specific technique under Defense Evasion where attackers delete files to cover their tracks or remove evidence of their activities.

So, in the context of the question, after using the backdoor to communicate and perform updates or downloads, the next step might involve actions that fit under the Impact tactic, like data destruction, or defense evasion, like file deletion.

Now, the question is speculating whether Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', which was later turned into ransomware, to destroy data. So, is this likely based on the activities described?

Well, using a backdoor to communicate with C2 and perform updates or downloads is a common step in an attack chain. Attackers first gain access, then establish persistence, and laterally move within the network before they carry out their final objectives, which could be exfiltrating data, conducting espionage, or causing disruption.

In this case, the final objective seems to be destroying data, as suggested by the mention of wipers and ransomware. Wipers are malware designed to destroy data, making it irrecoverable, while ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom for the decryption key.

The fact that 'Apostle' was a wiper that was later turned into ransomware suggests that the attackers might have initially aimed to destroy data but later modified their approach to also seek monetary gain.

Given that, it seems plausible that after gaining access and performing initial activities like updating relays or downloading files, the attackers would proceed to deploy such malware to achieve their destructive goals.

However, I need to consider whether this sequence makes sense. Typically, in a cyber attack, there is a progression from initial access through discovery, lateral movement, and finally, the impact phase, which could involve data exfiltration or destruction.

So, if Agrius has already reached the point of using a backdoor to communicate and perform updates, they might be preparing for the impact phase, which could include data destruction.

Moreover, the related TTPs mention data destruction and file deletion, which align with the actions of wipers and ransomware.

Therefore, it seems likely that after these activities, they would deploy wipers or ransomware to destroy data.

But, I should also consider why they would choose to destroy data. Maybe their goal is to cause disruption, destroy evidence, or extort money from the victim.

In any case, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, it appears plausible that Agrius would deploy such malware after the initial activities.

So, considering all this, I think the answer is "Yes", it is likely that Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems.

**Final Answer: A**
