Alright, I've got this question about a malware called skip-2.0 and its backdoor that uses DLL hijacking to persist on a system. Then, it's asking if after achieving persistence, it's likely to use multiple hooks in sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses before its Inner-Loader component does process discovery on MSSQL Server. The answer choices are simply Yes or No. I have some related TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to help me understand this.

First, I need to break down the question and understand each part. So, skip-2.0 is a backdoor that achieves persistence through DLL hijacking via the Windows SessionEnv service. DLL hijacking is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory where an application is likely to look for a DLL, and then when the application loads the DLL, it executes the malicious code instead of the intended one. This is a way to gain persistence because the malicious DLL gets loaded every time the application starts.

The related TTPs mention persistence and defense evasion, both using the technique T1574-Hijack Execution Flow, specifically T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking. So, this aligns with the initial method of persistence described in the question.

Now, the question is asking what happens after this persistence is achieved. It suggests that the backdoor might employ multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service to bypass authentication and evade defenses, and then its Inner-Loader component performs process discovery targeting MSSQL Server.

I need to think about whether this sequence makes sense based on the initial persistence method and the related TTPs.

First, let's consider what sqllang.dll is. I know that sqllang.dll is a component of Microsoft SQL Server, so if the backdoor is targeting this, it probably wants to interact with or manipulate SQL Server processes.

Hooking into sqllang.dll could allow the backdoor to intercept or modify SQL operations, possibly to steal data, alter queries, or gain unauthorized access. Bypassing authentication would be a key step in gaining access to SQL Server without proper credentials.

Defense evasion would involve techniques to avoid detection by security software or system monitoring. Hooking multiple points in sqllang.dll could help in evading defenses by hiding its activities or modifying how SQL Server operates to mask its presence.

The Inner-Loader component performing process discovery targeting MSSQL Server makes sense because it needs to find the target process to inject its malicious activities.

So, considering the initial persistence mechanism and the subsequent actions described, it seems plausible that after achieving persistence through DLL hijacking, the backdoor would attempt to hook into sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses before proceeding with process discovery.

But, I should also consider whether this sequence is likely or not. The question is asking if it's likely, given the initial persistence method.

Well, the initial persistence is achieved through DLL hijacking, which is a specific type of code injection. Using hooks in sqllang.dll would be another form of code injection or manipulation. So, from a technical standpoint, it's feasible.

Moreover, targeting sqllang.dll aligns with the goal of interacting with SQL Server, which could be a valuable target for malware aiming to steal data or establish a foothold in a network.

However, I should also consider if there are other, more straightforward methods that the malware could use instead of hooking multiple points in sqllang.dll. For example, perhaps there are less conspicuous ways to achieve the same goals.

But, given that the malware has already employed DLL hijacking for persistence, it might not be averse to using more aggressive techniques like hooking to achieve its objectives.

Additionally, the related TTPs include defense evasion, which hooking could be a part of, as it allows the malware to hide its activities.

Therefore, considering all these factors, it seems likely that after achieving persistence through DLL hijacking, the backdoor would employ multiple hooks in sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses before its Inner-Loader component performs process discovery on MSSQL Server.

So, my answer would be Yes.
