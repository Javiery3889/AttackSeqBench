Alright, I've got this question about Derusbi malware and its communication tactics. So, first things first, I need to understand what Derusbi is and how it operates, especially in terms of its command and control (C2) communications.

Derusbi, also known as Royal APT or Carbon, is a malware strain that's been around for quite some time. It's associated with various cyber espionage campaigns, particularly targeting governments, military, and diplomatic organizations. From what I recall, it's a backdoor Trojan that allows attackers to gain remote access to infected systems and perform various malicious activities.

The question mentions that Derusbi gathers system information and beacons this data to its C2 infrastructure via destination port 443. Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted and commonly used for legitimate web communications. Using this port helps the malware blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.

Now, the question is asking whether, after gathering and beaming system information via port 443, it's likely that Derusbi would employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Let's break this down:

1. **HTTP Beaconing with Obfuscated Communication:**

   - HTTP beaconing refers to the malware periodically sending signals or data to a C2 server using HTTP protocols. Obfuscating this communication means the malware is employing techniques to hide or make the data less recognizable to security systems.

   - Given that Derusbi is a sophisticated malware associated with APTs, it's plausible that it uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection. Techniques might include encrypting the data, using covert channels, or mimicking legitimate web traffic.

2. **HTTP POST Requests to /photos/photo.asp:**

   - Specifically, the question mentions HTTP POST requests to a particular URL path: /photos/photo.asp.

   - This seems quite specific. Typically, in C2 communications, malware might use various URL paths to interact with different parts of the C2 infrastructure or to carry out different functions.

   - Using a path like /photos/photo.asp could be an attempt to blend in with normal web traffic, making it seem like the traffic is related to uploading or accessing photos, which is a common activity on many websites.

Given this context, I need to evaluate whether it's likely for Derusbi to employ these specific tactics in its C2 communications.

First, let's consider the Related TTPs provided:

- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols**

  - This technique involves the use of web protocols, such as HTTP or HTTPS, for C2 communications. Derusbi using port 443 aligns with this technique, as port 443 is used for HTTPS, which is a web protocol.

  - The use of web protocols for C2 is common because they are allowed through most firewalls and are expected in normal network traffic, making it easier for malware to communicate without raising alarms.

Now, looking back at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide whether it's likely that Derusbi employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. **Is Derusbi likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication?**

   - Given that Derusbi is associated with APT groups, which typically employ sophisticated tactics to maintain persistence and evade detection, it's highly likely that it uses obfuscation techniques.

   - Using HTTP for beaconing is also plausible, as it's a common method for C2 communications.

2. **Is it likely to use specific URL paths like /photos/photo.asp?**

   - This is a bit more specific. While using specific URL paths is common in malware C2 communications, the choice of "/photos/photo.asp" seems somewhat arbitrary.

   - It's possible that the malware uses this path to mimic legitimate traffic or to target specific web applications.

However, without specific information about Derusbi's C2 mechanisms, I have to rely on general knowledge about APT malware behaviors.

Given that Derusbi is a sophisticated malware, it's likely to employ techniques such as using web protocols for C2, obfuscating communications, and using specific URL paths to interact with its C2 servers.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, the answer seems to be "Yes," it is likely that Derusbi employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

But wait a minute, is there any specific reason to doubt this?

Well, one thing is that "/photos/photo.asp" seems like a very specific URL path. While it's plausible that malware might use such a path to blend in with normal traffic, I don't have any concrete evidence that Derusbi specifically uses this path.

However, the question is about likelihood based on the given information and related TTPs.

Given that, and considering that Derusbi is known to use port 443 for C2 communications, and that it's associated with APT activities, which often involve obfuscation and mimicry of normal traffic, it's reasonable to conclude that it employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication.

Including specific URL paths like /photos/photo.asp is also plausible.

Therefore, the most likely answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
