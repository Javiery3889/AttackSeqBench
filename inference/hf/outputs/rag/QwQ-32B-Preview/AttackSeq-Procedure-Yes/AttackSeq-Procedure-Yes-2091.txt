Alright, I've got this question about whether attackers will likely move laterally across an organization's network after they've already mapped the internal network and collected administrative-level credentials. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." And there are two related TTPs provided: one under Initial Access using Domain Accounts, and another under Lateral Movement involving Lateral Tool Transfer.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is setting a scenario where attackers have already gained a foothold in the network. They've used a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network, which means they know what's connected and how it's structured. Additionally, they've managed to collect administrative-level credentials, which are high-value because admin accounts typically have broad access permissions.

So, the question is asking if, given these circumstances, it's likely that the attackers will proceed to move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising more workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, considering that the attackers have administrative credentials, they probably have the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. Administrative access typically allows them to install software, modify system configurations, and access sensitive data across the network. So, with such privileges, moving laterally should be relatively straightforward.

Second, the fact that they've already mapped the internal network using a tool like Cobalt Strike suggests that they have a good understanding of the network topology. This would help them identify high-value targets and plan their movements accordingly.

Now, looking at the related TTPs:

1. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002 - Domain Accounts

This refers to attackers using legitimate domain accounts to gain access to the network. In this scenario, they've not only gained access but also escalated their privileges to administrative levels. So, this aligns with the part where they've collected administrative-level credentials.

2. Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer

This technique involves attackers moving tools from one compromised system to another to perform further actions. This is directly related to lateral movement within a network.

Given these TTPs, it seems that the question is focusing on the lateral movement phase of an attack, especially since one of the related TTPs is specifically about lateral movement.

So, considering that the attackers have administrative credentials and have mapped the network, it would make sense that their next step would be to move laterally to other systems to expand their access and achieve their objectives, which could be data exfiltration, sabotage, or other malicious activities.

Moreover, in many real-world cyber-attacks, lateral movement is a common step after initial access and privilege escalation. Attackers often seek to establish a presence on multiple systems to ensure persistence and to move closer to their target data or resources.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, it seems likely that the attackers will indeed move laterally across the infrastructure.

But let's consider the alternative perspective as well. Maybe there are scenarios where attackers would not move laterally even with administrative credentials and network maps. For example, perhaps their goal was solely to map the network, and they don't need to compromise additional systems to achieve their objective. However, this seems less likely, given that mapping the network is usually a precursor to further actions.

Another consideration is the risk of detection. Moving laterally across the network could increase the attackers' exposure to security monitoring and logging. However, since they have administrative credentials, they might have ways to operate stealthily and avoid detection.

Furthermore, in many attack scenarios, especially those involving advanced persistent threats (APTs), lateral movement is a key step in the attack chain. APT groups often take their time to move through the network, establishing backdoors and collecting data over an extended period.

Given all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
