Alright, I've got this question about FIN13 and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). I need to figure out if Mandiant is likely to track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase, especially after they've already used web shells and custom malware for initial access and are moving on to using JSPRAT for execution.

First, I need to understand the context here. FIN13 is a known threat group, and Mandiant is a cybersecurity firm that tracks and reports on such groups. The question is asking about the plausibility of Mandiant tracking FIN13's activities, specifically focusing on the Reconnaissance phase.

Let's break down the question:

1. FIN13 has already exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) for Initial Access.

2. The question is whether Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. This is before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase.

So, essentially, it's asking if, given that FIN13 has used certain TTPs for initial access, it's likely that Mandiant would observe and track activities related to reconnaissance before moving to execution with JSPRAT.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide between these two based on the information provided and my knowledge of threat actor behaviors and how Mandiant tracks them.

First, let's consider the sequence of events in a typical cyber attack:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target.

2. Initial Access: Gaining initial foothold in the target network.

3. Execution: Running malicious code on the target network.

4. Persistence: Maintaining access over time.

5. Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher-level permissions.

6. Defense Evasion: Avoiding detection.

7. Credential Access: Stealing credentials.

8. Discovery: Mapping the network.

9. Lateral Movement: Moving within the network.

10. Collection: Gathering data of interest.

11. Exfiltration: Sending data out of the network.

12. Command and Control: Communicating with compromised systems.

Now, according to the question, FIN13 has already performed Initial Access using web shells and custom malware. The next step mentioned is using JSPRAT for Execution. The question is about whether Mandiant would track activities related to Reconnaissance before this Execution phase.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Reconnaissance is the first stage where threat actors gather information about their target. This could include identifying potential vulnerabilities, understanding the network architecture, and gathering intelligence on employees or systems.

Given that FIN13 has already gained initial access, it's likely that some level of reconnaissance has already taken place. However, reconnaissance can also occur throughout the attack lifecycle, not just at the beginning. Threat actors might perform additional reconnaissance after gaining access to learn more about the internal network and plan their next moves.

Now, considering Mandiant's tracking capabilities and practices:

Mandiant is known for its in-depth threat intelligence and tracking of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. They analyze threat actor behaviors, TTPs, and attribute attacks to specific groups based on various indicators.

Given that FIN13 is a known threat group, Mandiant likely has a profile on them, detailing their common TTPs across different attack phases.

In this scenario, since FIN13 has used web shells and custom malware for initial access, and is moving towards execution with JSPRAT, it's plausible that Mandiant would track any reconnaissance activities that precede or accompany these actions.

Moreover, the related TTPs provided give some context:

- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003 - Web Shell

- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery

- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003 - Windows Command Shell

From these, we can see that Discovery is mentioned, which is closely related to Reconnaissance. System Network Configuration Discovery involves querying system or configuration information to find network details, which is a part of understanding the target environmentâ€”something done during reconnaissance.

Given this, it seems logical that if FIN13 is performing Discovery techniques, they are gathering information about the network, which aligns with reconnaissance activities.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Mandiant would track FIN13's activities related to gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase, especially since such activities are integral to their overall attack lifecycle.

Additionally, Mandiant's tracking methodologies likely involve monitoring and attributing activities across all phases of the attack, not just initial access or execution. So, tracking reconnaissance activities would be part of their comprehensive approach to understanding threat actor behaviors.

Considering all this, the answer should be "Yes," meaning it is likely that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase.

Wait a minute, let's think about this again. The question is a bit tricky because it's asking specifically about whether Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before they employ JSPRAT for execution.

Given that FIN13 has already performed initial access using web shells and custom malware, it's possible that some reconnaissance has already occurred prior to that. However, the question seems to be focusing on whether, at this stage, Mandiant would track reconnaissance activities before the execution phase.

Moreover, the related TTPs include Discovery, which is post-initial access, as it involves system network configuration discovery. This suggests that reconnaissance activities might continue even after initial access.

But, to answer the question, I need to determine if it's likely that Mandiant would track FIN13's reconnaissance activities at this point in the attack sequence.

Given Mandiant's expertise in threat intelligence and their focus on understanding the full scope of threat actor activities, it's highly probable that they would track reconnaissance activities, even if they occur after initial access.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

Wait, but let's consider if there's any reason to think otherwise. Is there any scenario where Mandiant might not track reconnaissance activities?

Well, Mandiant is known for its thorough analysis and attribution of threat actors. Their reports often detail the full range of activities performed by threat groups, from initial reconnaissance to exfiltration of data.

Moreover, tracking reconnaissance activities is crucial for understanding the threat actor's intentions, targets, and methods. This information is valuable for both attribution and protective measures.

Therefore, it's unlikely that Mandiant would not track reconnaissance activities.

Hence, the answer should be "Yes."

Just to be thorough, let's consider the alternative.

If I were to choose "No," that would imply that Mandiant is unlikely to track FIN13's reconnaissance activities. However, given Mandiant's reputation and practices, this seems improbable.

Therefore, "Yes" is the more plausible answer.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
